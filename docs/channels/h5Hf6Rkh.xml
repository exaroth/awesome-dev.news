He makes a bold claim:“Modern SSR frameworks like Next.js and Nuxt are essentially PHP with a new skin — just layered with extra build steps, more abstraction, and buzzwords.”As someone who spent years writing PHP and has since transitioned to building apps with Python, Vue, and Nuxt, I find myself half-agreeing. But not entirely. So in this post, I want to dig into the SSR comeback, how tooling has evolved, and share my personal take on developing across Python and the modern frontend landscape.
  
  
  1. From PHP to Python: How My Tools and Habits Evolved
I started out on the classic LAMP stack — Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP. I hand-coded HTML and jQuery, used Smarty templates, and later embraced Laravel as it rose in popularity.But last year, I made the shift to Python. Combined with Vue, Nuxt, and AI-assisted coding (auto-suggestions, API doc generation, etc.), my dev workflow saw a massive productivity boost.Richer framework ecosystem: Django is great out of the box; FastAPI is blazing fast for async APIs.First-class async support: asyncio, uvicorn, and coroutines feel natural.Works great with AI tools: Especially helpful in debugging, testing, and writing clean APIs.: When your app needs to crunch data, Python shines.Over time, I realized the switch wasn’t just about language. It was about rethinking how I build modern web apps.
  
  
  2. SSR Is Back — But Is It Just Modern PHP?
Maxime nailed a real developer deja vu:“It used to be that you could drop a .php file on your server and it would render HTML. Now with SSR frameworks, we’ve come full circle back to server-rendered pages.”This pendulum swing feels familiar:Early web: Traditional SSR (PHP, ASP, JSP) handled full page rendering.SPA boom: Everything moved to the frontend (React, Vue), which hurt SEO and slowed first paint.Now: Frameworks like Next.js and Nuxt are pushing SSR again as the best of both worlds.But is modern SSR really ?
We’ve added layers of hydration, streaming, edge functions, and complex build pipelines. Yet the core actions look familiar:Generate HTML dynamically based on requestsUse templating (now called "components")Rely on CDN caching (Varnish/Nginx did this too)Just like MVC in PHP years ago.Python’s seen similar evolution. With Django + HTMX, you get partial updates and no-refresh UX that mirrors the islands architecture. FastAPI + Jinja2? Also capable of server-rendered HTML.Many so-called "modern breakthroughs" are just old, solid ideas re-wrapped in new abstractions.
  
  
  3. The Pain of Polyglot Dev Environments — and How I Simplified It
Modern web development isn't just writing a  file anymore. You're juggling virtual environments, databases, middleware, frontend build chains, Node.js configs,  files, reverse proxies, local HTTPS certs... It gets messy.In one FastAPI project I worked on, the frontend was Nuxt 3, the backend used MongoDB, and Redis handled async task queues. Just getting the local dev environment up and running was painful. Debugging was even worse.Then I tried .
It pre-configured my entire toolchain (Python + FastAPI + MongoDB + Redis + Node.js) into one unified environment that starts with a click.It auto-set my  and certificates, offered a visual service dashboard, and let me launch frontend/backend separately without drowning in dependencies.As a fullstack dev constantly switching context, ServBay drastically cut down setup overhead and mental fatigue.
  
  
  4. Python + Vue/Nuxt: A New Paradigm for Reactive Development
What excites me most about Python today is how it meshes with the modern frontend.Old-school Django favored full-page templates. Now we’ve got:: Async-ready, API-first, clean separation of concerns: Enable partial updates with server-rendered performance: Effortlessly handle background jobs and scheduling: Yes, you can even run Python in the browser!Put these together and you get something Inertia.js-like: state sharing between frontend and backend, minimal API boilerplate, high-performance responsiveness.
  
  
  5. My Stack in Practice: Tools, AI, and Rational Choices
In my last two projects, here’s what I used:: FastAPI + MongoDB + Celery: Nuxt 3 + VueUse: Gemini, GitHub Copilot, custom-trained doc assistantSpeed, deploy time, debugging ease — all were dramatically better than what I had back in the LAMP days.And it got me thinking: maybe tech isn’t getting  complex. Maybe we’re finally building the right abstractions around it — via tools, frameworks, and AI.
  
  
  6. Final Thoughts: Embracing Complexity Without Losing Sight
We often say "complexity is the enemy of engineering." But in truth, our reality  complex:Business logic is more demandingUsers expect lightning-fast, personalized experiencesTeams are more cross-functional than everWe can’t solve all that with one PHP script — or even one Python module.Use better frameworks to make dev feel intuitiveChoose the right tooling to simplify setupRely on AI and automation to scale our impactThat Maxime quote still rings true:"The so-called SSR revolution is just us remembering why it worked in the first place."Whether you write PHP, Python, Go, or Java, the end goal remains:Deliver faster, more reliable services.If you’re stuck juggling languages, wrangling SSR, or overwhelmed by dev environments, give these modern tools a shot. And feel free to reach out.Tech isn’t black and white. Often, the best solutions live in the middle.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>10 Benefits of Hiring an Agentic AI Development Company for Digital Transformation</title><link>https://dev.to/sparkout/10-benefits-of-hiring-an-agentic-ai-development-company-for-digital-transformation-3b81</link><author>AI Development Company</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 3 Jul 2025 09:47:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The rapid pace of technological innovation is forcing businesses in Coimbatore and across the globe to rethink their strategies for growth and efficiency.

Nestled in the heart of the Bavarian Alps, Neuschwanstein Castle stands as a testament to the whimsical vision of King Ludwig II of Bavaria. With its soaring towers, intricate spires, and picturesque location, the castle looks like it was plucked straight from a storybook. This iconic structure, often referred to as the "Fairytale Castle," has become one of Germany's most beloved tourist destinations, attracting over a million visitors each year.
As you approach the castle, the breathtaking beauty of the surrounding landscape greets you. The lush, green forests and the serene Alpsee Lake below provide a stunning backdrop, making Neuschwanstein not just a historical site, but a place where nature and architecture come together in perfect harmony.
A King’s Dream: The Vision of Ludwig II
Neuschwanstein Castle was born out of King Ludwig II's desire to create a personal retreat where he could escape the pressures of royal life. Deeply inspired by the operas of Richard Wagner and the romanticism of medieval legends, Ludwig envisioned a castle that would embody the spirit of these tales.
Construction of the castle began in 1869, but Ludwig never saw its completion. Despite this, Neuschwanstein stands today as a symbol of his eccentricity and love for art and culture. The castle's design draws heavily from Romanesque and Gothic styles, with an interior that reflects Ludwig's passion for opulence and detail.
Exploring the Castle: A Journey Through Time and Fantasy
Visitors to Neuschwanstein Castle are treated to an immersive experience that combines history with the fantastical elements of Ludwig's imagination. As you step inside, the grandeur of the Throne Room is immediately striking. Inspired by Byzantine architecture, this room is adorned with a magnificent chandelier, intricate mosaics, and a throne platform that was never completed, symbolizing Ludwig’s unattained aspirations.The Singers’ Hall, another highlight, is a tribute to the medieval minstrel culture that Ludwig adored. The room’s high ceilings, painted frescoes, and exquisite woodwork evoke the grandeur of royal banquets and performances. This hall, much like the entire castle, was dedicated to the legends of knights and heroes, particularly those from Wagner’s operas.
One of the most enchanting rooms is the King’s Bedroom, a Gothic-inspired space complete with a hand-carved canopy bed and murals depicting scenes from Wagner’s Tristan and Isolde. The bedroom’s blue hues, intricate woodwork, and stained glass windows add to the mystical aura, transporting visitors back to a time of chivalry and romance.
“A World of Fantasy Within Walls”
Neuschwanstein Castle is often described as “a world of fantasy within walls.” This quote perfectly captures the essence of Ludwig II’s masterpiece, where every corner and corridor tells a story of myth and legend. The castle’s interior is adorned with scenes from Germanic sagas, with swans, the symbol of purity and love, appearing frequently throughout the decor.
Ludwig’s obsession with creating a fantastical world extended to the castle’s technological advancements as well. Neuschwanstein was equipped with state-of-the-art features for its time, including central heating, running water, and even a telephone line—testament to the king’s forward-thinking mindset.
The Surrounding Beauty: Bavarian Alps and Alpsee LakeWhile the castle itself is a marvel, the surrounding landscape is equally captivating. The Bavarian Alps, with their rugged peaks and deep valleys, provide a dramatic backdrop that enhances the fairytale atmosphere of Neuschwanstein. The nearby Alpsee Lake, with its crystal-clear waters, is perfect for a leisurely stroll or boat ride, offering visitors a chance to reflect on the natural beauty that envelops the castle.
For those seeking adventure, the nearby Tegelberg Mountain offers hiking trails with panoramic views of the region. In winter, the area transforms into a snow-covered wonderland, with skiing and snowboarding opportunities that attract outdoor enthusiasts from around the world.
A Journey to Nearby Hohenschwangau Castle
Just a short distance from Neuschwanstein lies Hohenschwangau Castle, the childhood home of King Ludwig II. This 19th-century castle, built by Ludwig's father, King Maximilian II, offers a more intimate glimpse into the royal family’s life. While Neuschwanstein is known for its grandeur and fantasy, Hohenschwangau provides a contrast with its warm, lived-in feel and historical significance.
Visitors often combine tours of both castles, gaining a deeper understanding of Ludwig’s upbringing and the influences that shaped his vision for Neuschwanstein. The two castles, each unique in their own right, together tell the story of a king who was both a dreamer and a realist.
“An Unfinished Symphony in Stone”
Neuschwanstein Castle is often referred to as “an unfinished symphony in stone,” a metaphor that reflects both its incomplete construction and the unfulfilled dreams of King Ludwig II. The king’s tragic death in 1886, under mysterious circumstances, left many aspects of the castle unfinished. Despite this, the castle's allure remains undiminished, attracting millions of visitors who come to marvel at its beauty and contemplate the enigmatic figure behind its creation.
Practical Tips for Visiting Neuschwanstein Castle
For travelers planning a visit to Neuschwanstein Castle, a few practical tips can enhance the experience:Timing: To avoid the crowds, plan your visit early in the morning or later in the afternoon, especially during peak tourist season (May to September). Booking tickets in advance is highly recommended, as the castle’s popularity means that tours often sell out quickly.
Getting There: Neuschwanstein is located near the town of Füssen, approximately a two-hour drive from Munich. Visitors can reach the castle by car, train, or through guided tours. From Füssen, buses and horse-drawn carriages are available to transport visitors up the steep hill to the castle.
What to Bring: Comfortable walking shoes are essential, as there is a fair amount of walking involved, especially if you choose to explore the surrounding trails. Don’t forget your camera—there are countless photo opportunities, from the castle itself to the breathtaking views of the Bavarian Alps.
Seasonal Considerations: Each season offers a different experience. In summer, the vibrant greenery and blooming flowers create a picture-perfect scene, while winter brings a magical, snow-covered landscape that adds to the castle’s fairytale appeal.
Conclusion: A Timeless Journey to the Heart of Bavaria
Neuschwanstein Castle is more than just a tourist attraction; it is a symbol of the enduring power of dreams and the human desire to create beauty in the world. Whether you’re a history buff, a lover of architecture, or simply someone who appreciates the finer things in life, a visit to Neuschwanstein is sure to leave a lasting impression.
As you walk through the halls that once echoed with the dreams of a king, you’ll find yourself transported to a different time—a time when legends were born, and fairy tales came to life. In the words of King Ludwig II, “I want to remain an eternal mystery to myself and others.” And indeed, Neuschwanstein Castle, with all its beauty and enigma, continues to captivate the imaginations of those who visit, offering a timeless journey to the heart of Bavaria.

Over time, this often leads to dozens, maybe even sometimes hundreds, of virtual environments scattered across our system. While they serve an essential purpose for dependency management and project isolation, they also come with an invisible cost: clutter and wasted disk space.Each virtual environment can consume hundreds of megabytes, or even gigabytes, especially when larger libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or SciPy are involved. Multiply that by the number of stale or abandoned projects on your machine, and you may be surprised how much space is quietly being eaten up.That’s where the Virtual Environment Analyzer comes in.This lightweight Python utility scans your directories, detects virtual environments, analyzes their size and last access time, and gives you a clear picture of where your disk space is going. Even better—it can help you clean up by safely removing the largest or most outdated environments with just a couple of prompts. Whether you're a solo developer or managing shared machines, this tool brings order to virtual environment chaos.
  
  
  The Problem: Virtual Environment Bloat
Virtual environments are a essential to Python development. They allow developers to isolate dependencies for each project, ensuring that packages don’t clash or interfere with one another. Whether you’re working on a Django web app, experimenting with machine learning models, or following along with a tutorial, chances are you’ve created a dedicated virtual environment for each task.This practice is not only encouraged, it’s necessary for clean, reproducible development. But over time, the benefits can start to backfire. Developers may accumulate dozens of virtual environments across different directories, most of which are no longer in active use.This leads to a few common problems:: Each virtual environment can take up hundreds of megabytes, or even gigabytes, especially when they include heavy dependencies. Multiply that by the number of forgotten environments, and the total can quickly balloon.: Virtual environments don’t usually announce themselves. They sit quietly in project folders, system directories, or tucked away under  names, making them easy to overlook during routine cleanup.: Large or deeply nested environments can significantly slow down system backups, antivirus scans, or file indexing processes, all adding unnecessary overhead for environments you no longer need.The result? A bloated development environment that’s harder to manage, slower to operate, and increasingly difficult to clean up manually.
  
  
  Meet the Tool: Virtual Environment Analyzer
Enter the Virtual Environment Analyzer, a lightweight yet powerful Python tool designed to help you take back control of your development environment.This command-line utility scans your file system to detect, analyze, and optionally clean up Python virtual environments. It intelligently identifies common venv folders (like , , , etc.) and checks for standard signs of a Python environment such as , activation scripts, or  and  folders. Once detected, it measures the size of each environment, checks when it was last accessed, and gives you an organized report.: Instantly find out how many virtual environments are lurking in your directories and how much space they’re consuming.Detect Forgotten or Unused Environments: Using access time analysis, the tool flags environments that haven’t been used in weeks or months, which are perfect for safe cleanup.: Built-in cleanup modes let you delete the top 5 largest environments or all those unused for a configurable number of days, all with clear prompts and double confirmation for safety.Flexible and User-Friendly: Whether you want a quick overview or a deep cleanup session, the analyzer offers a range of options like verbose output, custom directory scanning, depth limits, and more.It’s the perfect companion for Python developers who want to keep their workspace clean, efficient, and clutter-free, all without the hassle of manual inspection or risky deletion scripts.The Virtual Environment Analyzer is designed to be both powerful and practical. It combines robust detection, smart analysis, and cautious cleanup functionality to help you manage your Python environments safely. Here's a closer look at what it offers.
  
  
  Comprehensive Venv Detection
The tool intelligently scans directories for virtual environments using a combination of naming patterns and internal file structure analysis. It doesn’t just rely on folder names, it looks under the hood to verify if a folder is truly a Python venv.Detection strategies include:Recognizing common folder names:, , , Checking for venv-specific markers:    Activation scripts (, , etc.)This dual-layer approach ensures reliable identification, even when environments are hidden in deeply nested or custom-named folders.
  
  
  Size and Access Time Analysis
Once virtual environments are detected, the tool analyzes each one for size and usage history.Human-Readable Size Reports: Each venv’s size is displayed in KB, MB, or GB, making it easy to spot disk hogs at a glance. The tool examines the last accessed timestamp of key venv files, like Python executables, config files, and activation scripts, to determine if an environment has been used recently.This helps you quickly identify which environments are active and which are candidates for removal.To help you reclaim disk space, the analyzer provides two optional cleanup modes: Sorts all found environments by size and allows you to delete the five biggest ones, ideal for a fast disk space recovery. Automatically detects and deletes environments that haven’t been accessed in a user-defined number of days (e.g., 30, 60, or 90+ days).Each mode includes a clear preview of what will be deleted, how much space will be freed, and how recently each environment was used.Cleanup features are built with developer safety in mind: You’ll be asked to confirm deletion twice, including typing , to avoid accidental data loss. Permission errors, inaccessible files, and deletion issues are all caught and reported without crashing the script.This ensures that even in large, complex directories, the tool remains stable, safe, and predictable.
  
  
  How It Works Under the Hood
The Virtual Environment Analyzer works using a sequence of smart file system operations to identify, assess, and clean up Python virtual environments (venvs). Here’s a breakdown of what happens behind the scenes:
  
  
  Directory Scanning with Depth Control
The script begins by scanning the specified root directory recursively, using  and  to traverse subdirectories. You can limit how deep it goes via the  argument. This is useful for avoiding unnecessary traversal into deeply nested folders.Avoids permission errors with safe try-except blocks.Allows unlimited depth if not specified.Skips hidden or inaccessible folders.As each folder is visited, the tool checks whether it resembles a virtual environment. It uses both  (like , , etc.) and structure-based indicators (presence of , , , or  scripts).Detects both standard and unconventional venv naming patterns.Works across platforms (Unix and Windows).Can handle custom-named or renamed venvs.Once a venv is identified, the tool calculates its total disk usage. It sums the sizes of all regular files inside the folder tree using .Ignores unreadable files to prevent crashes.Skips symlinks and non-file objects.Outputs size in human-readable form with .The tool then evaluates when the venv was last accessed. It checks not only the folder itself but also important venv files (like , , ) to get the most accurate timestamp.Uses  to fetch last access times.Marks venvs as "unused" if not touched in  days.Sorts unused venvs by oldest access time to prioritize deletion.
  
  
  Interactive Cleanup Process
If any unused venvs are found, the script offers an optional cleanup step. You’ll be prompted with a summary and asked to confirm before deletion. You can also opt to delete the top 5 largest venvs for quick wins.Shows detailed stats or a summary, depending on verbosity.Double-confirmation required before deletion to prevent mistakes.Displays how much space will be or was freed.Here is an example of the script analysing my GitHub local folder:.venv D:itHubenv-analyzer>python venv_analyzer.py d:ithub

The idea was to automatically collect and organize data from a web page without manually copying and pasting the information.I'll walk you through the process step-by-step, including what each part of the code does and some challenges I faced during the project.Pandas: For handling tabular data.
Requests: To make HTTP requests and fetch web pages.
BeautifulSoup: To parse and extract data from HTML.Step 1: Import the Required Librariesimport pandas as pd
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
We import the necessary Python libraries to perform web scraping (requests and BeautifulSoup) and data handling (pandas).Step 2: Request the Wikipedia Pageurl = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companies_of_Bangladesh'
page = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(page.text, 'html.parser')
We fetch the HTML content of the Wikipedia page using requests.get(), then parse it using BeautifulSoup with the HTML parser.Step 3: Locate the Target Tabletable = soup.find('table', class_='wikitable sortable')
We find the specific HTML table that contains the list of Bangladeshi companies. Wikipedia uses a table with the class 'wikitable sortable'.Step 4: Extract Table Headersc_titles = table.find_all('th',  attrs={"rowspan": "2"})
c_table_titles = [title.text.strip() for title in c_titles]
We extract the table headers (column titles) by finding  tags with rowspan="2" (which identifies the actual column names).Step 5: Set Up the DataFramedf = pd.DataFrame(columns=c_table_titles)
We create an empty DataFrame with the correct column names. This prepares us to insert the actual company data.Step 6: Extract Data Rowscolumn_data = table.find_all('tr')
headers = [th.get_text(strip=True) for th in table.find_all('th', attrs={'rowspan': '2'})]
expected_columns = len(headers)

data_rows = []

for row in column_data[2:]:  # skip header rows
    row_data = row.find_all('td')
    individual_row_data = [td.get_text(strip=True) for td in row_data]

    # Remove extra columns if they exist
    if len(individual_row_data) > expected_columns:
        individual_row_data = individual_row_data[:expected_columns]

    # Skip rows with wrong column count
    if len(individual_row_data) != expected_columns:
        continue

    data_rows.append(individual_row_data)

We loop through all the table rows (skipping the first two header rows) and extract the text from each cell . We also ensure each row matches the expected number of columns and remove any extra or irregular data.Step 7: Create and Save the Final DataFramedf = pd.DataFrame(data_rows, columns=headers)
df.to_csv('Companies_Of_BD.csv')

We create a final DataFrame using the collected data and headers, then export it to a CSV file named 'Companies_Of_BD.csv'.Every project has its share of hiccups. Here are some issues I ran into:In the table I scraped from Wikipedia, there were six column headers, so each row should have six data values. However, some rows had eight values due to extra columns like status indicators and footnote references. This mismatch could cause errors when creating the DataFrame. I needed to remove the extra values to ensure each row had only six pieces of data, allowing the final CSV file to be clean and usable.
The final result is a clean CSV file that contains a structured list of companies in Bangladesh from Wikipedia. This dataset can now be used for analysis, visualizations, or just general reference.
This was a great beginner-friendly project to learn about web scraping, HTML structure, and data cleaning in Python. It taught me how to be careful with real-world web data and handle unexpected formatting issues.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title># Introducing FormatWeaver: The Universal File Format Converter for Developers</title><link>https://dev.to/helpothon/-introducing-formatweaver-the-universal-file-format-converter-for-developers-4k8k</link><author>Helpothon</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 3 Jul 2025 06:21:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, the need for seamless file conversions is more critical than ever.

You can freely choose the format for how dates are displayed,  while keeping the underlying value a true numeric date. This makes it easy to display dates in various ways without affecting filtering or sorting. Python (using pandas) uses datetime64(ns) type and stores timestamps. This is efficient but it works differently from SAS.2. Working with formatted datesAs I have just mentioned, SAS separates date values from their display format. You can show a date as , , or however you like, and still filter and sort as if it is a number. It is very convenient for reporting.In Python, however, if you want to show a date formatted like "31/12/2025", you typically use , which converts the datetime object to a string.As I quickly learned, this is not an option in most cases because strings don’t sort chronologically the same way as datetime objects do. 
Keep everything (or convert early to) in  and stay in this format for as long as possible. Do your logic, filtering, and sorting with objects. Only format to string at the very final step, for example, when exporting data to Excel, CSV, or creating a report where the recipient expects a specific format. This ensures your data is consistent and behaves correctly. 3. Maximum date limitationIn SAS using  as the maximum or an open-ended date is totally acceptable as it is treated as a valid numeric date.But in pandas the maximum allowed date is 2262-04-11 (corresponding to datetime 2262-04-11 23:47:16.854775807 😅). So, when we wanted to repeat SAS report logic with  in Python, we got an out-of-bounds error:Here are three practical strategies how to handle it in Python. Let’s check an example below.
We are fetching data from the server where the end_date is  for active rows. We have Tom, William, and Olivia as an employees. We want to generate a report showing their salaries on reporting date 2025-06-30. 1. Use a substitute max date like 2262-04-11If you must show , and logic doesn’t depend on datetime operations you can just use string, you can leave it as  or replace with some meaningful documented word, such as:This approach, however, is not suitable for sorting or comparisons, so only use for display or export.In the scanario given above, we should still convert to  as we want to filter valid rows for the given reporting date.3. Use native  ( dtype)If you need more range but want to retain datetime objects use Python’s built-in datetime type.This stores the column as object instead of datetime64, so you lose vectorized operations but keep date accuracy up to year 9999. This allows correct sorting, but performance is slower.We are spoiled by SAS which gives a lot of flexibility when it comes to handling dates. Sometimes it can be a bit of a headache when everyone in your team prefers different formatting when creating a report :). So, I actually like that Python is strict and limited to timestamps. This gives you one standard to follow.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Build a Diabetes Prediction Web App Using Machine Learning - A Beginner-Friendly Project Guide</title><link>https://dev.to/aagama_ar/build-a-diabetes-prediction-web-app-using-machine-learning-a-beginner-friendly-project-guide-3g10</link><author>Aagama AR</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 19:35:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey, have you ever wondered how machine learning can be used to predict diseases? In this  guide, I'll show you a step-by-step how to build a real ML model to predict diabetes using medical data - and then deploy it as a web app using Streamlit!No prior experience with ML? No worries. I'll break down everything into simple terms. By the end, you'll not only understand the key concepts but will have built and deployed your own working project.🧠
 ✅ How to use a real-world dataset for training a model
 ✅ What a classifier is and why we use it
 ✅ What it means to "train" a model
 ✅ How to save the model and use it to make predictions
 ✅ How to build an interactive web app (with no HTML or JS!)
 ✅ How to deploy your project online📊 The Dataset - Explained SimplyWe're using the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset from Kaggle. It contains medical records of women aged 21+, with features like:Pregnancies: Number of times pregnantGlucose: Blood sugar levelsSkin Thickness: Body fat measureInsulin: Insulin level in bloodDiabetes Pedigree Function: Family history of diabetesThe last column is Outcome:
0 = not diabetic👉 Our goal: train a machine to predict this Outcome using the other inputs.**
🛠️ Step 1: Project Setup
Make a folder like this:diabetes-prediction/
│
├── diabetes.csv            # Your dataset
├── train_model.py          # Trains your model
├── trained_model.sav       # Output file (saved model)
└── diabetes_app.py         # Streamlit web app
✅ Use a Virtual Environment
This keeps your project clean and avoids dependency issues.python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
✅ Install Required Librariespip install pandas numpy scikit-learn streamlit
Or if you have a requirements.txt:pip install -r requirements.txt
🤖 Step 2: Train the Machine Learning ModelLet's break this part down 👇💡 What is a Machine Learning Model?A model is a mathematical formula that learns patterns from data and then uses those patterns to make predictions. Just like how we learn from examples, the model "learns" from the dataset.We'll use a model called a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Don't worry about the name - just think of it as a smart classifier that tries to separate diabetic vs. non-diabetic patients.# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv('diabetes.csv')

# Split into input (X) and output (Y)
X = df.drop('Outcome', axis=1)
Y = df['Outcome']

We use 80% for training, 20% for testing - so we can see how well our model performs on unseen data.from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, stratify=Y, test_size=0.2)
Train the model using a linear classifier (fast and accurate for this type of data):from sklearn.svm import SVC
model = SVC(kernel='linear')
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
print("Training Accuracy:", accuracy_score(Y_train, model.predict(X_train)))
print("Test Accuracy:", accuracy_score(Y_test, model.predict(X_test)))
import pickle
pickle.dump(model, open('trained_model.sav', 'wb'))
Run the script:
python train_model.py

🌐 Step 3: Build the Streamlit Web App
💡 What is Streamlit?Streamlit is like magic 🪄 - it turns Python scripts into beautiful web apps without writing any frontend code.1. Load the saved model
model = pickle.load(open('trained_model.sav', 'rb'))


Create a function to make predictions
def predict(input_data):
    input_np = np.asarray(input_data).reshape(1, -1)
    result = model.predict(input_np)
    return 'Diabetic' if result[0] == 1 else 'Not Diabetic'


Design the app UI using Streamlit
import streamlit as st
st.title("🩺 Diabetes Prediction Web App")
preg = st.number_input("Pregnancies", 0)
glu = st.number_input("Glucose", 0)
bp = st.number_input("Blood Pressure", 0)
skin = st.number_input("Skin Thickness", 0)
insulin = st.number_input("Insulin", 0)
bmi = st.number_input("BMI", 0.0)
dpf = st.number_input("Diabetes Pedigree Function", 0.0)
age = st.number_input("Age", 0)
if st.button("Predict"):
    result = predict([preg, glu, bp, skin, insulin, bmi, dpf, age])
    st.success(f"The person is {result}")

▶️ Step 4: Run the App
Run this in your terminal:streamlit run diabetes_app.py

🎉 You'll get an interactive web page where you can input values and see results instantly.🧠 Common Questions (for Beginners)❓ What's the difference between training and testing?
Training = Teaching the model
Testing = Checking if it learned well❓ What does "saving the model" mean?
It's like saving a recipe so we don't have to re-cook from scratch each time.❓ Why use Streamlit?
It's beginner-friendly and avoids the complexity of HTML/JS/CSS. Perfect for data projects!_☁️ Optional: Deploy on Streamlit CloudWant to share your app with others?

So what is a Model in Django?
I understood Model as a Python class used to define the structure of your database.Django uses it to create tables automatically, based on your field definitions.It handles all data-related operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD). For example in my previous project I added this kind of model.from django.db import models

class Item(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
what is a View in Django?
A View is a Python function (or class) that handles the logic behind a page.It receives a request, fetches data (usually from the Model), and returns a response (usually a rendered Template).I created a view to fetch data from the database and send them to the template:from django.shortcuts import render

def home(request):
    return render(request, 'app1/home.html')


  
  
  TEMPLATE – Presentation Layer
So what is a Template in Django?A Template is an HTML file used to display content to the user.It uses Django’s built-in Template Language (DTL) to display variables, loop through data, and include logic.
So in both apps I used the the templates as in the previous article.URLs act like a bridge between the browser and the backend logic.
Then I used my URLs in my previous article.
  
  
  HOW IT ALL CONNECTS (MVT FLOW):
 View calls the Product model    View Model fetches data from the database    Model View passes data to the template    View Template displays data in HTML  TemplatePart    Django File Purpose-  models.py   Defines structure of database tables-   views.py    Contains logic to fetch/process data    templates/.html Displays data using HTML & DTL-    urls.py Connects browser requests to views
Understanding how each MVT part plays its role helped me finally see Django as a full web framework — not just scattered files. Now I can create real, working web pages powered by Python and databases, not just static HTML.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Django Architecture:Models, Views and Templates</title><link>https://dev.to/malicha_galma_1deb33044b2/django-architecturemodels-views-and-templates-4nik</link><author>Malicha Galma</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 18:32:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A beginner-friendly explanation of Django’s core design pattern
Django is a high-level Python framework that helps developers build secure and maintainable websites quickly. One of the most important concepts that powers Django is the MVT architecture, which stands for:– represents the data structure– handles presentationAlthough it's inspired by the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, Django takes a slightly different approach by introducing Templates instead of Controllers. That said, Django doesn’t force you to stick to a particular architecture — you can organize your app the way that works best for you.
In Django, a model defines the structure of your database tables. Each model is a Python class that inherits from models.Model, and each attribute maps to a database field.python
class Users(models.Model):
    full_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    bio = models.TextField()
        return self.full_nameThe above example will generate a Users table with full_name and bio as its columns.Models contain all the necessary fields and behavior for your data. They're the layer that handles all your database interactions — from creation to querying.
A view is where your logic lives. It’s a function or class that processes a request and returns a response. It may fetch data from the model and pass it to the template, or return a redirect or even JSON.python
Copy
def users_list(request):
    users = Users.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'users/users_list.html', {'users': users})The above function gets all Users from the database and passes them to a template named users_list.html. Views are usually stored in a file called  inside your app.
Templates are HTML files that allow you to display dynamic content using Django’s templating language. They include special syntax to loop over data, show variables, or include conditional statements.<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Users</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>All Users</h1>
    {% for user in users %}
        <div>
            <h2>{{ user.full_name }}</h2>
            <p>{{ user.bio }}</p>
        </div>
    {% empty %}
        <p>No users available.</p>
    {% endfor %}
</body>
</html>

In this example, the template loops through the list of users and renders each one. If the list is empty, it shows a fallback message.
To make your view accessible via a browser, you need to connect it to a URL pattern.python
from django.urls import path
urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.users_list, name='users_list'),
]This connects the root URL (/) of your app to the users_list view.
Here’s a quick rundown of how Django’s MVT pattern flows:A request comes from the browsersends the request to the right viewThe view fetches data from the modelThe data is passed to a templateThe template renders a response as HTML
Django’s MVT architecture breaks your app into three key parts:Manages the structure and interaction with the databaseHandles business logic and request processingTakes care of rendering the UIThis separation makes your code cleaner, easier to manage, and scalable as your project grows.Want to take this further?

By the end, you'll have an agent that can answer complex data questions, investigate performance issues, and deliver its findings through multiple channels. is a Python framework designed for building AI agents with specific performance characteristics:: Agents instantiate in approximately 3 microseconds and use 50x less memory than alternatives like LangGraph: Works with 23+ LLM providers including Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI: Native support for text, images, audio, and video inputs/outputs
: First-class support for reasoning models and chain-of-thought approaches: Includes memory, storage, structured outputs, and monitoring capabilities provides the data infrastructure for agents with:: Sub-second query responses at scale: Remote, hosted Model Context Protocol server that securely exposes workspace as AI-accessible tools: Full SQL support with advanced analytics functions: Every query becomes a documented REST API endpoint automatically. Natural language descriptions help agents discover these APIs as tools and use them to fetch data.Together, they create a robust foundation for building analytics agents that can explore data, detect anomalies, and provide intelligent insights.When building AI agents, you have several options for connecting to external services and data sources. For analytics use cases, it's important to differentiate between traditional text-to-sql MCP tools and API endpoint tools. Each provides tradedoffs for agent-to-data connectivity. Read more about MCPs vs APIs for agentic analytics.
  
  
  Step 1: Set up a Tinybird workspace
First, let's set up your data infrastructure. Tinybird will serve as the analytics backend that your agent queries.If you already have data in Tinybird that you want to work with, you can skip this section. If you have data in other places that you want to get into Tinybird, check out the ingest guides for more details on how to get data into Tinybird.If you don't have data in Tinybird and want to work with an example, follow along.First, create a Tinybird workspace.Install the Tinybird CLI:curl https://tinybird.co | sh
Authenticate with your workspace (or create a new one):tb login
Start the local Tinybird development server (note you'll need a Docker runtime):Initialize an empty workspace:You're now ready to start building a data project.Tinybird data sources define the schema and source connections (if applicable) for your data.For this example, we'll create a data source to store web analytics events. Create a file called  in the :datasources events.datasource
Paste the contents below into the file and save:Deploy the data source to your local environment:Use the Tinybird CLI's mock data generation feature to populate your data sources with realistic sample data:tb mock events  100000 The  command automatically generates sample data that matches your data source schema. This is much faster than writing custom data generation scripts and ensures the data types and formats are correct. Use the  flag to further refine the mock data, for example:Realistic timestamps distributed over recent time periodsCommon page URLs and referrer patterns
Geographic distribution of usersVaried session durations and page view countsThe command will generate two files in the  folder:A  file which defines the data generation'A  file containing the produced mock dataAppend the generated mock data to your data source:tb datasource append events fixtures/events.ndjson
You now have data in Tinybird. The next step is to create a few SQL-based API endpoints that your agent can use.Now, in theory, you could proceed without creating API endpoints and simply allow the agent to generate its own SQL queries. However, predefined API endpoints can help reduce latency and increase deterministic responses to common prompts, so let's create a couple analytical endpoints that the agent can query.Note the plain text description; use this to help agents discover the APIs as tools. The more descriptive, the better.Feel free to create additional API endpoints based on your use case. You can create them manually or use Tinybird's CLI:tb create 

tb create Deploy your data sources and endpoints to Tinybird local:You now have an active Tinybird workspace with data and API endpoints running on your localhost.
  
  
  Step 2: Instantiate an agent with Agno
Now let's set up the Agno framework to create our analytics agent.Create a new Python project and install the required packages:python  venv venv
venv/bin/activate
pip  agno python-dotenv
Create your first analytics agent in :Make sure to create a  file with your API key for whatever AI model providers you're using.This is a very basic agent without any tool access. We need to give it access to our Tinybird MCP Server so it has the tools it needs to explore the data, generate SQL queries, execute those queries, and call our published API endpoints.
  
  
  Step 3: Connect to the Tinybird MCP server
The Tinybird MCP Server automatically exposes your workspace resources as tools that your agent can use.The MCP server provides several key capabilities:Role-based access control: Access to the MCP Server is secured with a Tinybird token, so agents can only access data within the token scopes. You can use JWTs to offer fine-grained, role-based access to the Tinybird MCP Server.: Your Tinybird endpoints become callable functions that agents can use to fetch pre-calculated metrics.: The built-in  tool allows the agent to spawn  a server-side subagent with understanding data and developing queries.: Generate SQL queries with schema context.: Directly query the data sources.: List and query service data sources (those that contain your workspace logs) for debugging and performance monitoring.
  
  
  Configure the Tinybird MCP Server
Let's give our agent access to the tools made available via the Tinybird MCP Server.
  
  
  Understand MCP tool capabilities
The Tinybird MCP Server provides several tools automatically:: Natural language data exploration: See available API endpoints
: Run direct SQL queries: Direct access to each of your Tinybird endpointsExample of using specific endpoint tools:
  
  
  Step 4: Design system prompts and instructions
Effective prompt design is crucial for analytics agents (or any agent, for that matter). Here's how we recommend structuring prompts for different use cases.Create a generalized system prompt to help the agent understand its core role:You can then provide further instructional prompts, or "missions", depending on the contents of your Tinybird workspace and how you want the agent to analyze your data, for example:Here's how you might define an agent with a static system prompt and flexible missions:Finally, user prompts and conversations direct the actions of the analytics agent:Show me the top 5 pages by pageviews in the last 30 days
Which of those pages has the highest form submission conversion rate?
Which referrers get me the most traffic to the top converting page?
And so on. The Agno framework allows the agent to retain memory and context from a user session. It responds to each user prompt within the context of its system prompt, mission prompt, and the tools available to it.
  
  
  Step 5: Configure agent output options
Your analytics agent can deliver insights through multiple channels and even trigger new agents to process its findings. Here are a few options for output with implementation examples.The simplest option for development and testing:You can use an email provider like Resent to generate and send automated email reports:For complex analytics scenarios or when you want other agents to take action on the insights found by your analytics agent, orchestrate multiple specialized agents:
  
  
  Step 6: Add advanced features and production considerations

  
  
  Manage memory and context
Implement persistent memory for better contextual understanding:
  
  
  Handle errors and build resilience
Implement robust error handling:You can easily deploy your Tinybird resources to a production cloud environment:Deploy your agent using Docker and container orchestration:pip  requirements.txt

Analytics agents like those you can build with Agno and Tinybird can change how organizations and their customers interact with data. By combining Agno's performance characteristics and tooling with Tinybird's high-performance data infrastructure and AI tooling, you can create intelligent systems that not only answer questions quickly but also proactively monitor, investigate, and report on your data.Key advantages of this approach:: Agno's 3-microsecond instantiation time combined with Tinybird's sub-second queriesNatural language interface: Eliminates the need for complex SQL queries or dashboard navigation: Agents that detect and investigate anomalies automatically
Multiple delivery channels: Insights delivered via CLI, email, Slack, or APIs: Both platforms designed for production workloads with measurable performance characteristics
  
  
  What makes Tinybird essential for analytics agents
: Sub-second response times for analytical queries: Seamless tool discovery and automatic API generation: Full analytical capabilities without compromise: From prototype to production deployment: Pay-per-compute model with clear cost structureAs AI agents become central to data operations, having performant data infrastructure becomes crucial.

It’s designed to help developers build clean, efficient, and scalable web apps fast.At the heart of Django is something called the MVT architecture, which stands for Model, View, Template. It’s pretty similar to the well-known MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, just with some tweaks in terminology that make sense in Django’s world.
Django uses the MVT structure to keep your code organized and maintainable. Let’s break down what that means:Models — Your Database Tables
In Django, a Model is simply a Python class that defines the structure of your database table. It handles all the data creating, reading, updating, and deleting.When you define a model like Users, Django creates a corresponding database table behind the scenes. It’s clean, simple, and powerful.
Views in Django are Python functions or classes that handle incoming requests and return responses — like HTML pages, JSON, redirects, etc.
They interact with your models to get data and pass it to templates for display.
Example:This view fetches all users from the database and sends them to a template for display.Templates — The User Interface
A Template is basically your HTML file. It contains placeholders where dynamic data from your views shows up. Django comes with its own templating language, but you can also use alternatives like Jinja2.My UsersAll Users
    {% for user in users %}
        {{ user.full_name }}{{ user.bio }}
    {% empty %}
        No users available.
    {% endfor %}
Simple, clean, and easy to work with.URLs — Connecting the Pieces
To make your views accessible via the browser, you define URL patterns like this:Now when someone visits your site, they’ll hit your view, which talks to your model and renders the template.
The MVT structure keeps things tidy:
View: Contains your logic
Template: Displays the output
This separation makes your code cleaner and your project easier to scale as it grows.Hope this clears up how Django apps are structured!

How to Run AI Models Privately on Your AI PC with Model HQ; No Cloud, No Code
Rohan Sharma for LLMWare ・ Jun 27Step 1: Download Model HQ
Model HQ is an AI desktop application that allows you to interact with over 100+ top-performing AI models, including large ones with up to 32 billion parameters — all running locally on your PC.Unlike cloud-based tools, there’s no internet required, and your data never leaves your machine. That means more privacy, better speed, and zero cost for each query you run.In this blog, we will be looking into the CHAT feature of Model HQ that helps us to create a chatbot running locally on our machine.👉 Download or Buy Model HQ for WindowsNot ready to buy? No problem.👉 Join the 90-Day Free Developer TrialOnce installed, you’ll have access to an interface that feels like your own AI control panel.Step 2: Choosing the Right AI Model
Once installation is done, open the ModelHQ application, and then you will be prompted to add a setup method. The setup guide is provided after buying the application.After this, you will land in the main menu. Now, click on the Chat button.You’ll be prompted to select an AI model. If you’re unsure which model to choose, you can click on “choose for me,” and the application will select a suitable model based on your needs. Model HQ comes up with 100+ models.Available Model Options:
Small Model:
~1– 3 billion parameters:- Fastest response time, suitable for basic chat.Medium Model:
~7– 8 billion parameters:- Balanced performance, ideal for chat, data analysis, and standard RAG tasks.Large Model:
~9 – up to 32 billion parameters:- Most powerful chat, RAG, and best for advanced and complex analytical workloads.By the way, Model HQ will pick a smart default based on your system and use case.The size of the model you choose can significantly impact both speed and output quality. Smaller models are faster but may provide less detailed responses. Follow this simple rule:Step 3. Downloading Models
For demonstration purposes, we are selecting the Small Model.If no models have been downloaded previously (e.g., in the No Setup, Fast Setup, or Full Setup paths), the selected model will begin downloading automatically.This process typically takes 2–7 minutes, depending on the model you selected and your internet speed. This is only a one-time internet requirement; once the models are downloaded, you don’t need internet anymore.Step 4: Start Chatting
Once you’ve selected a model, you can start a chat by typing in your questions. For example, you might ask a simple question like, “What are the top sites to see in Paris?” The model will generate a response based on its training data.Customizing Your Chat Experience
Model HQ allows you to customize your chat experience further. You can adjust settings such as the maximum output length and the randomness of the responses (known as temperature). By default, the app is set to generate up to 1,000 tokens, which is usually sufficient for smaller models. However, even if you’re using larger models, be cautious about increasing this limit, as it can consume more memory and take longer to generate responses.

Python's Role


Mechanisms for Low-Level Interaction


Key Libraries

Python is widely celebrated for its high-level abstractions, readability, and vast ecosystem, making it a go-to language for web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and automation. Its interpreted nature and automatic memory management often lead to the perception that it is unsuitable for "low-level" programming tasks—those requiring direct interaction with hardware, operating system internals, or fine-grained memory control. However, this perception, while rooted in Python's design philosophy, doesn't tell the whole story. This article delves into the capabilities and mechanisms that enable Python to venture into the realm of low-level programming, demonstrating its surprising versatility.
  
  
  2. What is Low-Level Programming?
Low-level programming refers to coding that operates closer to the hardware and machine instructions, offering fine control over system resources. Key characteristics include:: Explicit allocation, deallocation, and manipulation of memory.: Communicating directly with peripheral devices, sensors, and other hardware components.Operating System (OS) Internals: Interacting with system calls, processes, threads, and file system at a fundamental level.: Often involves optimizing for speed and resource efficiency.Languages like C, C++, and Assembly are traditionally considered low-level due to their direct access capabilities.
  
  
  3. Python's Role: Strengths and Perceived Weaknesses

  
  
  Strengths for Low-Level Interaction
Despite its high-level nature, Python possesses several features that facilitate low-level interactions:: Python is written in C (CPython), and its design allows seamless integration with C/C++ code.: Modules like , , , , and  provide interfaces to operating system functionalities.: Python's speed of development is invaluable for prototyping complex interactions.Cross-Platform Compatibility: Many low-level interaction libraries work across different operating systems.Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): Restricts true parallel execution in CPython.: Higher execution overhead compared to compiled languages.: Distances the programmer from raw memory and hardware.

Unlike f-strings, which produce a  object, t-strings resolve to a  instance, allowing you to safely process and customize dynamic content.One of the key benefits of t-strings is their ability to help prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS attacks. They’re also valuable in other fields that rely on string templates, such as structured logging.By the end of this tutorial, you’ll understand that:Python  are a generalization of f-strings, designed to safely handle and process .The  of a t-string include  parts and , which are accessible through the  class.You process t-strings by iterating over their components, using attributes such as , , and  for safe and customized handling.Python t-strings enhance both security and flexibility in string processing tasks. This tutorial will guide you through understanding t-strings, comparing them with f-strings, and exploring their practical use cases in Python programming. Test your knowledge with our interactive “Python 3.14 Preview: Template Strings (T-Strings)” quiz. You’ll receive a score upon completion to help you track your learning progress:Exploring String Templates Before Python 3.14Creating string templates that you can populate with specific values dynamically is a common requirement in programming. A  is a string that contains placeholders—special markers representing variable values—that you can dynamically replace at runtime.You’ll often use templates to generate text or structured content by filling these placeholders with actual data. Before Python 3.14, the language provided several tools that allowed you to interpolate and format values in your strings:You can use all these tools to create and process string templates. Of course, each has its own unique strengths and weaknesses.The string formatting operator (), inspired by C’s  syntax, is the oldest string formatting and interpolation tool in Python. Here’s a quick example of how you can use this operator to create and process templates:In this example, you have two variables containing data. The first contains a string, and the second holds an integer value. Then, you define a string template using the  and  syntax to define  or . The  means that the first field must be filled with a string, and the  indicates that the field accepts decimal integer values. These are known as conversion types.Finally, you use the  operator to dynamically interpolate the variables’ content into the template and build a new string.This operator also allows you to apply formatting rules to the input values. For example, here’s how you can format currency values:In this example, the template contains the literal dollar sign () to indicate that the formatted value represents a USD amount. The  character is not part of the formatting syntax itself but part of the output.Then, you have a replacement field that starts with the string formatting operator () followed by the string . This string is a  that formats any input number as a floating-point value with a precision of two digits.You can format a string inline using the  operator by passing the values directly. This approach combines the template and the data in a single step, but it doesn’t allow you to reuse the template later on:When you have a complex template, the string formatting operator’s syntax can become cumbersome and hard to read:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Spell Checker-Predicting Correct Word by Editing two time-NLP</title><link>https://dev.to/datatoinfinity/spell-checker-predicting-correct-word-by-editing-two-time-nlp-6gj</link><author>datatoinfinity</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 13:46:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We have already done checking spelling in one way, what I mean by that if spelling have one incorrect character then output will be correct that only.

  Authorization in Production Python: A Deep Dive
In late 2022, a critical bug in our internal data pipeline nearly exposed sensitive customer PII. The root cause wasn’t a vulnerability in the data storage itself, but a flawed authorization check within a custom ETL process. Specifically, a poorly implemented role-based access control (RBAC) system allowed a service account with limited permissions to inadvertently access and process data it shouldn’t have. This incident highlighted a painful truth: authorization isn’t just a “nice-to-have”; it’s a foundational element of any production Python system dealing with sensitive data or critical functionality.  Modern Python ecosystems – cloud-native microservices, data pipelines built with Airflow or Prefect, web APIs using FastAPI or Django, and even machine learning operations – all rely heavily on robust authorization mechanisms.  This post dives deep into the practicalities of building and maintaining these systems.
  
  
  What is "authorization" in Python?
Authorization, in a technical context, is the process of determining  a given subject (user, service account, process) is permitted to do with a resource. It’s distinct from , which verifies  the subject is.  While Python doesn’t have a built-in, standardized authorization framework at the CPython level (no PEP directly addresses this), the ecosystem provides numerous libraries and patterns.  The typing system, particularly with  and , plays a crucial role in defining authorization contracts.  Standard library modules like  (Abstract Base Classes) are often used to define authorization policies as interfaces.  The core principle is to enforce access control  successful authentication.FastAPI Request Handling:  In a REST API, authorization determines if a user can access a specific endpoint or perform a particular action (e.g., ).  We use dependency injection with FastAPI’s security framework to inject authorization logic based on JWT claims.Async Job Queues (Celery/RQ):  When processing tasks asynchronously, authorization ensures that a worker can only execute tasks assigned to its role.  This prevents malicious or misconfigured workers from accessing sensitive data or performing unauthorized operations.  We’ve implemented custom Celery task decorators that check permissions before task execution.Type-Safe Data Models (Pydantic):  Pydantic models can be used to enforce data access restrictions.  For example, a  model might have fields accessible only to administrators.  This is achieved through custom validation logic and property access control.  Command-line interfaces often require authorization to control access to sensitive commands or configuration options.  We use  and custom decorators to implement RBAC for our internal CLI tools.  In machine learning pipelines, authorization controls access to training data and model artifacts.  This prevents unauthorized modification or leakage of sensitive information.  We integrate authorization checks into our feature store access layer.
  
  
  Integration with Python Tooling
Our  reflects our commitment to static analysis and type safety:We leverage ’s strict mode to catch authorization-related type errors early.  Pydantic models are heavily used to define data schemas and enforce validation rules, including authorization constraints.  We use  fixtures to mock authorization services and test different access scenarios.  Runtime hooks, implemented as custom decorators, intercept function calls and enforce authorization policies.  Logging is crucial; we log all authorization attempts (successes and failures) with detailed context.Here's a simplified example of a permission check using a decorator:This demonstrates a simple RBAC pattern.  A more sophisticated system would use a dedicated authorization service (e.g., Open Policy Agent) and a more complex permission model.
  
  
  Failure Scenarios & Debugging
A common failure is incorrect permission evaluation due to logic errors in the authorization code.  We once had a bug where a bitwise AND operation was used instead of a bitwise OR, resulting in overly restrictive permissions.  Debugging involved using  to step through the authorization logic and inspect the permission flags.  Another issue was an async race condition in a Celery worker, where multiple tasks were attempting to access the same resource concurrently without proper locking.  This was identified using  to pinpoint the performance bottleneck and  to trace the execution flow.  Runtime assertions are also critical; we use them to verify that authorization checks are being performed as expected.  Exception traces are invaluable, but they need to be enriched with contextual information (user ID, resource ID, timestamp) to be truly useful.
  
  
  Performance & Scalability
Authorization checks can add significant overhead, especially in high-throughput systems.  We’ve benchmarked different authorization strategies using  and .  Avoiding global state is crucial; caching authorization decisions can improve performance, but requires careful invalidation strategies.  Reducing allocations (e.g., using  instead of regular classes) can also help.  For extremely performance-critical applications, we’ve considered using C extensions to implement authorization logic in C, but this adds complexity and maintenance overhead.  We also leverage database indexing to speed up permission lookups.Insecure deserialization of authorization data (e.g., JWT claims) can lead to code injection or privilege escalation.  We strictly validate all input data and use trusted sources for authorization information.  Improper sandboxing can allow unauthorized access to resources.  We use containerization (Docker) and resource limits to isolate services and prevent privilege escalation.  Regular security audits and penetration testing are essential.We employ a multi-layered testing strategy.  Unit tests verify the correctness of individual authorization functions.  Integration tests ensure that authorization works correctly in the context of the entire system.  Property-based tests (using Hypothesis) generate random inputs to uncover edge cases.   enforces type safety, and  runs all tests with code coverage reporting.  Our CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) includes static analysis, type checking, and automated testing.  We also use pre-commit hooks to enforce code style and prevent common authorization-related errors.
  
  
  Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns
  Makes the system inflexible and difficult to maintain.  Failing to consider the context of the authorization request (e.g., time of day, location).Overly Permissive Defaults:  Granting more permissions than necessary.  Not logging authorization attempts for security and debugging purposes.Mixing Authorization and Business Logic:  Separation of concerns is crucial for maintainability.Relying Solely on Client-Side Authorization:  Always validate permissions on the server-side.
  
  
  Best Practices & Architecture
 Use typing extensively to define authorization contracts.  Isolate authorization logic from business logic.  Validate all input data and handle errors gracefully.  Design authorization components as reusable modules.  Use configuration files to manage permissions and roles.  Inject authorization services into components that require them.  Automate testing, deployment, and monitoring.  Ensure that builds are consistent and reliable.  Document the authorization architecture and policies.Mastering authorization is paramount for building robust, scalable, and maintainable Python systems.  The incident in 2022 served as a stark reminder of the consequences of neglecting this critical aspect of software development.  Refactor legacy code to incorporate proper authorization checks, measure performance to identify bottlenecks, write comprehensive tests, and enforce linters and type gates.  Investing in authorization upfront will save you significant headaches – and potential data breaches – down the road.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Spell Checker-Predicting Correct Word-NLP-Part 1</title><link>https://dev.to/datatoinfinity/spell-checker-predicting-correct-word-nlp-part-1-5g3f</link><author>datatoinfinity</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 12:23:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ might return: , , ..., , , ...,  (104 total) might return: , , , ... might return: ,  might return: , , ..., ,  (130 total)Then the combined  removes overlaps.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Top Industries Benefiting from Partnering with an Enterprise AI Development Company</title><link>https://dev.to/sparkout/top-industries-benefiting-from-partnering-with-an-enterprise-ai-development-company-25mg</link><author>AI Development Company</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 12:06:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence has transformed it from a futuristic concept into an indispensable strategic asset for businesses across the globe.

The allure of enhancing customer service, streamlining operations, and driving sales with intelligent automation is undeniable. However, a crucial fork in the road often appears: should you embark on building an AI chatbot in-house, or is partnering with a specialized AI Chatbot Development Company the smarter move? This isn't just a technical decision; it's a strategic one with significant implications for your Return on Investment (ROI).While the "do-it-yourself" (DIY) approach might initially seem more cost-effective due to avoiding external vendor fees, the reality is often far more complex. Understanding the true costs and benefits of each path is essential for making an informed choice that truly delivers value.The Allure and Hidden Pitfalls of DIY Bot Development
The appeal of developing a chatbot in-house is clear. You might have an existing IT team, access to various no-code or low-code platforms, and the desire for complete control over the development process. This can feel like a way to save money and ensure the bot aligns perfectly with your internal vision.However, the "savings" often mask significant hidden costs and limitations:Lack of Specialized Expertise: Building an effective AI chatbot requires a very specific skill set: natural language processing (NLP) engineers, data scientists, conversational designers, and AI ethicists. Most internal IT teams, while highly capable, lack this specialized depth. Training existing staff can be time-consuming and expensive, diverting them from their core responsibilities.Limited Capabilities and Performance: DIY bots, especially those built on basic no-code platforms, often struggle with complex queries, understanding nuance, or maintaining context across conversations. They might be able to handle simple FAQs, but they quickly hit a wall when faced with dynamic or intricate user interactions. This leads to frustrated users and a high rate of escalation to human agents, negating efficiency gains.Suboptimal User Experience: Without expert conversational design, DIY bots can sound robotic, repetitive, or fail to understand user intent accurately. A clunky, frustrating chatbot experience can actively damage your brand reputation and drive customers away, eroding trust rather than building it.Scalability Challenges: As your business grows or customer inquiries increase, a hastily built DIY bot can buckle under pressure. Scaling an in-house solution to handle higher volumes or new features can become a massive technical undertaking, requiring significant unplanned resources.Ongoing Maintenance and Updates: AI models require continuous monitoring, retraining with new data, and performance optimization to remain effective. Keeping up with evolving user language, new product offerings, and emerging AI technologies is a full-time job. An internal team might struggle to dedicate the necessary continuous effort, leading to bot decay and diminished performance over time.Security and Compliance Risks: Handling customer data, especially sensitive information, demands stringent security protocols and adherence to regulations like GDPR or HIPAA. Without dedicated expertise in secure AI development, DIY bots can inadvertently introduce significant vulnerabilities, leading to data breaches and costly legal repercussions.The Strategic Advantages of Partnering with an AI Chatbot Development Company

With assets under management (AUM) surpassing $9 trillion as of 2023, BlackRock’s influence extends across a wide range of investment sectors, from equities and fixed income to alternative assets and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing. This article explores the investment strategies and management techniques that have propelled BlackRock to its position as a dominant force in asset management.
The Rise of BlackRock: A Brief History
BlackRock was founded in 1988 by a group of eight partners, including current CEO Larry Fink. Initially focused on risk management and fixed-income products, the firm quickly gained a reputation for its analytical rigor and innovative approach to investing. BlackRock’s early success was largely due to its pioneering use of technology and data analytics to manage risk, which set it apart from competitors.
In 1999, BlackRock went public, marking a significant milestone in its growth trajectory. Over the next two decades, the firm expanded its product offerings and global presence through a series of strategic acquisitions, including the purchase of Merrill Lynch Investment Management in 2006 and Barclays Global Investors (BGI) in 2009. The acquisition of BGI, which included the iShares exchange-traded funds (ETF) business, was particularly transformative, catapulting BlackRock into the forefront of the global ETF market.
Investment Strategies That Define BlackRockAt the core of BlackRock’s success is its diversified approach to asset management. The firm offers a broad range of investment products and services designed to meet the needs of institutional and retail investors alike. These products span the investment spectrum, including actively managed funds, index funds, ETFs, and alternative investments.
One of BlackRock’s most notable strategies is its emphasis on long-term, value-driven investing. The firm’s investment philosophy is grounded in the belief that markets are generally efficient, but that opportunities for excess returns exist in certain areas. BlackRock’s portfolio managers are encouraged to take a long-term perspective, focusing on fundamental analysis and valuation to identify mispriced assets.
This value-driven approach is complemented by BlackRock’s focus on risk management. The firm’s roots in risk management are evident in its rigorous analytical processes, which involve the use of advanced data analytics and proprietary models to assess and manage risk across portfolios. This focus on risk management has been a key factor in BlackRock’s ability to deliver consistent returns for its clients, even in volatile market environments.
The Power of Technology: Aladdin and Beyond
A key differentiator for BlackRock is its integration of technology into its investment processes. The firm’s proprietary risk management platform, Aladdin, is widely regarded as one of the most advanced systems in the industry. Aladdin serves as the backbone of BlackRock’s investment operations, providing real-time data and analytics to portfolio managers, risk managers, and clients.
Aladdin’s capabilities extend beyond risk management to include portfolio construction, trading, compliance, and reporting. The platform’s ability to aggregate and analyze vast amounts of data gives BlackRock a significant edge in identifying trends, managing risks, and optimizing portfolios. This technological advantage has been instrumental in BlackRock’s growth and success, enabling the firm to scale its operations and manage an increasingly complex array of assets.
In addition to Aladdin, BlackRock has continued to invest in technology to enhance its investment capabilities. The firm’s focus on digital transformation is evident in its efforts to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning into its investment processes. These technologies are being used to improve portfolio optimization, enhance risk management, and identify new investment opportunities.
ESG Investing: Leading the ChargeIn recent years, BlackRock has emerged as a leader in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing, a trend that reflects growing demand from investors for sustainable investment options. Under the leadership of Larry Fink, BlackRock has made ESG considerations a central component of its investment strategy, arguing that companies with strong ESG practices are better positioned for long-term success.
In his annual letters to CEOs, Fink has consistently emphasized the importance of sustainability and corporate responsibility. BlackRock has integrated ESG factors into its investment processes across its entire product lineup, from actively managed funds to index funds and ETFs. The firm has also launched a range of ESG-focused products, including the iShares Sustainable ETF suite, which offers investors exposure to companies with strong ESG profiles.
BlackRock’s commitment to ESG investing is backed by its stewardship efforts. The firm engages with the companies in which it invests to promote best practices in governance, environmental sustainability, and social responsibility. This engagement is supported by BlackRock’s voting power as a major shareholder, allowing it to influence corporate behavior on a global scale.
The Rise of Index Investing and ETFs
BlackRock’s acquisition of Barclays Global Investors in 2009 marked a turning point in the firm’s history, particularly with the addition of the iShares ETF business. iShares has since become the largest ETF provider in the world, with a market share of over 40%. The rise of ETFs has been a significant driver of BlackRock’s growth, as investors increasingly favor low-cost, passive investment vehicles over traditional actively managed funds.
The appeal of ETFs lies in their ability to offer diversified exposure to a wide range of asset classes, sectors, and geographies at a lower cost than traditional mutual funds. BlackRock’s dominance in the ETF market is due in part to its ability to offer a broad array of products that meet the needs of different types of investors, from institutional clients to individual investors.
BlackRock has also been at the forefront of innovation in the ETF space. The firm has introduced a range of innovative products, such as smart beta ETFs, which use alternative weighting methodologies to capture specific investment factors like value, momentum, or volatility. These products offer investors a way to achieve targeted exposure to specific investment themes while maintaining the benefits of passive investing.
Global Reach and Client Focus

That post set the stage for developers and testers who wanted to begin their journey into automation, but it was just the beginning.As more development teams integrate quality earlier in the SDLC, there's increasing demand for professionals who can not only write clean Python code but also automate real-world scenarios on web applications. That’s where Selenium with Python comes in. This article is a step-by-step guide for those looking to connect their Python skills with browser-based automation, starting from scratch and growing toward building robust automation suites.If you're a Python developer exploring QA responsibilities or a QA engineer wanting to strengthen your Python automation foundation, this is for you.
  
  
  What Is Selenium, and Why Pair It with Python?
Selenium is the de facto standard for browser automation. It allows you to simulate everything a real user would do on a website—clicking, typing, scrolling, verifying content, navigating tabs, and more. Selenium WebDriver directly controls browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, making it perfect for testing across environments.
  
  
  Why Python for Selenium Automation?
Python stands out for a few key reasons:Concise syntax: Short, readable scripts allow teams to iterate faster.Powerful ecosystem: Integration with pytest, unittest, pandas, requests, and faker makes Python automation extremely flexible.Beginner-friendly: New testers and developers can quickly start coding without excessive boilerplate.Together, Selenium and Python form a fast, maintainable, and extensible way to automate your testing process, without steep learning curves.
  
  
  Step 1: Setting Up Selenium with Python
Before you write a single test case, set up your Python + Selenium environment:1. Install Selenium via pip:
pip install selenium2. Download the Chrome WebDriver:Once setup is done, you’re ready to write your first browser automation script.
  
  
  Step 2: Writing a Basic Selenium Test Script in Python
Let’s create a simple automated test: open Google, perform a search, and close the browser.from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keysdriver = webdriver.Chrome()search_box = driver.find_element("name", "q")search_box.send_keys("Selenium automation with Python")
search_box.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)driver.implicitly_wait(5)
driver.quit()Opened a browser and navigated to a URLFound a search input element using the name locatorTyped a query and submitted itWaited for results and closed the sessionThis is your first successful test of a working UI automation flow!
  
  
  Step 3: Locating and Interacting with Web Elements
Selenium allows you to find and interact with web elements using multiple strategies. Some commonly used methods include:from selenium.webdriver.common.by import Byemail_input = driver.find_element(By.ID, "email")
email_input.send_keys("test@example.com")You can also perform advanced actions like:These interactions simulate actual user behavior, helping you verify UI flows more reliably.
  
  
  Step 4: Dealing with Waits – The Right Way
Web apps are dynamic, and elements don’t always load instantly. Without waits, your test may fail because the element wasn’t there—yet.Implicit Wait:
Applies globally:driver.implicitly_wait(10)  # SecondsExplicit Wait:
Targeted, preferred in modern test scripts:from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as ECelement = WebDriverWait(driver, 15).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, "username"))Use explicit waits when you need to validate specific states like visibility, presence, or clickability.
  
  
  Step 5: Managing Dynamic Test Data
Hardcoded values might work in small tests, but for scalable automation, parameterized, random, or external test data is essential.CSV or Excel files (via pandas)JSON files for structured test casesData generation libraries like fakerfake = Faker()
print(fake.name())        # Random full name
print(fake.email())       # Random email addressThis reduces repetition and improves test realism—especially in sign-up or form automation.
  
  
  Step 6: Structuring and Scaling Your Test Suite
As your test cases grow, proper structuring becomes critical. Key practices include:Using pytest for test discovery, grouping, and fixturesModularizing test logic into reusable functionsSeparating page locators using Page Object Model (POM)Externalizing configuration (URLs, credentials, etc.)Sample test file structure:tests/
  test_login.py
pages/
  signup_page.py
  data_generator.py
  
  
  Final Thoughts: Python + Selenium Is Just the Beginning
Selenium with Python gives you direct control over browser-based tests, helping you ensure real user experiences are not just functional, but consistent across deployments.Whether you're building a test suite from scratch or integrating with CI/CD platforms like Jenkins or GitHub Actions—Python provides the flexibility and readability to scale your automation goals effectively.Need Help Scaling Your Python Test Automation?

Similarly, web apps need a clear structure to stay organized and maintainable. This is where architectural patterns like MVC and MVT come in!Django, a popular Python framework, follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) pattern.Beginners often confuse MVT with the traditional Model-View-Controller (MVC).This article will clarify the differences and explain Django’s unique approach.MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, a software design pattern that separates an application into three main components:1.Model: Handles data and business logic2.View: Handles display and user interface3.Controller: Handles user input and mediates between Model and ViewHow Django Implements This PatternLet’s break it down with a blog website example:A visitor clicks "View Post" on /post/1.Receives the request: "Show me Post ID 1".Asks the Model to fetch the data.Talks to the database: .Returns the post data (title, content, author).Passes the data to the View.Renders an HTML template with the post data.MVC in Popular FrameworksFramework   Language    MVC Implementation
Ruby on Rails   Ruby    Controllers (*.rb), Views (*.erb), Models (ActiveRecord)
Laravel PHP UserController.php, User.php (Model), Blade templates
ASP.NET MVC C#  UserController.cs, User.cs, Razor Views
Django (MVT)    Python  views.py (Controller), models.py, Templates

  ├── controllers/     # Controller (UsersController.rb)
  └── views/           # View (users/index.html.erb)
What is MVT Architecture?Let me dive deeper into Django's Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture to give you a comprehensive understanding in this article.View (Django's "Controller")Template (Django's "View")Key Differences: MVC vs. MVTComponent   Traditional MVC       Django’s MVT
Logic        Controller           View
UI           View                 Template
Data         Model                 Model
Routing      Part of Controller     URL Dispatcher
Final Verdict: MVC vs. Django’s MVTBoth MVC (Model-View-Controller) and MVT (Model-View-Template) are architectural patterns designed to organize code for maintainability and scalability.

Or seen a piece of writing generated by AI that’s almost indistinguishable from something written by a person? These experiences are becoming increasingly common thanks to Large Language Models (LLMs). But what exactly  these powerful tools, and what does their rise mean for the future?LLMs are sophisticated computer programs designed to understand and generate human language. Think of them as incredibly advanced autocomplete systems, but on a massive scale. Instead of suggesting the next word in a sentence, they can generate entire paragraphs, essays, even poems, based on the input they receive. This ability stems from their “training” on massive datasets of text and code – think of it as reading every book, article, and website ever written. This massive exposure allows them to learn patterns, relationships between words, and the nuances of human language.Imagine teaching a child to write by showing them countless examples of well-written stories. Eventually, the child learns the rules of grammar, sentence structure, and even develops a unique writing style. LLMs work similarly, but at a scale unimaginable to human learning. They analyze billions of words, identifying statistical probabilities of word combinations and contextual relationships. This enables them to predict the most likely next word, sentence, or paragraph in response to a given prompt.The significance of LLMs cannot be overstated. They represent a leap forward in artificial intelligence, pushing the boundaries of what computers can achieve in understanding and generating human-quality text. This has far-reaching implications across numerous fields. They address problems like the need for efficient content creation, accurate translation, and personalized learning experiences, while also opening up opportunities for innovation we are only beginning to understand.Applications and Transformative Impact:The applications of LLMs are already vast and rapidly expanding. Here are a few key examples: LLMs can generate various forms of content, including articles, marketing copy, scripts, and even creative writing. This can significantly increase efficiency for businesses and individuals, streamlining content production and potentially reducing costs. LLMs excel at translating text between languages, offering more accurate and nuanced translations than previous methods. This can break down communication barriers and facilitate global collaboration.  AI-powered chatbots driven by LLMs provide instant customer support, answering frequently asked questions and resolving basic issues, freeing up human agents to handle more complex problems. LLMs can personalize learning experiences by generating customized exercises, quizzes, and feedback for students.  They can also help create educational content in various formats. LLMs can assist programmers by generating code snippets, suggesting improvements, and even helping to debug existing code, increasing development speed and efficiency. LLMs can analyze medical texts, assist in diagnosis, and even help develop new treatments by identifying patterns and relationships in vast datasets.Challenges, Limitations, and Ethical Considerations:Despite their potential, LLMs are not without limitations and challenges: LLMs are trained on existing data, which may reflect societal biases.  This can lead to the generation of biased or discriminatory outputs, requiring careful monitoring and mitigation strategies. LLMs can sometimes generate incorrect or nonsensical information, a phenomenon known as “hallucination.”  Their outputs should always be critically evaluated and verified. The potential misuse of LLMs for malicious purposes, such as generating fake news or impersonating individuals, raises serious ethical concerns.  Robust safeguards and regulations are crucial to prevent such misuse. The training of LLMs requires significant computational resources, leading to a substantial carbon footprint.  Developing more energy-efficient training methods is essential.  The automation potential of LLMs raises concerns about job displacement in certain sectors.  Addressing this requires proactive measures like retraining and upskilling initiatives.Large Language Models represent a powerful and transformative technology with the potential to reshape numerous aspects of our lives. While challenges remain, ongoing research and development are actively addressing issues related to bias, accuracy, and ethical implications. As LLMs continue to evolve, we can expect even more sophisticated and impactful applications, further blurring the lines between human and machine intelligence. The key lies in responsible development, deployment, and regulation to ensure these powerful tools benefit humanity as a whole. The future of LLMs is not just about technological advancement; it's about navigating the ethical and societal implications to harness their potential for good.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ANN</title><link>https://dev.to/docmath/ann-5b8g</link><author>Dr. Mathews K.

How does a computer understand instructions written with all those functions, lists, and other components?In this blog post — just to make things fun and more memorable — we’ll explore how Python code is run through an analogy of a chef trying to cook a dish from a recipe written in a foreign language.Before we dive in, it is important to note that unlike Python, a lot of programming languages like C++ and Java use . Compilers convert the code written in their respective languages to machine-level , allowing any computer to run them.However, Python takes a different approach involving an interpreter, bytecode, and PVM (Python Virtual Machine).An interpreter works kind of like a compiler, but instead of converting the  code into binary, it translates it to something called , which is saved as a  file in the  folder.🧑‍🍳
We can think of an interpreter as a translator who converts the recipe from a foreign language to visuals, and those visuals as the bytecode. Visuals are not the final dish, but they are something the chef can work with.
  
  
  What is a PVM (Python Virtual Machine)?
Since Bytecode is a language in between normal Python code and machine code, we need a special tool to execute it. This is where the Python Virtual Machine (PVM) comes in.The PVM reads the bytecode and executes the written instructions line-by-line. It is responsible for executing loops, logic statements, etc. — all during runtime.🧑‍🍳
The PVM is the chef who can understand the visual instructions (bytecode) and cook the dish as requested. The chef doesn’t involve with the original recipe ( file) — they just follow the translated instructions.Here is a diagram that sums up the whole process (with the analogy):]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Python⇒Speed: 500× faster: Four different ways to speed up your code</title><link>https://pythonspeed.com/articles/different-ways-speed/</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If your Python code is slow and needs to be , there are many

  There will be a YouTube video recording available at a later date.
  This talk was given as the Security-Developer-in-Residence at the Python Software Foundation,
  a role which is sponsored by Alpha-Omega. Thanks to Alpha-Omega for supporting security in the Python ecosystem.To understand why security is special, we have to take a look at why open source is an amazing thing.
For many components of open source, users that have the time, desire, and expertise are able to contribute meaningfully to projects.
As a maintainer of an open source project, Users and contributors can work on the areas they are interested in, like triaging bug reports, engaging with the community, or writing great docs.
For smaller open source projects this is especially important, there’s only one or a few maintainers and they can’t do it all on their own sustainably.But not for security, right? Security is .Only a select few are supposed to be able to handle vulnerability reports, configure the repository and package manager settings, and secure the release process.
This tight association between security work and maintainers is what I’d like to try to pull apart today.Maintainers, especially for smaller projects, are almost always experts in the , not necessarily in .
But the expectations of open source projects means that maintainers feel compelled to do this work to keep their project and users safe.And those expectations for security today, that security work is done by few rather than many, combined with the secretive nature of security work means that maintainers often feel isolated.Maintainers don’t see how other projects are triaging vulnerabilities and can’t learn from each other. They can’t compare notes on what they are seeing and whether they are doing the right thing.
Isolation in security work breeds a culture of fear. Fear of doing the wrong thing and making your users unsafe.This private conversation was published with permission from Marcelo, maintainer of Starlette, a popular Python library that powers FastAPI.He was seeing security reports that seemed convincing but they were also confusing. He asked for my help and together we determined the reports were generated with an LLM and were meaningless. I later published an article about “slop security reports” that other projects were seeing too, including curl, Python, Django, and others. But none of us would know what the others were seeing without sharing.Smaller projects are shaped by their tools, not the other way around.
Small projects don’t have the time and resources to make a square peg fit into a circular hole when it comes to any type of tooling, including security.
They don’t have time to create bots and wrappers and bend these tools to work for them, like many larger projects do.This means that whatever is available or the default experience is probably what they work with, and often our tools encode the assumption that “only maintainers do security work”.Of the top 10,000 open source packages with GitHub repositories identified by Ecosystems dataset, 35% are owned by a GitHub user, not a GitHub organization.
This has huge implications for what features are available to those projects and who is able to do security work at all.Security tools and vulnerability reports often introduce an asymmetry by creating work to do without resolving the issues identified.
Fixing security issues while weighing user expectations, performance, and backwards compatibility is a tough job.
This is the reason maintainers are often hesitant to adopt security scanners and tools, because adoption is easy but being on the hook to triage the findings forever is hard.If a bunch of your limited time with a project is spent doing work that isn’t aligned with your interests in the project, this can lead to burnout which only makes the problem worse.This image is from the changelog of libexpat which states that the project is understaffed and without funding and is in need of help responding to findings from fuzzing the project within the standard 90 day grace period.So what can we all do to make security work less “special” and more like other open source contributions?I propose a new model for open source security contributions, where security work is completed by trusted individuals that aren’t necessarily maintainers on behalf of projects.
This model break the assumption that maintainers are the only ones that can do security work, especially for smaller projects.These “security contributors” could be maintainers or contributors of other open source projects that know about security, they could be foundations offering up resources to their ecosystem, or engineers at companies helping their dependency graph.Even if you’re not contributing security work directly to an open source project, I think there’s reframing, re-engineering, and rethinking work that we can all do to make this model successful.Now I know what you might be thinking: “What about XZ?”
XZ often comes up during conversations involving trust in contributors to open source projects, but I’m not convinced it’s the show-stopper it’s often portrayed as.The technologies to discover the backdoor trigger of XZ already exist but had not yet been adopted by the project, such as reproducible builds, build provenance, capability analysis, or using a canonical URL to download source code.Malicious contributors have always been a problem for open source and the solution can’t be that we just stop trusting each other or accepting help from our community.
We lose something bigger than the XZ-utils backdoor if we let this incident define how open source security works going forward.We have to be able to build trust amongst contributors and projects and security work can’t all fall on maintainers.
If we want open source sustainability then we cannot let XZ-utils define open source security.So what can we all do to nurture this more sustainable model of open source security contribution?We can all use our voices and experiences to build a more positive and healthy security culture and overcome the isolation inherent to security work.Sharing and encouraging the sharing experiences shows others that they’re not the only ones that think this is difficult.
Seeing others sharing experiences shows that it’s okay to ask for help and to not be perfect, instead the focus should be on always improving.If you’re a public contributor to open source security, making yourself visible and approachable is a great way to begin building trust in the communities you participate in.
Conferences and in-person meetups are excellent venues for promoting positive security culture and building trust amongst a community.There is something about being in-person that really let’s people be vulnerable and talk honestly about what they are experiencing and their problems which sometimes is exactly what we need to hear.
When I’m at conferences I also like to offer up 1-on-1 time to discuss security issues with maintainers or help them adopt new security features.TLS and public key infrastructure scale trust of the internet and web, we need more technologies that scale trust in open source contributions.We should continue contributing to and adopting technologies that enable trust for open source projects and contributions.
This is especially meaningful when the technology is added to existing tooling like package managers and build tools.
Technologies like build reproducibility, build provenance, and capability analysis can all minimize the risk from adding more privileged contributors.We  need platforms and tools to update their underlying assumptions about who does security work for projects to support this new open source security contribution model.Separating maintenance responsibilities and security work is beneficial for users wanting to help projects, too.
If we assume that the securing and maintaining are linked, then it becomes a more difficult task to be able to offer help to open source projects.
Some projects do not have the governance in place to transition from one to many maintainers. Some maintainers want to continue owning the project roadmap and vision.Getting your manager on-board with you maintaining a project is a difficult and amorphous ask compared to more tightly defined “security work” for an open source dependency your team uses.
Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) could use this model to concretely show how they are benefiting their whole open source supply-chain, and not only the larger projects that are able to receive grant funding.I don’t think this change happens overnight, but we need to think about where we might go.
From my experience working in open source, security work isn’t the special sauce, it’s always trust.Whether you’re an open source user, a contributor to OpenSSF or other security working groups, or a developer of tools for open source projects, I hope I’ve inspired you that we need to think beyond current models of how security work is done for open source projects to achieve sustainable open source security.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I have included the Experimental Results section to strengthen the algorithm’s empirical validation.

Testing against resources deployed in the cloud isn’t free.Secondly, an active & reliable internet connection is required, it’s not ideal to have your tests bound to the internet. You might find yourself at a conference with slow and limited wifi connectivity or a space with public wifi that shouldn’t be trusted. You could be on a plane or train, you might even find yourself in a remote area.Mocking allows you to run tests locally without incurring additional costs. Everyone loves to save money after all.
  
  
  Setting Up Your Test Environment
Some preparation is required to ensure we can run our tests, we need a way for our tests to import modules that we have written as well as letting  know where these files are located.This can be achieved by creating a  file as well as a  file. file gets the absolute path of the project root directory. file sets the path for our app, test paths and silences a deprecation warning for .Create these files at your project’s root:
  
  
  Your First Test: The Root Endpoint
Create a directory that will be a home for our , name it tests and within this directory create a file named .Let’s create a test for our root endpoint, add the following imports at the top of the file:Create a  object and pass  as an argument, add a test function named , see below for the complete code snippet:Run pytest test_player.py::test_root in the terminal window. The test should pass.We will use  to provide a defined, reliable and consistent context for our tests. This will include player data, mocked AWS credentials for moto and our mock DynamoDB table.Let’s add a couple of fixtures to our code, we will start with creating a fixture that contains a single player’s data, add this code directly below the  object we created earlier:Now we need to take a similar approach for representing all players, however creating a function with all this data will make the code long, a better approach would be to create a separate json file and load the data when the function is called.Create a file named  in the  directory and populate it with the below:Add the below code to create a fixture that will load the all players data from the json file when the function is called:
  
  
  Mocking AWS credentials and DynamoDB service
Create a fixture that will mock AWS credentials for below by adding the below code:The mocked AWS credentials will be used as an argument for our mock DynamoDB table, add the below code to create another fixture for mocking the AWS DynamoDB service:With all the fixtures created, we are now at a stage that we can begin testing the other endpoints that would normally interact with AWS services, albeit mocked in nature.We can create a test that will create and return the player data, this function takes in the  and  fixtures we created earlier as arguments, add the below code:Run pytest test_player.py::test_create_and_get_player, this test too shall pass.Onto the next endpoint, lets test if we can get all players, this will be achieved by loading the players data from a json file and asserting that players names are found and if a certain player is not found.Run pytest test_player.py::test_get_all_playersWe’re on a roll with tests that are passing at this stage, lets test the endpoint for updating a player details, the player in question is , he will be transferring to  and will take up the number 10 jersey.Run pytest test_player.py::test_update_playerNow let’s create a test for removing a player.Run pytest test_player.py::test_delete_playerThe final test is an edge case, lets create a test when removing a non existent player, an error 404 should be returned since the player does not exist.Run pytest test_player.py::test_delete_non_existent_player: Locking down your Lambda Function URL because security isn’t optional. Stay tuned. ⚡️🔐I’ll cover that in a future post.

While Python’s for loops don’t require a separate counter by default, there are times when we need both the item and its index.That’s where Python’s built-in enumerate() function comes in. It simplifies looping by giving you the index and the element in a clean and Pythonic way.**
The enumerate() function adds a counter to an iterable and returns it as an enumerate object. You can use it directly in a for loop to access both the index and the value of each element.enumerate(iterable, start=0)
words = ['apple', 'boy', 'cat', 'dog', 'egg', 'fish']
 for i, word in enumerate(words):
Output:You get both the index and the item — no need for range() or manually tracking the index.
The Old Way: Without enumerate()
You might be doing something like this:for i in range(len(words)):
    print(i, words[i])
or even:index = 0
 for word in words:
     index += 1
Both approaches work, but they are longer, messier, and less readable.
Makes your loop cleaner and more readable
Eliminates the need for range(len(...))
Removes manual index tracking.
Tracking line numbers while reading a file
Displaying quiz options or menu items
Debugging: print index with values
Displaying numbered data in terminal apps
enumerate() is one of those small but powerful tools in Python that makes a big difference in how clean and elegant your code looks.
It’s a must-know for any beginner, and a great habit for writing better loops.Next time you reach for range(len(...)), consider using enumerate() instead.

Let’s get into it!The MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern is a software architectural pattern that separates application logic into three interconnected components: The part that handles the . It defines how data is stored, retrieved, and manipulated — usually tied to a database. The  or representation layer. It presents the data to the user. The  that handles user input, updates the model, and decides which view to show.This separation makes applications easier to scale and maintain.
  
  
  Here's a visual breakdown:
MVC is widely used in frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Laravel (PHP), and ASP.NET.
  
  
  Enter Django: The MVT Way
Django follows the  architectural pattern, which is a variation of the traditional  design pattern used in web development. This pattern separates the application into three main components: Manages the data — built using Django’s ORM. Defines the structure of your database.View (different from MVC): In Django, the “View” contains the . It fetches data from the model and passes it to the template. Responsible for rendering the final  — your front-end content.Now here’s the diffrence:In Django, the "View" from MVC is called the "Template", and the "Controller" role is handled by the Django framework itself.So Django's View is actually the Controller in traditional MVC!
  
  
  here is the visual breakdown

  
  
  🔁 Side-by-Side: MVC vs MVT

  
  
  here is the visual breakdown!
So Django automates a lot of what traditional MVC expects you to write manually. 
  
  
  🛠️ Example: A Simple Blog
Let’s say we’re building a blog:
{% for post in posts %}
  {{ post.title }}{{ post.content }}{{ post.date_posted }}
{% endfor %}
This is the heart of Django’s MVT — clean separation, yet tightly integrated by Django’s robust request handling. You work on templates separately from the business logic and data models. The model definitions give you an auto-generated backend. The architecture supports large projects out-of-the-box. You can go from idea to MVP in record time.By understanding how MVT maps to traditional MVC, you'll appreciate Django’s design even more. It's MVC with a twist — and that twist is what makes Django so .

  🎉 Welcome to Day 5 of Django Journey!
Today, we break down the architecture that powers Django apps — the  pattern — and compare it to the classic . If you've heard about , , , and got confused, you're not alone! Let’s untangle that web. 🕸️
  
  
  🧠 MVC vs MVT — What’s the Difference?
Before diving into Django specifics, let’s explore what these patterns mean.
  
  
  🧩 MVC (Model-View-Controller)
This pattern separates your application into: – The data and database layer. – The UI or frontend display. – The logic that controls data flow between the Model and View.Used in frameworks like Laravel, Ruby on Rails, and ASP.NET.
  
  
  🧩 MVT (Model-View-Template) in Django
Django follows MVT, which looks very similar: – Represents data (just like MVC). – Handles logic and pulls data from the model. – The HTML interface shown to users.In Django, the View is like the Controller in MVC, and the Template acts as the View.
  
  
  🏗️ Let’s Understand Each MVT Component

  
  
  🔹 1. Model – Your Data's Structure
The Model defines how data is stored in the database using Django’s ORM (Object Relational Mapping). It avoids writing raw SQL.Models map directly to database tables.Each class = 1 table, each field = 1 column.The View is the middleman. It receives user requests, talks to the model, then selects the template to display.python
def home(request):
    posts = BlogPost.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'home.html', {'posts': posts})Think of Views as your app’s .It returns a response, usually HTML.
  
  
  🔹 3. Template – The Frontend
Templates are what users see — HTML files with dynamic placeholders.html
{% for post in posts %}
  <h2>{{ post.title }}</h2>
  <p>{{ post.content|truncatewords:20 }}</p>Templates use Django Template Language (DTL).They display data passed by the view.Django uses a URL dispatcher to connect browser paths to views.python
path('', views.home, name='home')

  URLConf (urls.py)
     View (views.py)
   Model (if needed)
  Template (HTML page)
Browser Response

Maybe it didn’t break your program, but it’s not good practice. Leaving files or network connections open can cause resource leaks, meaning you’re using up system memory or leaving a file locked unnecessarily. That’s where context managers come in. They handle the “setup and teardown” automatically so you can focus on your logic without worrying about the cleanup.This blog will guide you through:What a context manager isHow  and  workReal-life use cases and examplesHow to write your own context managers both class-based and function-based
  
  
  What Is a Context Manager?
A context manager is a Python object that properly manages resources like files, network connections, or database sessions. It makes sure things are set up when you enter a block of code and cleaned up when you leave it, even if something goes wrong.You’ve already used one before:What this does behind the scenes:Python calls , then It runs your  inside the  blockWhen the block is done or crashes, it calls  to close the fileYou didn’t have to write a / block. Python cleaned up for you.
  
  
  The  and  Methods
To create a context manager yourself, you need a class that defines two special methods:Let’s see this in action with a simple logger.
  
  
  Example 1: A Simple Logging Context Manager
Starting the timer...
Elapsed time: 1.50 seconds
Even if there’s an error inside the block,  still runs which is great for cleanup.Let’s take this a bit further. Here are some practical real-world problems you can solve with custom context managers.
  
  
  1. Automatically Closing ResourcesImagine you're working with file handles, network sockets, or database connections. You need to ensure they're closed no matter what happens.2. Temporarily Change Working DirectoryYou might want to run a script in a different folder temporarily and go back automatically.It cleanly returns you to your original path. Great for file-heavy automation scripts.
  
  
  3. Thread Locking in MultithreadingWorking with ?The lock is automatically released after the block.
  
  
  4. Suppressing Output TemporarilySometimes you use a noisy library that prints too much. You can silence it:This is handy when running external tools or verbose APIs.Want to retry a risky operation automatically?You just built a mini fault-tolerant system!Context managers are one of Python’s most powerful but underused features. Once you start using them, you'll find dozens of places where they clean up your code and prevent bugs especially around resources, cleanup, and state changes.You need something to be cleaned up after useYou're dealing with files, sockets, locks, or temporary stateYou want readable and bug-resistant codeStart small. Try writing one or two yourself. You’ll see how easy and useful they really are.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Use Vibe Coding Without Making a Mess (And What I Learned Along the Way)</title><link>https://dev.to/urielcuriel_41/how-to-use-vibe-coding-without-making-a-mess-and-what-i-learned-along-the-way-230m</link><author>Uriel Curiel</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 16:15:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ is everywhere lately—mostly as a meme or criticism aimed at people trying to build software without really knowing how to code, or at replacing developers with AI.

It was me, thinking in TypeScript while coding in Python.In this post, I want to share how I went from a vibe-coded AI-generated PoC full of forced ideas to a robust, clean and 20x faster solution. Not to convince you to use AI, but to show how you can actually benefit from it without forgetting good design principles.
  
  
  From a Proof of Concept to a working idea (with GitHub Copilot)
Before I sit down and start writing code for hours straight, I prefer to plan what I want to build using Design Docs (if you want me to write about that, let me know in the comments). So I started thinking about the architecture I’d need to solve my problem: a way to parse semantic chunks from large documents to improve context and accuracy in RAGs.Once I had the architecture, I started asking Copilot to write different parts of it. And here’s where I made my first conceptual mistake: I was thinking in TypeScript, not in a “pythonic” way.I’ve been using Nest.js for years, and it got me used to a specific and powerful way of building apps, where it’s common to define logic and metadata using . My plan, described in the Design Doc, followed that philosophy:Node definitions with class and property decorators:
I imagined classes for each node type (like Rule, Article, Paragraph) and decorators like  or  on properties.A centralized and smart TreeBuilder:
It would introspect the classes, read the decorators and metadata, and build the tree.Inheritance only for nesting, not behavior:
The main logic lived inside the TreeBuilder, not in the nodes themselves.With this TypeScript-style mindset, the AI was the perfect coding buddy. Like a junior developer with a lot of knowledge but no judgment, it did exactly what I asked: metaclasses, introspection, magic.  And yeah, the code worked. It met all the requirements from the Design Doc. The PoC was a success. But the code felt messy and overengineered. It looked like a TypeScript project wearing Python syntax.
  
  
  Refactoring with real software engineering: from “what” to idiomatic “how”
This is where the real engineering starts. With the PoC validated, I went back to the Design Doc—not to change the goal, but to rethink the implementation.The code was the result of asking for a “translation” of a pattern, instead of asking for a “pythonic” solution. So I decided to refactor it. This time, I was the architect, and the AI was just my assistant.Replace decorators and metaclasses with basic inheritance.Use  for data-only structures.Remove the central builder logic and let each class build itself.I still used the AI, but now with more precise instructions:,” “Suggest a method for the base class,” and so on.
  
  
  The measurable impact of simplicity
After refactoring, I wrote performance tests using a big and complex document to compare both versions. And the results were clear:Refactored (Human-AI guided)The new version wasn’t just faster—it was also smarter, more readable, and easier to maintain. All because I chose simplicity and good design.
  
  
  Final thoughts: our role in the  era
This project taught me something important:  with AI is amazing for quick prototyping. It lets us explore ideas fast.  But when the code “works,” that’s where our real job starts.AI is not a threat for devs who understand software engineering principles. It’s a tool. The best assistant we’ve ever had. Our future is not about being replaced, but about becoming better architects, better guides, and better software crafters.Have you been through something similar using AI to code?

For the first time, I clearly understood how Django’s MVT (Model–View–Template) compares to the more commonly discussed MVC (Model–View–Controller) pattern. 
Spoiler: it’s not as different as it sounds but Django definitely does things its own way. – Handles business logic and database structure. – The UI: what the user sees (HTML, CSS). – Logic that connects user input, the model, and the viewClassic, clean, and logical.
  
  
  Django’s MVT — The Same but Different
Django swaps out some names and bakes a few decisions into the framework for you. Here's Django's version: – Still your database structure and logic, powered by Django ORM – Unlike MVC, this is your Python function or class that handles requests and responses – Where your HTML and front end presentation livesAnd the  stays the same
  
  
  Visualizing the Architecture
Here's a side-by-side comparison I found helpful:MVC                        Django MVT
--------------------      --------------------
Model       →  Model       (unchanged)
View        →  Template    (the UI)
Controller  →  View        (Python logic)
And here's a diagram that makes it even clearer:This really helped me lock in Django's flow: Request → View (logic) → Model (if needed) → Template (response)Here’s what made it click. I wrote this Django view:def home(request):
    return render(request, 'home.html', {'msg': 'Welcome to Day 5!'})
Then connected it to , where I rendered that  variable. That’s when it hit me:The  here is controlling the flow it’s the Controller.The  is responsible only for display just like MVC's View.Suddenly, MVT made total sense.I used to misplace logic doing too much in templates or confusing Django’s terminology. Now:I know where business logic belongs (views and models)I respect Django’s separation of concernsI debug faster, because I understand what each layer is responsible forCreated function-based views with context dataConnected views to templates using urls.pyExplored class-based views (will dive deeper soon)This laid the groundwork for understanding more advanced patterns like mixins, CBVs, and reusable components.“MVT helped me understand MVC more clearly.”Funny how Django’s unique naming convention challenged me then clarified everything I’d half-learned in other frameworks.If you’re new to Django or architecture in general, don’t stress. Let the code teach you. The more you build, the clearer it becomes.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>EvoAgentX for Energy Markets: Build AI Agents That See the Risk Before the Spike</title><link>https://dev.to/evoagentx/evoagentx-for-energy-markets-build-ai-agents-that-see-the-risk-before-the-spike-g8d</link><author>EvoAgentX</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 15:33:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The future of oil price intelligence isn’t on Wall Street — it’s open-source, evolving, and just one prompt away.

This isn't science fiction; it's the reality of generative AI, specifically text-to-image models. These powerful algorithms are transforming how we create and interact with visual content, ushering in a new era of artistic expression and technological innovation.Understanding the Magic: How Text Becomes an ImageAt its core, a text-to-image model is a sophisticated computer program trained on massive datasets of images and their corresponding text descriptions. Think of it like teaching a child to draw by showing them countless pictures and telling them what they depict. Over time, the child learns to associate words with visual elements – a "fluffy white cat" evokes images of soft fur and round eyes. Similarly, these AI models learn the complex relationships between words and visual features.The process begins with a text prompt, a sentence or paragraph describing the desired image. This prompt is then fed into a neural network – a complex system inspired by the human brain – that has been trained to understand the meaning and nuances of language and translate them into visual representations. The network doesn't simply search for pre-existing images; it generates entirely new ones based on its learned understanding. It essentially "paints" a picture based on your textual instructions.This process involves several intricate steps, including: The model converts the text prompt into a numerical representation that it can understand. Using this numerical representation, the model generates a latent representation, a compressed form of the image.  The latent representation is then decoded into a full-fledged image, often using techniques like diffusion models that gradually refine a noisy image into a coherent one.Significance and Impact: A New Creative FrontierThe significance of text-to-image models cannot be overstated. They democratize image creation, empowering individuals without artistic training to generate stunning visuals. This has profound implications across numerous fields:Marketing and Advertising: Businesses can quickly and cost-effectively create compelling visuals for campaigns, websites, and social media.  Generating diverse and detailed game assets becomes significantly faster and more efficient.  Text-to-image models can aid in concept art, storyboarding, and even generating background elements.  Students can use these tools to visualize abstract concepts and create engaging educational materials.  Artists can utilize these models as powerful creative tools, augmenting their own skills and exploring new artistic styles.Applications and Transformative Potential:The potential applications are vast and rapidly expanding. Imagine architects using text prompts to visualize building designs, fashion designers creating virtual garment prototypes, or scientists visualizing complex biological structures. The ability to translate abstract ideas into concrete visual representations opens up exciting possibilities across industries, accelerating innovation and streamlining workflows.Challenges, Limitations, and Ethical Considerations:Despite its immense potential, text-to-image technology faces several challenges:  Models trained on biased datasets can perpetuate harmful stereotypes in generated images.  Addressing this requires careful curation of training data and ongoing monitoring.  The legal implications of AI-generated art are still being debated, raising questions about ownership and copyright infringement.Misinformation and Deepfakes:  The ease of creating realistic but fake images raises concerns about the spread of misinformation and the potential for malicious use.  While creating new opportunities, the technology also raises concerns about potential job displacement in certain creative industries.The Future of Text-to-Image Models:Text-to-image models are still evolving rapidly. Future developments will likely focus on improving image quality, enhancing control over generation parameters, and mitigating ethical concerns. We can expect to see more sophisticated models capable of understanding complex prompts, generating more realistic and diverse images, and even creating interactive and animated content directly from text.In conclusion, generative AI's text-to-image models represent a significant leap forward in artificial intelligence and its application to visual content creation. While challenges remain, the transformative potential of this technology is undeniable. As it continues to evolve, it promises to revolutionize how we create, interact with, and understand the visual world around us, opening up exciting opportunities across numerous fields and shaping the future of creativity and innovation.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Creating a Website with Sphinx and Markdown</title><link>https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2025/07/01/creating-a-website-with-sphinx-and-markdown/</link><author>Mike</author><category>dev</category><category>official</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 12:28:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/">Python Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sphinx is a Python-based documentation builder. The Python documentation is written using Sphinx. The Sphinx project supports using ReStructuredText and Markdown, or a mixture of the two.

Then run the following command:python -m venv NAME_OF_VENV_FOLDEROnce you have the virtual environment, you need to activate it. Go into the  folder and run the activate command in there.Now you can install the dependencies that you need using pip, which will install them to your virtual environment.Here’s how to install them using pip:python -m pip install myst-parser sphinxOnce your packages are installed, you can learn how to set up your site!Now that your packages are installed, you must set up your Sphinx website. To create a barebones Sphinx site, run the following command inside your virtual environment:sphinx-quickstart NAME_OF_SITE_FOLDERIt will ask you a series of questions. The Sphinx documentation recommends keeping the source and build folders separate. Otherwise, you can set the other fields as needed or accept the defaults.You will now have the following tree structure in your SITE_FOLDER:You will work with the files and directories in this structure for the rest of the tutorial.The next step on your Sphinx journey is to enable Markdown support.Making Markdown Work in SphinxGo into the  directory and open the  file in your favorite Python IDE.

Decorators can be a bit mind-bending when first encountered and can also be a bit tricky to debug. But they are a neat way to add functionality to functions and classes. Decorators are also known as a “higher-order function”. This means that they can take one or more functions as arguments and return a function as its result. In other words, decorators will take the function they are decorating and extend its behavior while not actually modifying what the function itself does.

There have been two decorators in Python since version 2.2, namely **classmethod()** and **staticmethod()**. Then PEP 318 was put together and the decorator syntax was added to make decorating functions and methods possible in Python 2.4. Class decorators were proposed in PEP 3129 to be included in Python 2.6. They appear to work in Python 2.7, but the PEP indicates they weren’t accepted until Python 3, so I’m not sure what happened there.

Let’s start off by talking about functions in general to get a foundation to work from.

## The Humble Function

A function in Python and in many other programming languages is just a collection of reusable code. Some programmers will take an almost bash-like approach and just write all their code in a file with no functions. The code just runs from top to bottom. This can lead to a lot of copy-and-paste spaghetti code. Whenever two pieces of code do the same thing, they can almost always be put into a function. This will make updating your code easier since you’ll only have one place to update them.Make sure you save the file. Then, re-run the build command from the previous section.

  Authentication in Production Python: Beyond the Basics
In late 2022, a critical production incident at a previous employer stemmed from a subtle flaw in our authentication handling for background job processing. We were using Celery with Redis as a broker, and a deserialization vulnerability in a custom authentication middleware allowed an attacker to inject malicious code into a job payload, ultimately gaining read access to sensitive data. The root cause wasn’t a missing security library, but a failure to properly validate the authentication token  the deserialization process, coupled with overly permissive pickling. This incident underscored the fact that authentication isn’t a single point solution; it’s a pervasive concern woven throughout the entire system, demanding meticulous attention to detail.  This post dives deep into the practicalities of authentication in modern Python ecosystems, focusing on architecture, performance, and real-world pitfalls.
  
  
  What is "authentication" in Python?
Technically, authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or service. It answers the question "Who are you?".  In Python, there isn’t a single, definitive PEP governing authentication directly. However, PEP 484 – Type Hints, and the broader ecosystem around static typing (mypy) are crucial for building robust authentication systems.  The  module, , and  allow us to define strict schemas for authentication tokens and credentials, enabling compile-time validation and reducing runtime errors.  CPython’s internal mechanisms for object identity () and hashing are fundamental to secure token generation and comparison.  The standard library’s  provides cryptographic hashing algorithms, but relying solely on it for authentication is rarely sufficient; dedicated libraries like  are essential for secure key management and encryption.FastAPI Request Handling:  In a high-throughput API, authentication is typically handled via JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) passed in the  header.  We use a custom FastAPI dependency to extract, verify, and decode the JWT, attaching the user identity to the request context.  Performance is critical here; JWT verification must be fast to avoid latency spikes.Async Job Queues (Celery/RQ): As demonstrated by the incident above, authenticating tasks submitted to an asynchronous queue is vital.  We now sign task payloads with a HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) using a rotating secret key, verifying the signature before deserialization.Type-Safe Data Models (Pydantic):  When receiving data from external sources (e.g., user uploads, API calls), Pydantic models are used to define the expected schema. Authentication credentials are often embedded within these models, and validation ensures that only authorized data is processed.  For command-line tools interacting with sensitive resources, we employ API keys or OAuth 2.0 tokens.  These credentials are stored securely (e.g., using ) and used to authenticate requests to a backend service.ML Preprocessing Pipelines:  Data pipelines often require access to sensitive data. Authentication is used to control access to data sources and ensure that only authorized users can train or deploy models.
  
  
  Integration with Python Tooling
Our  reflects our commitment to static typing and code quality:We use FastAPI’s dependency injection system to manage authentication.  A custom middleware extracts the JWT, and a dependency validates it.  This separation of concerns makes testing easier and improves code readability.  Runtime hooks, like signal handlers, are used to refresh JWTs before they expire.This example demonstrates a dependency injection pattern for authentication.  The  function is a dependency that extracts and validates the JWT, returning the user ID.  This pattern promotes reusability and testability.
  
  
  Failure Scenarios & Debugging
A common failure is incorrect JWT verification due to a mismatched secret key or algorithm.  This often manifests as a .  Debugging involves:  Detailed logging of the JWT payload and verification process.  Stepping through the  function to inspect the token and key.  Analyzing the full traceback to identify the source of the error. Adding assertions to verify the expected format and content of the JWT.Another issue is race conditions in asynchronous authentication.  If multiple requests attempt to authenticate simultaneously, the verification process can become interleaved, leading to incorrect results.  Using appropriate locking mechanisms (e.g., ) can mitigate this risk.  We once encountered a memory leak in a Celery worker due to unclosed database connections within an authentication middleware.   and  were instrumental in identifying the leak.
  
  
  Performance & Scalability
JWT verification is a performance bottleneck.  We’ve optimized this by:  Caching verified JWT payloads in Redis to avoid redundant verification.Asynchronous Verification:  Performing JWT verification asynchronously using .  Minimizing the use of global variables in the authentication process.  Exploring the use of C extensions for cryptographic operations (though the gains are often marginal).Benchmarking with  and asyncio.run(async_benchmark()) is crucial to measure the impact of these optimizations.Insecure deserialization, as experienced in our production incident, is a major risk.  Always validate the authentication token  deserializing any data associated with it.  Avoid using  for untrusted data.  Code injection can occur if user-supplied data is used to construct SQL queries or shell commands.  Use parameterized queries and proper input validation to prevent this.  Privilege escalation can occur if authentication checks are bypassed or if users are granted excessive permissions.  Implement least privilege principles and regularly review access controls.We employ a multi-layered testing strategy:  Testing individual authentication functions and dependencies.  Testing the interaction between authentication and other components (e.g., FastAPI routes, Celery tasks).Property-Based Tests (Hypothesis):  Generating random JWT payloads to test the robustness of the verification process.  Ensuring that all authentication code is type-safe.Our CI/CD pipeline includes: with code coverage reporting. for testing against multiple Python versions.GitHub Actions to run tests and linters on every pull request. hooks to enforce code style and type checking.
  
  
  Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns
Storing Passwords in Plain Text:  Never store passwords directly. Use strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).Using  for Untrusted Data:  As mentioned,  is inherently insecure.  Always verify the  claim in JWTs.Overly Permissive Access Controls:  Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions.Lack of Input Validation:  Validate all user-supplied data to prevent injection attacks.  Never hardcode secrets in your code. Use environment variables or a secrets management system.
  
  
  Best Practices & Architecture
  Use type hints extensively to improve code correctness and maintainability.  Separate authentication logic from business logic.  Assume that all user input is malicious.  Break down authentication into small, reusable components.  Use a layered configuration system to manage secrets and settings.  Use dependency injection to improve testability and flexibility.  Automate testing, linting, and deployment.  Use Docker or other containerization technologies to ensure reproducible builds.  Document all authentication code thoroughly.Authentication is a complex and critical aspect of modern Python systems.  Mastering the nuances of authentication, from secure token generation to robust validation and performance optimization, is essential for building reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications.  Prioritize static typing, rigorous testing, and a security-first mindset.  Refactor legacy code to address potential vulnerabilities, measure performance to identify bottlenecks, and continuously improve your authentication practices.  The cost of a security breach far outweighs the effort required to build a secure authentication system.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Day 9/100: While Loops with Real-World Examples</title><link>https://dev.to/therahul_gupta/day-9100-while-loops-with-real-world-examples-528f</link><author>Rahul Gupta</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 12:22:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to  of the  series!

  Introduction: Why Neural Networks Matter
Have you ever wondered how Netflix recommends your next binge-worthy series? Or how voice assistants like Siri or Alexa understand your commands? The magic behind these smart systems lies in —a core component of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning.Neural networks are not just a buzzword in tech circles. They’re the backbone of facial recognition, fraud detection, chatbots, self-driving cars, and even medical diagnosis. In this blog, we’ll explore what neural networks are, how they work, and why they’re so powerful—all in simple, non-intimidating language.
  
  
  🧠 What Is a Neural Network?
A  is a computational model inspired by the human brain. Just like your brain uses neurons to process information, neural networks use  (also called nodes) to recognize patterns and make decisions.Imagine it as a web of interconnected nodes that take inputs, perform calculations, and produce outputs. These networks learn from data—meaning they can  as they see more examples.
  
  
  🔄 Real-Life Analogy: Neural Networks as Decision-Making Recipes
Let’s say you're teaching a child to recognize apples. You show them 10 different apples and say, “These are apples.” Over time, the child starts identifying apples based on color, shape, or texture.Neural networks do the same thing but with numbers. Feed them enough labeled images, and they’ll “learn” the characteristics of an apple without being explicitly programmed. This process is called .
  
  
  🧱 Anatomy of a Neural Network
A typical neural network has three types of layers:Receives raw data (e.g., image pixels, sound waves, or text).The “thinking” layers. Each neuron processes input and passes it to the next layer. These layers extract meaningful features from the data.Gives the final prediction (e.g., "apple" or "not apple").Each neuron applies a , adds a , and then passes the result through an  (like ReLU or Sigmoid) to decide what to "fire" forward.
  
  
  ⚙️ How Neural Networks Learn: Backpropagation and Training
Training a neural network is like fine-tuning a guitar. You start with random settings (weights), play a note (make a prediction), listen to how off it sounds (calculate error), and then adjust the strings (update weights) using  and .This cycle continues until the network gets really good at making accurate predictions. The more data you feed it, the smarter it becomes.
  
  
  💡 Types of Neural Networks (And What They’re Good At)
Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)Basic tasks like classificationConvolutional Neural Network (CNN)Image recognition, computer visionRecurrent Neural Network (RNN)Time-series data, language modelingLSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)Text generation, translationGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs)Image generation, deep fakes
  
  
  🚀 Real-World Applications of Neural Networks
: Predicting diseases from X-rays or ECGs: Fraud detection, algorithmic trading: Personalized recommendations, inventory forecasting: Music composition, movie recommendations: Object detection, path planning
  
  
  🧩 Challenges of Neural Networks
Despite their power, neural networks have limitations:: They require lots of labeled dataComputationally Expensive: Training deep networks can take hours or even days: Hard to interpret how they make decisions: They may memorize data instead of learning patternsBut with techniques like , , and , many of these challenges are being actively addressed.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Transposer: A Lightweight, Training-Free Neural Architecture That Learns from Raw Embeddings Without Attention</title><link>https://dev.to/lumgenlab/transposer-a-lightweight-training-free-neural-architecture-that-learns-from-raw-embeddings-39h3</link><author>LumGenLab</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 10:08:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the current landscape of artificial intelligence, most breakthroughs in language understanding rely on scaling — larger models, bigger datasets, more compute.

  🧠 Why Build an Alternative to Attention?
Attention mechanisms — though powerful — come with significant trade-offs:Quadratic time complexity in input lengthHeavy reliance on massive corpora and training cycles: multi-head layers, residual connections, layer norm, positional encoding: attention scores don’t always tell us why something was learnedTransposer asks:Can we build something simpler, leaner, and just as meaningful — by rethinking how embeddings interact?The answer lies in a concept most students encounter in early math: .In standard NLP models, token embeddings are processed  — meaning each token is treated independently across its vector dimensions.What if we  this embedding matrix — and treat embedding dimensions as the context and ?This reorients the model’s view of language, allowing it to discover cross-token relationships and  using only field projection.
  
  
  🧬 The Architecture of Transposer

Let’s break down the architecture step by step:Input is tokenized and embedded into a matrix X of shape:L = sequence length (number of tokens)The embedding matrix is transposed:This allows processing across embedding dimensions, treating tokens as contextual dimensions.Two learned linear transformations are applied:H = ReLU(W₁ × Xᵀ)  
Z = W₂ × H
K is an internal projection dimension (hyperparameter)This returns the transformed embeddings back to the original orientation.The original and transformed embeddings are merged:This is an , preserving local structure while enriching with globally-learned relationships.
Transposer has been tested on toy datasets with as few as . Despite its simplicity and lack of training, it was able to extract surprisingly intelligent relationships:"education" → ["learning", "by", "preparing"]

Your frontend sends filter parameters as comma-separated strings (because that's how query params work), but you want proper typing with enums and optional lists on the backend.
GET /api/products?status=ACTIVE,PENDING&category=ELECTRONICS,BOOKS
But Pydantic expects lists, and you want enum validation. Plus everything should be optional.Standard Pydantic approach fails here:The client sends  as a single string, but you need [ProductStatus.ACTIVE, ProductStatus.PENDING].Use  with a custom parser that handles both string-to-list conversion and enum casting:: FastAPI automatically wraps query param values in lists: Runs before Pydantic's standard validation: Takes the first item from the list (the comma-separated string) and splits it: If enum type provided, casts each item to the enum: Final result is properly typed for your business logicThis hit me when refactoring an existing API. The frontend was using DiceUI filters that send multiple values as comma-separated strings. First attempt was parsing directly in each model - messy and not reusable. Every endpoint would need its own parsing logic.After about 2 hours of digging through Pydantic docs, I found . Perfect fit - handles the transformation before validation, keeps models clean, and works everywhere.The beauty is writing minimal code that solves the problem once and reuses everywhere.: Full enum validation and IDE support: Handles missing params gracefully: Works with any enum or plain strings: Business logic gets properly typed dataThe  pattern is perfect for these "format transformation + validation" scenarios.That's it!

  Hono and Django now available on Diploi
There are two powerful new additions to Diploi,  and !These frameworks are now officially supported, meaning you can deploy, host, and manage full applications with Hono or/and Django with one clickis a small, simple, and ultrafast web framework built on Web Standards. It works on any JavaScript runtime: Cloudflare Workers, Fastly Compute, Deno, Bun, Vercel, Netlify, AWS Lambda, Lambda@Edge, and Node.js.Hono is mainly used for backend applications, like APIs, proxy servers, edge apps, and typical servers, but that's not all, it can also serve HTML and UI components, so it is appropiate to think of Hono as a fullstack framework. You can think of Hono as a modern alternative to Express, which supports Typescript and can be used with the most popular runtimes availableHono aims to make your life easier by enabling API Spec and type inference via Hono's RPC, which transforms how you can share types and API expected responses between server and client, into a smooth experience. Additionally, Hono has multiple helpers and middlewares to handle typical operations, like managing Cookies, JWT, Webhooks, authentication, and headers, so you don't need external libraries to handle these actionsDjango is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.In simpler terms, Django is a framework for building web applications, and it is mostly considered a backend framework because it features ORM, auth, middleware, and other typical backend features, but it can also serve HTML and handle frontend templating just like fullstack frameworks, so it is fair to think that Django is whatever you need it to be 😅Django uses a pattern they call Model-View-Template (MVT), which is similar to Model-View-Controller (MVC), with their main difference being that in MVT, the View and Controller from MVC are technically bundled together into the View from MVTFun fact: Before this blog, I didn't know that Django has been around since 2005... damn 🫡
  
  
  Using Django and Hono with other frameworks in Diploi
If you would like to test out how these frameworks work together with other frameworks, you can use Diploi to create monorepo applications, where you can for example, have Django as your backend and Astro in the frontend, or Hono as your API server with a Next.js fullstack app, or any other combination of frameworks and databases that fits your requirementsDiploi will then start a remote development environment that allows you to code in the browser and your application is deployed online. If you would like to start your application with a GitHub repository, all you need to do is register using GitHub and you will be able to start a new repository with your new applicationWhat frameworks should we support next?

The secret sauce is often a data structure called the Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM-Tree) and its core component, the Sorted String Table (SSTable).In this post, we’ll build a toy, educational SSTable-based storage engine in Python, inspired by Martin Kleppmann’s Designing Data-Intensive Applications. We’ll start simple and gradually add complexity, so you can follow along even if you’re new to storage internals!An  is a file format for storing large, sorted key-value pairs on disk. The key properties are:: All keys are stored in order, making range queries and binary search possible.: Once written, SSTables are never modified. New data is written to new files.: By combining in-memory and on-disk structures, SSTables enable fast writes and reasonably fast reads.SSTables are the backbone of LSM-Trees, which power many modern databases.: An in-memory, sorted key-value store.: Writes sorted key-value pairs to disk as an SSTable, with a sparse index and Bloom filter.: Reads from SSTables using the index and Bloom filter.: Orchestrates the LSM-Tree logic, combining memtable and SSTables.: A simple Bloom filter for fast negative lookups.: A UNIX socket server exposing set/get operations.: A CLI client to interact with the server.: A script to stress test the system.
  
  
  Step 1: The Memtable – Fast In-Memory Writes
When you write data, it first lands in the —a sorted, in-memory structure. In our Python version, we use a sorted list and the  module for efficient lookups and inserts.When the memtable gets too big, we  it to disk as a new SSTable.
  
  
  Step 2: Writing SSTables – Persistence and Order
Flushing the memtable means writing all its sorted key-value pairs to a file. But how do we make reads efficient?: Every Nth key and its file offset are written to an index file. This lets us quickly jump to the right part of the SSTable.: A probabilistic data structure that tells us if a key is  in the file, saving unnecessary disk reads.

  
  
  Step 3: Reading SSTables – Fast Lookups
When you want to read a key: (fastest). for each SSTable (quickly skip files that don’t have the key). to jump to the right spot in the SSTable file and scan for the key.

  
  
  Step 4: The LSM-Tree – Orchestrating Everything
The  class manages the memtable, SSTable files, and the index cache. It handles:: Write to memtable, flush to SSTable when full.: Check memtable, then SSTables from newest to oldest.

  
  
  Step 5: Server and CLI – Putting It All Together
We expose our storage engine via a simple UNIX socket server (). You can interact with it using the CLI ():python  sstable_server   
python  main mykey 123
python  main get mykey
How does it perform? The  script:Inserts 1000 random key-value pairsReads them all back and prints the sum and average
: LSM-Trees and SSTables are designed for fast, sequential writes—perfect for write-heavy workloads.: Sparse indexes and Bloom filters keep reads fast, even as data grows.: These ideas power LevelDB, RocksDB, Cassandra, and more.This project is a —but it’s a great way to learn! You can extend it by adding:Compaction (merging old SSTables)Deletion markers (tombstones)Building your own SSTable-based storage engine is a fantastic way to understand the internals of modern databases.

Your workers could be on fire, stuck in an endless queue, and you'd be the one to blame here. where we're staring at logs hoping to divine the health of our distributed systems. Time to set up some proper monitoring.Celery is one way of doing distributed task processing, but it's opaque when it comes to observability. You can see logs, but logs don't tell you if workers are healthy, how long tasks are taking, or whether your queue is backing up. That's where Flower comes in, it's the one of the monitoring tools for Celery environments.This guide covers integrating Flower with Prometheus and Grafana to get proper metrics-driven monitoring. Whether you're using Grafana Cloud, self-hosted Grafana, the k8s-monitoring Helm chart, or individual components, we'll walk through the setup, explain why each piece matters, and tackle the gotchas.Kubernetes cluster with Celery workers already runningSome form of Prometheus-compatible metrics collection (Alloy, Prometheus Operator, plain Prometheus, etc.)Grafana instance (cloud or self-hosted)Basic Kubernetes knowledgePatience for the inevitable configuration mysteries
  
  
  Understanding the Architecture
Before diving into configuration, let's understand what we're building. Flower sits between your Celery workers and your monitoring system. It connects to your message broker (Redis/RabbitMQ), watches worker activity, and exposes metrics in Prometheus format.The flow looks like this:Celery workers process tasks from the brokerFlower monitors the broker and worker activityFlower exposes metrics at  endpointYour metrics collector (Prometheus/Alloy) scrapes these metricsGrafana visualizes the dataThe key insight is that Flower doesn't directly monitor workers, it monitors the broker's state and worker events, which is why it can give you a complete picture of your distributed system.
  
  
  The Setup: Flower with Prometheus Metrics
Here's the thing about Flower, it's great at showing you pretty graphs in its web UI, but getting it to export metrics for Prometheus requires a specific flag that's easy to miss. By default, Flower only exposes basic Python process metrics, which are useless for understanding your Celery workload.
  
  
  Deploy Flower (the Right Way)
That  flag is doing the heavy lifting here. Without it, you'll get basic Python process metrics (memory usage, GC stats, etc.) but none of the Celery-specific goodness like worker status, task counts, or queue depths. This flag tells Flower to export its internal monitoring data in Prometheus format.The broker URL needs to match exactly what your Celery workers are using. Flower connects to the same broker to observe worker activity and task flow. If there's a mismatch, Flower won't see your workers.The named port () is crucial for ServiceMonitor configurations later. Many monitoring setups rely on port names rather than numbers for service discovery, making your configuration more resilient to port changes.
  
  
  Metrics Collection: Choose Your Adventure
How you get these metrics into your monitoring system depends entirely on your infrastructure setup. Kubernetes monitoring has evolved into several different patterns, each with its own tradeoffs.
  
  
  Option 1: ServiceMonitor (Prometheus Operator/k8s-monitoring)
ServiceMonitors are part of the Prometheus Operator ecosystem and provide declarative configuration for scrape targets. They're the cleanest approach if you're using Prometheus Operator or the k8s-monitoring Helm chart.The critical detail here is  vs . ServiceMonitors reference the service's port definition, not the container port directly. This indirection allows you to change container ports without updating monitoring configs.Getting this configuration right requires the same attention to detail as any other infrastructure code.One character difference can mean the difference between working monitoring and hours of debugging.Here, the  restricts which namespaces this ServiceMonitor applies to. Without it, the ServiceMonitor tries to find matching services across all namespaces, which can cause confusion in multitenant clusters.
  
  
  Option 2: Prometheus Annotations
If you're using vanilla Prometheus with annotation based discovery, you configure scraping through service annotations. This is simpler but less flexible than ServiceMonitors.The annotations tell Prometheus to scrape this service. Your Prometheus configuration needs to include a job that discovers services with these annotations. This approach is more straightforward but offers less control over scraping behavior.
  
  
  Option 3: Alloy Configuration (Manual)
Grafana Alloy offers more flexibility than traditional Prometheus. You can configure complex discovery and relabeling rules to handle dynamic environments.This configuration discovers pods with the  label, applies relabeling rules to construct proper scrape targets, and forwards metrics to your storage backend. The relabeling rules transform Kubernetes metadata into the format Prometheus expects.
  
  
  Option 4: Static Prometheus Config
For simple setups or development environments, static configuration is the most straightforward approach.This hardcodes the service endpoint, which works fine for stable environments but doesn't handle dynamic scaling or service changes gracefully.
  
  
  Verification: Making Sure It Actually Works
Before diving into dashboard creation, verify that metrics are flowing correctly. This saves hours of troubleshooting later when you're wondering why your graphs are empty.
  
  
  Check the Metrics Endpoint
kubectl port-forward svc/flower-service 5555:5555
curl http://localhost:5555/metrics
You should see metrics that look like this:flower_worker_online{worker="celery@worker-1"} 1.0
flower_events_total{task="process_data",type="task-sent"} 127.0
flower_worker_number_of_currently_executing_tasks{worker="celery@worker-1"} 3.0
flower_task_prefetch_time_seconds{task="process_data",worker="celery@worker-1"} 0.001
If you're only seeing basic Python metrics (python_gc_objects_collected_total, process_resident_memory_bytes, etc.), you're missing the  flag. The Celery-specific metrics are what make this whole exercise worthwhile.
  
  
  Check Your Monitoring System
The verification process depends on your monitoring setup:For ServiceMonitor setups: Check the Prometheus Operator or Alloy UI for discovered targets. Look for your Flower service in the targets list with status "UP".: Navigate to your Prometheus targets page () and verify the Flower job appears with healthy status.: Check your collector's logs for any scraping errors and verify the target appears in the monitoring system's target list.
  
  
  Understanding the Metrics
Flower exports several categories of metrics, each providing different insights into your Celery system::  tells you which workers are active. flower_worker_number_of_currently_executing_tasks shows current load per worker.:  tracks task lifecycle events (sent, received, started, succeeded, failed). These form the basis for throughput and success rate calculations.: flower_task_runtime_seconds (histogram) shows task execution duration. flower_task_prefetch_time_seconds measures queue wait time.: Various metrics help you understand queue depth and processing patterns.
  
  
  Building Useful Dashboards
Now for the payoff - turning those metrics into actionable insights. The key is building dashboards that help you answer specific operational questions.: "Are my workers running? How many are active?"# Total online workers
sum(flower_worker_online)

# Per-worker status
flower_worker_online
: "How many tasks are we processing? Is throughput increasing?"# Tasks being sent to workers (per second)
rate(flower_events_total{type="task-sent"}[5m])

# Tasks being processed (per second)
rate(flower_events_total{type="task-received"}[5m])
: "Is my queue backing up? How long do tasks wait?"# Tasks currently executing
sum(flower_worker_number_of_currently_executing_tasks)

# Time tasks spend waiting in queue
flower_task_prefetch_time_seconds
: "How long do tasks take? Are they getting slower?"# 95th percentile task duration
histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(flower_task_runtime_seconds_bucket[5m]))

# Median task duration
histogram_quantile(0.50, rate(flower_task_runtime_seconds_bucket[5m]))

  
  
  Dashboard Design Philosophy specifically for celery
Start with high-level health indicators, then provide drill-down capabilities. A good Celery dashboard answers these questions in order:: Are workers running? Is the system processing tasks?: How much work are we doing? Is it increasing or decreasing?: How fast are tasks completing? Are there performance regressions?: Are tasks backing up? Where are the bottlenecks?Real Celery deployments often have specialized workers for different task types. CPU-intensive tasks, I/O-bound tasks, and priority queues all need separate monitoring.Each Flower instance monitors a specific Celery app, giving you granular visibility into different workload types. You'll need separate services and scrape configurations for each instance.This approach lets you set different SLAs and alerting thresholds for different workload types. Your real-time fraud detection tasks might need sub-second response times, while your batch report generation can tolerate longer delays.Flower itself is lightweight, but its resource needs scale with worker count and task frequency. A busy system with hundreds of workers and thousands of tasks per minute will use more memory to track state.For self-hosted setups, configure Grafana to read from your Prometheus instance:This assumes Prometheus and Grafana are in the same cluster. For cross-cluster or external access, you'll need appropriate networking and authentication configuration.Production Flower deployments need proper security controls. Flower's web interface shows detailed information about your task processing, which could be sensitive.Enable basic authentication at minimum:For production systems, consider OAuth integration or running Flower behind an authentication proxy. Celery-exporter provides similar metrics without the web interface overhead. It's purpose-built for Prometheus integration and might use fewer resources than Flower. However, you lose Flower's web interface for ad-hoc investigation.Getting Celery monitoring right requires attention to several key details:The  flag transforms Flower from a simple web interface into a proper metrics exporterYour metrics collection method should match your infrastructure setup and operational preferencesServiceMonitor port configuration matters -  references service ports,  references container portsLabel matching between ServiceMonitors, services, and pods must be exactYour monitoring system's target discovery UI is invaluable for debugging configuration issuesThe setup might seem complicated, but each piece serves a specific purpose in building a robust monitoring system. Once you have this foundation, you can extend it with alerting rules, additional dashboards, and integration with your incident response workflow.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>😱 Spent 3 days chasing a ghost bug?</title><link>https://dev.to/aleksei_aleinikov/spent-3-days-chasing-a-ghost-bug-3imi</link><author>Aleksei Aleinikov</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 07:29:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[🔥 Next time: fix it in 3 minutes.A tiny Python feature (since 3.8) turns prints into instant micro-logs — no setup, no overhead, pure clarity.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🐍💥 Think bytearray is just a Python toy?

The aim of the project is to deliver a community resource for all things tech in the Inland Northwest while providing an opportunity for contributes to gain real-world experience in a shared open source project.There is a thriving tech community in Spokane, but many members of our community are disconnected. With multiple tech groups on different platforms, such as meetup and eventbright, there are often events of interest happening that many tech enthusiasts are not aware of. The intent is to have a single resource that includes local tech groups and the events they host.Many developers in our community, especially those earlier in their career, have skills and drive, but haven't had the opportunity to work on a project in a real professional environment. For example, a developer could have great knowledge in coding, but hasn't yet had the first professional job or participated in project with milestones, project planning, code reviews, etc. The Spokane Tech project aims to provide this and give contributes a project they can reference for career development, personal portfolios, interviews, etc. What our project (and webapp) becomes will ultimately be dictated by members of the project and will likely evolve over time. Below are some details of the initial vision.Have a web site that houses groups and events. Events may be manually or automatically added to our site. We will have views that list all the groups and events, as well as detail pages for each group and event. Ideally we'll also have a calendar view that can list all events and perhaps be filterable.Have event requests and suggestions capabilities. Here members can post a suggested events they want to give or have someone else give, and others can up/down vote the event (think reddit or stackoverflow). This can be used to prioritize events base on community interest. This can also serve as a living backlog of event ideas. Add labels to events, such as technical areas (frontend, scripting, ML, etc.) and topic levels (beginner/intermediate/etc.). With labels people can filter event based on interest and other criteria.Build member profiles. With profiles, we can have some basic metrics on things like career level, geographic location, interested and expertise. This data can help provide viability into the overall tech presence in Spokane and help drive event topics and location. This could also be a future resource to make available to local businesses and the community for things like contract work, etc. (There has been some outside interest in this type of resource)The Spokane Tech project was started mostly by members of the Spokane Python User Group (SPUG), so naturally the first version of the website is based on python. In the future the project may be re-created in other languages/frameworks/etc. (such as Golang or Rust) as member interest dictates. This is intended to foster growth, knowledge-sharing, and exposure to different tech stacks and methodologies.Interested in participating? Great! Read on...Here are a few things you can do to get started.Look through the open issues and find one that interests you (issues tagged "good first issue" could be great candidates) on githubRead our blog to learn more about the project, follow development and design decisions, and step through the process of building the site. Clone the repo to you machine and run locally, explore the code, break things, fix things, have fun. Step by step instructions are in the CONTRIBUTION doc on github.Have a feature idea or found a bug? Create an issue on github.Need more help or direction?New to python, django, git, webdev? Reach out in the Discord channel and suggest a virtual meet. We'll schedule these on occasion, or as interest dictates.

When an agent fails, our first instinct is to blame its "brain" (the LLM). But the real culprit is often the arsenal we equipped it with—the collection of weapons was dull, confusing, or simply not right for the job.In our previous tutorial, LLM Agents are simply Graph — Tutorial For Dummies, we revealed that every agent is like a warrior following a simple battle plan: Assess -> Strike -> Repeat. We showed how the 'assessing' happens in a decision node that plans the next move. Now, it's time to forge the weapons used for the .That 'Strike' is powered by the agent's —the official set of weapons, tools, and spells it can draw upon. In technical terms, this is its . This isn't just a list of functions; it is the very soul of your agent's power. A well-forged arsenal, where every blade is sharp and serves a unique purpose, is the difference between an agent that is defeated by the first obstacle and one that conquers any challenge.In this guide, you are the master blacksmith. Using the transparent and powerful  framework as your forge, we will teach you how to craft an arsenal of actions that will turn your agent from a clumsy squire into a legendary warrior.The Battle Tactician: How an Agent Chooses Its WeaponSo, we have an arsenal. But how does the agent, our digital warrior, know when to draw a longsword for a close-quarters fight versus firing a bow from a distance?This critical decision happens in the —the agent's battle tactician. At its core, every agent is just a simple loop that consults its tactician, who then chooses an action from the arsenal. The chosen action is performed, and the results are reported back to the tactician to plan the next move.Visually, the battle plan looks like this: (The Tactician): This is the brain. It analyzes the battlefield (the user's request and current data).The Arrows (The Commands): Based on its analysis, the tactician issues a command: , , or . This is the branch in the graph.The Action Nodes (The Specialists): Each command goes to a specialist soldier who executes that one task.The Loop Back (The Report): After the specialist completes their task, they report back to the tactician with new information, and the cycle begins again."But what magic happens inside that  node?" you ask. "How does it  think?"This is the most misunderstood part of agent design, and the secret is shockingly simple.  There's no complex algorithm, just a carefully written set of instructions for the LLM.The tactician's "brain" is a prompt that looks something like this:### CONTEXT
You are a research assistant. Here is the current situation:
Question: {the user's original question}
Previous Actions: {a log of what has been done so far}
Current Information: {any data gathered from previous actions}

### ARSENAL (Available Actions)
Here are the weapons you can use. Choose one.

[1] search_web
  Description: Search the internet for up-to-date information.
  Parameters:
    - query (str): The specific topic to search for.

[2] write_file
  Description: Save text into a local file.
  Parameters:
    - filename (str): The name of the file to create.
    - content (str): The text content to write into the file.

[3] answer_question
  Description: Provide the final answer to the user.
  Parameters:
    - answer (str): The complete, final answer.

## YOUR NEXT COMMAND
Review the CONTEXT and choose the single best ACTION from your ARSENAL to proceed.
Format your response as a YAML block.
That's it! The agent's entire decision-making process boils down to this: the LLM reads the description of the situation and the "user manual" for every weapon in its arsenal, and then it picks the one that makes the most sense.The quality of its choice is 100% dependent on how clearly you describe its weapons. A sharp, well-defined arsenal in your prompt leads to a smart, effective agent. A vague, confusing one leads to a warrior who brings a knife to a dragon fight.Now, let's learn how to forge these weapons, from simple daggers to god-tier magic spells.Level Up Your Arsenal: The Three Tiers of Weapon ComplexityAs a master blacksmith, you wouldn't forge just one type of weapon. You need a full range, from simple daggers for quick jabs to powerful, enchanted swords for epic battles. The same is true for your agent's arsenal. Actions can be designed with varying levels of power and complexity. Let's explore the three tiers.Level 1: The Simple Dagger (The "Button" Action)A simple dagger is a no-frills weapon. You draw it, you use it. It does one thing, and it does it reliably. These are actions that require .Think of them as on/off switches or simple commands.
An action like  or .In the Arsenal (Prompt Description):[1] request_human_help
  Description: If you are stuck or need clarification, use this action to pause and ask the human user for guidance.

For clear, binary decisions. When the agent needs to signal a state change, like "I'm finished," "I'm stuck," or "I've failed." They are perfect for controlling the overall flow of the battle plan.Level 2: The Sharpshooter's Bow (The Parameterized Tool)A bow is useless without an arrow and a target. This weapon requires input to be effective. These are the most common and versatile actions in an agent's arsenal—actions that require  to function.To use these weapons, the agent must not only choose the bow but also aim it by providing the correct inputs.
An action like  or send_email(to, subject, body).In the Arsenal (Prompt Description):[2] search_web
  Description: Searches the public internet for a given text string.
  Parameters:
    - query (str): The precise search term to look up. Must be a focused string.

[3] send_email
  Description: Composes and sends an email to a recipient.
  Parameters:
    - to (str): The email address of the recipient.
    - subject (str): The subject line of the email.
    - body (str): The main content of the email.
The Crucial Link to Your Blacksmithing Skills:
How does the agent provide these parameters? This is where your skill in  becomes critical. As we covered in our guide, Structured Output for Beginners, you must instruct the LLM to format its response in a structured way (like YAML or JSON) so your program can easily parse the action  its parameters.Without this skill, you've given your agent a powerful bow but no way to nock an arrow.Level 3: The Spellbook of Creation (The Programmable Action)This is the ultimate weapon: a spellbook that doesn't contain a list of spells but teaches the agent how to . These are  where the agent generates code or complex instructions on the fly.This gives the agent god-like flexibility to solve novel problems you never explicitly trained it for.
An action like  or .In the Arsenal (Prompt Description):[4] execute_sql
  Description: Write and run a SQL query against the company's sales database. The database contains tables named 'customers', 'orders', and 'products'.
  Parameters:
    - sql_query (str): A valid SQL query string to execute.

[5] run_python_code
  Description: Write and execute a sandboxed Python script for complex calculations, data manipulation, or interacting with APIs.
  Parameters:
    - code (str): A string containing the Python code to run.

A spellbook is the most powerful weapon in your arsenal, but it's also the most dangerous. Your agent can solve almost any problem that can be expressed in code. It's no longer limited to pre-defined tools. It's much more likely to make a mistake (e.g., writing buggy code). More importantly, it opens up massive security risks if not handled carefully (e.g., executing malicious code like os.remove("important_file.txt")). Always run such code in a secure, sandboxed environment.Mastering these three tiers allows you to build a balanced and effective arsenal, equipping your agent for any challenge it might face.Forging the Perfect Arsenal: 3 Golden Rules for Your Weapon InventoryA legendary warrior doesn't just carry a random assortment of weapons. Their arsenal is carefully curated—each item is perfectly crafted, serves a distinct purpose, and is instantly accessible. As the master blacksmith for your agent, you must apply the same discipline. Here are the three golden rules for forging a world-class action space.Golden Rule #1: Engrave a Crystal-Clear User Manual (Clarity is King)The descriptions for your actions and their parameters are not notes for yourself; they are the . If the manual is vague, the LLM will misuse the tool. Be painfully, relentlessly explicit.A Dull Blade (Bad Description):search: searches for stuff
The agent sees this and thinks, "What stuff? How? What do I provide?" The result is a wild guess, like search(query="who won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics and what were their contributions in detail and also list prior winners"), a query too broad to be effective.A Sharpened Katana (Good Description):search_web(query: str):
  Description: Searches the public internet for up-to-date information on a single, specific topic. Returns the top 5 text snippets.
  Parameters:
    - query (str): A simple and focused search query, typically 3-5 words long.
Now the agent understands its constraints. It knows the tool is for  and the query should be . It will correctly generate a command like search_web(query: "2024 Nobel Prize Physics winner"), leading to a much better outcome.Golden Rule #2: Don't Burden Your Warrior with a Junk Drawer (Keep it Concise)A warrior grabbing a weapon in the heat of battle can't afford to sift through a hundred options. They need a small, elite set of choices. Overwhelming the LLM with too many actions leads to confusion, slower decision-making (more tokens to process), and a higher chance of picking the wrong tool.The Blacksmith's Guideline: An arsenal of 10 weapons is formidable. An arsenal of 100 is a junk drawer.If your action space is growing too large, it's a sign that your tools are too granular. Instead of creating , , and , forge a single, more powerful weapon: . Your code can handle the internal logic of parsing different file types. Keep the agent's choices clean and high-level.Golden Rule #3: Make Every Weapon Unique (Slay Redundancy)Every weapon in the arsenal should have a unique purpose. If the agent has two tools that do similar things, it will get confused about which one to use. This is called a lack of "orthogonality."The Confusing Arsenal (Bad Design):read_csv_from_disk(file_path: str): Reads customer data from a local CSV file.: Queries the live customer database.The agent is asked to "find the total sales for new customers from this quarter." Which tool should it use? The data might be in the CSV, or it might be in the database. The agent doesn't know and might make the wrong choice.The Pro-Gamer Move: Simplify the Battlefield
A true master blacksmith doesn't just forge weapons; they shape the battlefield to their advantage. Instead of giving the agent two ambiguous tools, do the work for it behind the scenes.The Decisive Arsenal (Good Design):
Before the agent even starts, run a script that loads the CSV data into a temporary table in the database.Now, the agent's arsenal is clean and unambiguous:: Queries the customer database, which contains all known customer data.The ambiguity is gone. The agent has one, and only one, tool for retrieving customer data. You've eliminated redundancy and made the agent's decision trivial, guaranteeing it makes the right choice every time.Conclusion: An Agent is Only as Sharp as its ArsenalAnd so, the secrets of the forge are yours. You now understand that the true power of an LLM agent doesn't come from some mysterious, hidden algorithm. It comes from the thoughtful, disciplined, and creative process of crafting its .You've learned that agents are just warriors in a , making decisions based on a prompt that serves as their battle plan. And you've seen how to stock their arsenal for any challenge:  With  for quick, decisive commands.  With  for precise, targeted actions.  With reality-bending  for ultimate flexibility.Most importantly, you now hold the three golden rules of the master blacksmith: Your descriptions are the agent's guide to victory. A curated, concise arsenal is deadlier than a cluttered one. Make every weapon unique to ensure the agent never hesitates.The next time you see a complex agent framework with thousands of lines of code, you won't be intimidated. You'll know to look past the noise and ask the fundamental questions: "What's in the arsenal? How is it described? Is it sharp, concise, and unique?"Armed with this knowledge, you are no longer just a coder; you are an . You have the power to forge not just tools, but intelligent, reliable, and effective digital warriors.Ready to light the forge?

Yes, if you focus on the right ones and use targeted practice. This guide breaks down the six most important data structures for beginner developers, with daily goals, real Python code, and hand-picked problems from LeetCode and HackerRank.Why Learn Data Structures First?What You’ll Learn in 7 DaysFrequently Asked Questions
  
  
  Why Learn Data Structures First?
If you're preparing for coding interviews, struggling to debug slow code, or trying to build real-world projects, learning data structures (DSA) is non-negotiable.Here’s why developers search for "how to learn DSA fast":Data structures are core to passing FAANG-style interviewsThey help you write faster, more memory-efficient codeThey're the foundation for real systems like compilers, frameworks, and databasesEven frontend developers need them to handle things like UI trees, state management, and algorithm-heavy featuresAnyone learning programming who skipped CS theoryIt’s designed for clarity, focus, and results in one week.
  
  
  What You’ll Learn in 7 Days
Indexing, memory layout, subarraysPointers, nodes, reverse listsLIFO, FIFO, scheduling logicTraversal, recursion, BST logicPractice, recall, mini project
  
  
  Day 1 – Arrays and Strings
: Understand memory layout, indexing, and basic operations.Immutability (for strings in most languages): Learn how to manage nodes and pointers.Insertion/deletion at head/tailSingly vs doubly linked lists
  
  
  Day 3 – Stacks and Queues
: Understand LIFO vs FIFO logic and when to use each.Use cases: undo systems, scheduling, recursion: Learn how to store key-value pairs with fast lookups.: Understand hierarchical data and recursive traversal.Binary Tree vs Binary Search Tree (BST)Preorder, Inorder, PostorderRecursion in traversal logic: Learn how to represent and traverse networked data.Graph search and connectivityRevisit questions you got wrong or skippedDraw structures from memory: arrays, trees, linked listsBuild 1 mini project: postfix calculator or CLI parserReflect: what confused you, and what became clear?
  
  
  Frequently Asked Questions

  
  
  What is the best order to learn data structures?
Start with arrays and linked lists, then stacks/queues, then hash maps, followed by trees and graphs. That’s the order used in most developer job prep tracks.
  
  
  Do frontend developers need to learn data structures?
Yes. You’ll use trees for UI rendering, hash maps for state updates, and stacks/queues for undo features and async tasks.
  
  
  How much DSA do I need to know for interviews?
For most junior-to-mid roles, you’ll need to master arrays, hash maps, linked lists, trees, and recursion. Graphs are optional unless you’re interviewing at big tech or for algorithm-heavy roles.
  
  
  Which programming language is best for learning data structures?
Python is beginner-friendly and clear. Java, C++, and JavaScript also work — but pick one and stick with it for consistency.
  
  
  Should I learn data structures before algorithms?
Yes. Algorithms  data structures. You can’t implement binary search or DFS if you don’t know how arrays or graphs work.Code every day, don’t just readSketch by hand, especially for trees and graphsOne language only, avoid switching mid-practiceIf stuck >15 minutes, review the concept, not the solutionIf this helped, I’ve got more like it.

That’s what this problem is all about! In LeetCode 3330, we explore how to compute the number of possible  that Alice might have intended to type, assuming she may have held one key too long just once.Let’s break it down in a clean and simple way. ✅A string  representing the final output after Alice’s typing (which may include ).Return the total number of distinct original strings Alice might have meant to type.A valid original string can be obtained by deleting  from a group of repeated characters.For every group of repeated characters, Alice  have held that key down too long. So for each such group:If the current character is the  as the previous one, then we could consider that extra character a mistake.Thus, each such repeat character gives us an extra valid original string possibility.Start with an answer initialized to 1 (the word itself is always valid).Traverse the string from the second character onward.Each time the current character matches the previous one, it represents an opportunity where a character might have been held too long.For each such case, increment your count.At most  might have been inserted due to a long press.Only consecutive repeated characters matter.Time complexity:  where  is the length of the string.This problem is a great exercise in pattern recognition and linear string traversal. If you're comfortable with character comparisons and edge cases like off-by-one errors, you’ll find this one a breeze.Keep up the great work — and remember, even Alice has typing troubles sometimes! 😄]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Seth Michael Larson: Hand-drawn QR codes</title><link>https://sethmlarson.dev/hand-drawn-qr-codes?utm_campaign=rss</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I knew what I wanted to do, I wanted to create a QR code on a sheet.
The smallest QR code (besides micro QR codes) is "version 1" which uses 21x21 pixels.
We'll have to split the squares in half and then use some of the margin.Version 1 QR codes can hold URLs up to 17 bytes long using the lowest
data quality setting. Unfortunately  is 23 bytes
long, so I'll have to improvise. I went with  instead, as this
will prompt many QR code scanners to "search" for the term resulting in my website.Note that a lovely reader informed me shortly after publication that indeed
  I can include my full domain name in a version 1 QR code by using all capital
  letters instead of lowercase. TIL that the "alphanumeric" character set for QR

the  option with  to not include a trailing newline.$ echo -n "HTTPS://SETHMLARSON.DEV" | qr --error-correction=L
I drew the corner squares (known as "position patterns") and then started trying
to scan the QR code as a gradually filled in other pixels. Once I had drawn the
"timing lines" between the top left and bottom left position I could
see that my scanner "wanted" to see something in my drawing.I continued adding the top timing line and data and then the scanner could
start to see the whole square as a QR code. If you look closely I even
made a mistake here in the data a bit, but in the end this didn't matter
even on the lowest error-correction level.Finally, my QR code was complete! Scanning the QR code was quite finicky because
the paper was curling up off the flat surface. I could only get the scan to work
when I held the paper flat. However, hanging the QR code from my monitor worked
extremely well, even when scanning from a distance.I hope this inspires you to try hand-drawing something on grid paper 🖤🤍

Steps to Develop a RAG Strategy4. How to Develop It (Example Python Code)5. Improving the Code for Better Production ResultsRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method that combines a  with a generative language model.Instead of relying solely on the model’s internal knowledge, it retrieves relevant information from an external document collection or knowledge base at inference time.This lets the model generate more accurate, context-aware answers grounded in actual data.The model's weights are  — it uses external data during the answer generation step.
  
  
  2. Steps to Develop a RAG Strategy
 Collect and preprocess your text data (PDFs, docs, etc.).Split documents into chunks: Break long texts into smaller pieces for efficient retrieval. Convert text chunks into vector embeddings using a sentence transformer model. Use a vector database (e.g., FAISS) to store embeddings for fast similarity search. Embed the user’s question and search for the most relevant document chunks. Combine retrieved documents and the user query into a prompt. Pass the prompt to a language model to produce a grounded response. Answer questions from product manuals and FAQs. Summarize academic papers or technical documents. Provide information based on legal texts or regulations. Answer questions from textbooks or course materials. Query company documents, reports, or internal wikis.
  
  
  4. How to Develop It (Example Python Code)

  
  
  Creating the embeddings of the PDF and storing on FAISS Vector DB locally

  
  
  Sending embeddings context to AI model for RAG
Once we have the embeddings saved and indexed in FAISS, we can use them to answer user questions more accurately. That’s what we’re doing here.The function  contains a RAG pipeline that:

1. Loads the local FAISS vector store.2. Finds the most relevant chunks based on the user query.3. Builds a clean prompt that includes the context and the question.4. Sends the prompt to a language model (like Phi-2) via an API.5. Gets back a contextualized answer based only on the document content.
  
  
  5. Improving the Code for Better Production Results
Use stronger language models: Upgrade to larger or more capable models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, or other state-of-the-art LLMs) to get more accurate and coherent answers.Improve embedding quality: Use more powerful embedding models like sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2 or OpenAI’s embeddings, which can capture semantic meaning better than smaller models. Use more scalable vector databases such as Pinecone, Weaviate, or Elasticsearch for handling larger datasets with faster retrieval times.Context window management: Implement smarter chunking, token budget management, or retrieval filtering to keep prompts concise but informative.Caching and indexing strategies: Use caching for repeated queries and incremental index updates to improve speed and freshness.Monitoring and evaluation: Continuously monitor output quality and user feedback to identify weaknesses and improve iteratively.These steps help make the RAG system more robust, scalable, and suitable for real-world production use cases.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>String in Python (10)</title><link>https://dev.to/hyperkai/string-in-python-10-2p88</link><author>Super Kai (Kazuya Ito)</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 23:40:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[center() can center the string set  as shown below:The 1st argument is (Required-Type:):

Because it's literally everywhere.Python is used in web development, data science, machine learning, automation, and even artificial intelligence. But what is most appealing — especially for new developers — is how readable it is. The syntax is simple, the learning curve isn't so rough, and some people even joke that it feels like writing in plain English.I started learning JavaScript about ten months ago. Once I honed my fundamentals in JavaScript, I wanted to learn a language that would open more doors and expand my horizon in tech beyond web development. Python kept coming up in conversations — not just because it's powerful, but because people actually enjoy using it.
  
  
  Indentation and Variables
Right off the bat, two things will blow your mind about Python — especially if you're coming from JavaScript.First, Python uses indentation (whitespace) to define code blocks, rather than curly braces  like in JavaScript and many other languages. That means spacing of your code is very important.Compare that to JavaScript:In Python, there's no need for  — the indentation is the structure.Another surprising quirk is how variables are declared. Python doesn't require keywords like , , or . You just write the variable name and assign a value.There's no need to specify types or use extra keywords — Python figures it out for you.Lists in Python are similar to arrays in JavaScript — they can hold multiple values, are ordered, and are mutable (you can change them).They have a very similar syntax, except that:Python typically uses  to declare variables and JavaScript uses .
Python also introduces another built-in data structure called . At first glance, tuples look a lot like lists — they can store an ordered collection of elements — but they come with a few key differences:Tuples are  — meaning once created, their values cannot be changed.More memory-efficient and faster than lists, especially for large, fixed data sets.
Without the comma, Python will treat it as a plain string or number.Python has a useful set of built-in methods you can use on lists and tuples. List methods such as , , , , , etc., allow efficient ways to manipulate and interact with data.Tuples can also be used in real-world scenarios like coordinates or color values - places where you need fixed, unchanging data:Read more about here.Tuples have fewer methods: mainly  and .
  
  
  Conditional Statements and Logical Operators
Python uses  to handle conditional logic.Logical operators in Python: means both conditions must be true. means at least one must be true. inverts the truth value.

  
  
  For Loop and List Comprehension
Python's  loops are super clean:List comprehensions let you build lists in a single line:Try it yourself: Write a list comprehension that returns all even numbers from 0 to 20.
  
  
  Functions and Lambda Functions
Python functions use the  keyword:Lambda functions are one-liner anonymous functions:You’ll often see lambdas used in sorting, mapping, or filtering lists.While Python has a lot going for it — especially its simplicity and readability — it's not without tradeoffs.Python tends to run slower than JavaScript in browser-based environments.It's not the best fit for mobile app development.And because it's dynamically typed, it can lead to unexpected bugs if you're not careful with types.But in many cases, these drawbacks are outweighed by Python's ease of use, massive ecosystem, and wide range of applications — especially in data science and automation.As with any language, it's about choosing the right tool for the job.This blog isn’t meant to cover  about Python — instead, it’s a reflection of what stood out to me as a JavaScript developer learning Python for the first time. These are the things I found quirky, interesting, and surprisingly smooth to work with — like list comprehensions, lambda functions, and Python’s indentation-based style.There’s still  to explore in Python: Modules, Dictionaries, Classes and Object-Oriented Programming, File handling, Error handling… the list goes on.I’m still learning, and I plan to write more as I go deeper. But if you’re curious and want to keep exploring, here are some  that have helped me: — The most accurate and comprehensive reference for Python syntax, features, and standard library modules. A bit dense, but essential for in-depth learning. — Interactive lessons with a built-in coding environment. Excellent if you prefer to learn by doing.Thanks for reading — and if you’re learning Python too, I’d love to hear what surprised or confused  the most.

The issue is that all of these require a bit of code to get your started. For example, assuming you have an API key in your environment like I do, you’ll need at least this code to make an LLM call with OpenAI (also assuming you’re using the older Chat Completions endpoint).And if you want to wrap your API call with a function so you can call it repeatedly, that’s even more lines!And that is simply unacceptable!No, I’m being facetious. For most LLM projects, consistency of output trumps anything else, however sometimes its nice to have a super simple way to add LLMs to my one-off python scripts and tools without all the boilerplate. Magentic is a Python package that lets you create functions that call LLMs in 3 lines of code. No, really! Here’s an example ripped straight from their docs.Thanks to some black box dark magic that I don’t feel like learning about, this is a completely valid Python function that’s callable anywhere in the script, assuming you have an OpenAI API Key in your environment variables.
  
  
  A Note On Package Management
I’m going to be using the PEP 723 standard at the top of all my scripts for the rest of this post. This allows you to use uv, the best package manager for Python, to run the scripts without you having to make a virtual environment, then install packages, then run the script. This automates all three of those tasks into a single command. Here’s an example.Here’s the above script with the added metadata and some slight modifications. This assumes you have uv installed and the  env var set.This script can now be downloaded and ran like an executable. I’ve uploaded to a gist for easy download.wget  dudeify https://gist.githubusercontent.com/chand1012/218372f3e1101dfa7f915dc35c0e66d8/raw/363f720d21fa8ebe2e6a484f6b389496c3452064/dudeify.py
 +x dudeify
./dudeify The first time you run the script it’ll handle making a cached virtual environment for the next time you run it! For more information on how this works, you can check out the uv docs, and the blog post that inspired my constant use of this feature.If you want to have structured outputs, like for example for an API response or just to make it easier to parse and use the data with your scripts, you can use a Pydantic Dataclass.Here’s an example of that method being ran.
  
  
  Prompting and Function Calls
There’s two ways you can prompt the LLM with Magentic. You can either use the  decorator, as I’ve been using, which is the simplest and fastest way to create LLM methods. There’s also , which allows you to pass a list of chat messages to the LLM. This is especially useful for few-shot prompting, where you give the LLM some examples of what output you want. After all, LLMs  just fancy pattern matching black boxes.You can also pass function calls to LLMs to allow them to return a python callable that you can call later. Another use of this is the decorator  which allows you to have an LLM call a function and use the returned results to generate its response.If you’re a data conscious person, or just want your options to be open, Magentic can be configured to work with nearly all other LLMs as long as they are supported by LiteLLM or offer an OpenAI compatible API. Here’s an example of a script that runs entirely locally using Ollama and Google’s Gemma 3.You can use the LiteLLM method to use Anthropic’s Claude series of models, or you can use Magentic’s official Anthropic extension.Need an async function? Just prefix with  instead of  !You can use Python’s  to make multiple simultaneous calls to the LLM.Need to stream the response back to the user? Use Magentic’s  to loop through the response chunks.This also works for multiple objects, simply wrap your objects in the  class.Working with LLMs is now easier than ever, and Magnetic makes it even easier than the standard methods to quick add LLMs to any Python script, regardless of the scale of complexity. Using this in tandem with something like uv and the new scripting metadata allows you to quickly make command line tools that can utilize AI quickly and effectively. I won’t always use Magentic for every project I need an LLM for, but I’ll definitely use it all the time with my small one-offs and utilities.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Set Up a Django Project Structure Using VS Code</title><link>https://dev.to/annnab2222/how-to-set-up-a-django-project-structure-using-vs-code-3189</link><author>Hannah</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 18:55:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you're just getting started with Django and want to build your project using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), you're in the right place. In this guide, I’ll walk you through setting up a clean Django project structure from scratch using VS Code — perfect for beginners and those who want a solid foundation for scalable web apps.
Before l dive in, make sure you have the following installed:📁 Step 1: Create Your Project Folder.
Open VS Code and create a new folder;`mkdir my_django_project
cd my_django_project
after the creating this how they will look like;🧪Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment
Virtual environments are essential in Python development—especially for Django projects. Each Python project might require different versions of packages. A virtual environment keeps dependencies isolated so that one project’s requirements don’t interfere with another’s.
we need to Create and activate a virtual environment;python -m venv env
# On Windows
env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source env/bin/activate
📦Step 3: Install Django.
Once your virtual environment is activated, the next step is to install Django — the powerful web framework that will power your project.
Install Django using pip;After install it look like this;then after that run the server python manage.py runserverthen it click the link and it brings success of install of django 🚀Step 4: Start a New Django ProjectNow create your Django project`django-admin startproject <project_name>`


Your folder structure should now look like this:my_django_project/
├── config/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── asgi.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
├── manage.py
└── env/

Step 5: Create a Django AppInstalled the required django apps l used command to create the apps which they were two apps;Now your structure will look like this ;but for the second app this how structure will look like;Each app will have its own views and templates. Here’s how to link them and display two templates from each.
`blog/

└── templates/
        ├── home.html``In Django, URLs are how you connect your web browser to specific views in your app. Think of them as the road signs that tell Django which view to display when someone visits a certain page. 
this how it look like;In Django, HTML is used to build the templates that define how your web pages look. These templates are combined with data from your views to create dynamic, interactive websites.l added them this how it look liked;Now you can run the project and see how it look;python manage.py runserverthis how it will look like;In this guide, we walked through the full process of setting up a Django project using Visual Studio Code. Here's a quick recap of what we covered:✅ Creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies✅ Installing Django and verifying the installation✅ Starting a new Django project and creating multiple apps✅ Setting up views, templates, and URL routing for each app✅ Understanding how HTML works within Django templatesDjango is incredibly powerful once you get the hang of it—and the best way to learn is by building.Got questions, stuck somewhere, or want to share what you built?

  Day Four of My Django Bootcamp: Crafting the Structure of My Django Project
Today is the fourth day of my Django bootcamp, and it has been an exciting journey so far! I focused on creating and structuring my Django project while learning a lot about apps, templates, and URL configurations. Here’s a friendly walkthrough of how I accomplished it using Git Bash as my terminal.1. Starting the Django Project 🚀
The first step was to create a new Django project named . This project would serve as the foundation for everything else. Using Git Bash, I navigated to my desired directory and set up a virtual environment:dijango
dijango
python  venv venv
venv/bin/activate  
venvcriptsctivate   Next, I installed Django and created the project:pip django
django-admin startproject dijango Here’s what the structure looked like at this point:: The project’s control center.: A directory containing core files like , , and others. 🛠️
Django encourages splitting functionality into smaller units called apps. I created two apps,  and , to separate different functionalities:python manage.py startapp REE1
python manage.py startapp REE2
Each app came with its own files, like  and . To make Django recognize these apps, I added them to the  section in :Templates define how the front-end of the app looks. Using Git Bash, I created a  directory in the root folder and added subfolders for each app:templates
templates/REE1
templates/REE2
In , I updated the  configuration to include the new directory:URL configurations connect specific views to URLs. Since Django doesn’t create  files for apps by default, I manually added them for  and .I then updated the main project’s  to include these app-specific routes:5. Adding Views and Templates 🖼️
In Django, views determine what gets displayed for each URL. I created simple views for both apps:Next, I added basic HTML templates:templates/REE1/index.html:REE1 IndexWelcome to REE1!:REE2 HomeWelcome to REE2!Using Git Bash throughout this process made it easy to execute commands and navigate between directories. As I continue exploring Django, I look forward to building more complex projects and honing my skills. If you’re on a similar journey, let’s connect and share our progress!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Come along for 20 days of deep Django learning experience with me</title><link>https://dev.to/nyambura20/come-along-for-20-days-of-deep-django-learning-experience-with-me-4efa</link><author>Sarah Nyambura Kiiru</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 18:19:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[: How I understood and practiced about the structure of Django
The first thing is to understand what a structure is.is the organized way in which parts of something are arranged or built.It helps one to understand where things belong and maintain one's project as it grows helping in collaboration without confusion.To be able to have a project structured in the Django style you run the following command to start the project.django-admin startproject <project_name>
This is how the project structure will look like afterwards:my_project/
    manage.py 
    my_project/
 - It is a command-line utility used to runserver, migrations etc (directory with the same name as your project) - This directory contains the project-wide settings and configurations. The files it contained are as below:my_project/
    __init__.py
    settings.py
    urls.py
    asgi.py

 - This empty file tells Python to treat the directory as a package. It's necessary for importing files across different modules something you'll do a lot in Django projects. - Contains all the configuration settings for your Django project, such as installed apps, middleware, database settings, static file paths, and more. - Acts as the "table of contents" for your site. It defines how URLs are routed to views — basically deciding what happens when someone visits a specific page. - Entry point for ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface), which allows your Django app to support asynchronous features like WebSockets and background tasks. -     Entry point for WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface), which helps traditional web servers like Gunicorn or uWSGI serve your Django project. This is what powers your site in most production environments. Something to note is to ensure you have created a virtual environment in VS code so as to start the django project
You need to run the server so that to make sure the project runs(a rocket like thing will be displayed in the browser to confirm that)python manage.py runserver
In order to get to practice on the django structure I created two applications for my day1 learning of django:  and  apps 
To be able to create the apps I used:python manage.py startapp journal
python manage.py startapp about 
Each app contains files and a folder which are: - Configuration for the Django admin interface. - Configuration for the app itself. - Contains the database models for the app. - Contains tests for the app. - Contains the request/response logic for the app. - Contains database migrations for the app. Then I registered the 2 apps in the  file For the 2 apps I created a folder templates for each.For the about app the template folder contained an about folder that has an  file
   For the journal app the template folder contained an journal folder that has an  filein the settings.py had to tell Django where to find the template: BASE_DIR / ,Then routed the URL so that the templates to be visible in the browser
I did this by creating file for each app and linking it from  file of each app For The whole project URL fileI then started the developer server 
and used this link for me to get results http://127.0.0.1:8000/journal/diary_entries/
http://127.0.0.1:8000/about/about_me/My project about creating a diary was complete I had some challenges but got through but did not stop me from proceeding.
This diary apps enabled me to get to understand how the Django structure works.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Introducing the Three Versions of TextCleaner: free , pro, and Pro Enhanced</title><link>https://dev.to/nova_soft_d42c9d58573e2a4/introducing-the-three-versions-of-textcleaner-free-pro-and-pro-enhanced-152h</link><author>Nova Soft</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 18:06:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I’m excited to introduce the different versions of TextCleaner, a Python-based desktop tool designed to clean messy text files by removing HTML tags, emojis, weird symbols, and more.Here’s a quick overview of the three editions:Removes HTML tags, emojis, and strange charactersNo installation needed — just run the .exeIncludes all Lite featuresAdds advanced cleaning options like regex supportAllows batch processing of multiple filesAll Standard features plus:In-depth text analysis and comparison toolsCustomizable cleaning workflowsSupports Arabic and multiple languagesFeel free to try any version that fits your needs!

Later i had to activate the enviroment using;This is an image after i have created and activated the virtual enviroment it created a folder named env.This is are the folders that are created after installing Django, they are created on the env folder.Start a project
I used this since i wanted my project to be called waste_sorter ;django-admin startproject waste_sorter This are the project settings and configurations installed.checking if my project was working
I had to run my project using;python manage.py runserver
follow the link provide and you should see this;1.init.py- Makes the folder a Python package .
2.settings.py-Contains all configurations: database, apps, templates, static files, etc.
3.urls.py-Controls which page shows whatand also connects URLs to views.
4.asgi.py-Used for advanced or real-time features and also handles asynchronous requests.
5.wsgi.py-Used to connect Django to a web server and handles normal (synchronous) requests.In this case i started my app and i had 2 of them  using  the command;python manage.py startapp app_name
here is an image both apps i created;admin.py: Configuration for the Django admin interface.apps.py: Configuration for the app itself. models.py: Contains the database models for the app.tests.py: Contains tests for the app.views.py: Contains the request/response logic for the app.migrations/: Contains database migrations for the app.

so that my apps could be recognized ,i opened the settings.py and added the apps on the INSTALLED_APPS.
  
  
  writing views and creating urls
this are the codes that i wrote, i had two since the apps are two;
  
  
  Step 7 created Urls for both apps
I created new files and made them "urls.py" under each app.
This is where i had to join bothof the urls that i created to the main project.
This is what it looked like;Adding Templates 
This this the folder that shall be kholding all my pages.
Example of one of my pages ;Checking if the project is Running ;
i used thepython manage.py runserver
then follow the link to the browser .For me i got this;
Starting a Django project the right way sets the foundation for a scalable, maintainable, and efficient web application.The images and step-by-step instructions demonstrate how each component fits together, from the initial runserver check to rendering dynamic templates. Whether you’re building a simple app like "WASTE SOROR" or a complex system, Django’s flexibility and structure empower you to focus on functionality rather than boilerplate.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I built a free text cleaning tool to remove emojis, HTML tags, and symbols — no install required</title><link>https://dev.to/nova_soft_d42c9d58573e2a4/i-built-a-free-text-cleaning-tool-to-remove-emojis-html-tags-and-symbols-no-install-required-5c39</link><author>Nova Soft</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 17:46:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Don't forget to follow me on Medium and show your support. Thank you! Your support means the world! Python's concurrency and parallelism capabilities transform how we handle modern computing challenges. When applications slow down during network calls or intensive calculations, I implement these strategies to optimize performance. Let me share practical approaches that work effectively in production environments.Thread pools excel when dealing with multiple I/O operations. I often use them for web scraping or file processing tasks. The  module simplifies managing worker threads:For CPU-intensive workloads like mathematical computations, process pools bypass Python's Global Interpreter Lock. I recently used this for data preprocessing:Asynchronous I/O revolutionized how I build network services. The  framework handles thousands of connections in a single thread. Here's how I implement API clients:Synchronization prevents nasty race conditions. I always use context managers with locks for shared resources:Shared memory optimizes data exchange between processes. I use  for numerical workflows:Deadlock prevention saves countless debugging hours. I enforce strict lock acquisition orders:For debugging concurrency issues, I rely on tracing tools.  generates invaluable visualizations:viztracer  performance_test.py
Queues enable robust producer-consumer architectures. I implement them for data pipelines:
  
  
  These techniques form the foundation of high-performance Python systems. I choose thread pools for I/O operations, process pools for heavy computations, and async I/O for network-intensive applications. Synchronization primitives maintain data integrity, while shared memory and queues enable efficient communication. Debugging tools and lock management strategies prevent elusive concurrency issues. Each approach serves specific scenarios—mastering them provides comprehensive solutions for modern performance challenges.

Don't forget to follow me on Medium and show your support. Thank you! Your support means the world! Efficient machine learning inference separates promising prototypes from production-ready systems. I've spent years wrestling with latency spikes and resource constraints across edge devices, cloud instances, and embedded systems. These eight Python techniques consistently deliver performance gains while preserving accuracy.  Model quantization reduces numerical precision to shrink memory footprint. Converting 32-bit floats to 16-bit or 8-bit integers accelerates calculations with minimal accuracy loss. In one deployment, this cut inference time by 60% on mobile processors. Here's practical TensorFlow implementation:Pruning eliminates redundant neural connections. I approach this as iterative sculpting - gradually removing low-weight connections during training. Sparsity patterns emerge naturally, like finding efficient pathways through dense forests:Batching strategies maximize hardware utilization. Grouping requests leverages parallel processing capabilities. I implement dynamic batching that adapts to fluctuating loads:ONNX Runtime provides hardware-agnostic acceleration. Switching execution providers lets me optimize for specific environments. This snippet shows how I configure sessions for different hardware:Apache TVM compiles models to hardware-native code. Ahead-of-time compilation generates optimized executables. I use this for deploying to edge devices with limited resources:Asynchronous pipelines separate I/O from computation. This design pattern overlaps preprocessing with model execution. My implementation handles concurrent requests efficiently:Knowledge distillation transfers capabilities to smaller models. I train compact student models using guidance from larger teacher models. This technique maintains accuracy while reducing computational demands:Monitoring production systems detects performance degradation. Statistical tests identify data drift and model decay. I implement continuous validation with this approach:These techniques form a comprehensive toolkit for inference optimization. Each addresses specific constraints I've encountered in real-world deployments. Quantization excels on mobile processors, while TVM shines in cross-compilation scenarios. Asynchronous patterns prove invaluable in high-throughput APIs, and distillation creates efficient specialized models. Performance monitoring completes the lifecycle, ensuring sustained accuracy.  The most effective solutions combine multiple approaches. I typically start with quantization and pruning during model export, then layer hardware-specific optimizations like TVM compilation. For server deployments, I implement batching and asynchronous pipelines. Edge deployments benefit most from quantization and TVM. Continuous monitoring provides safety nets for all scenarios.  
  
  
  Through careful implementation, I've achieved latency reductions up to 85% compared to baseline implementations. Resource consumption often drops to one-third of original requirements. These gains enable applications previously considered impractical - real-time video analysis on IoT devices, high-frequency trading predictions, and responsive medical diagnostics. The Python ecosystem provides robust tools, but thoughtful architecture determines ultimate performance.

As a developer who loves a good retro arcade game and is curious about AI-driven development, this was the perfect excuse to dive in. The mission was simple: build a game using Amazon Q's command-line interface, document the journey, and share the results.The result? A fully-functional, nostalgic side-scrolling shooter called , and a ton of insights into pairing AI with a classic coding project. Here’s how it went down.
  
  
  My Game: "Space Conquer" - A Modern-Classic Shooter
For my project, I chose to build , a side-scrolling space shooter inspired by the classic  from old Nokia phones. Like many, I have fond memories of playing . I wanted to capture that simple, addictive fun but with a modern coat of paint—better graphics, dynamic sound, and smoother controls. A 2D shooter involves a fantastic mix of programming challenges that are perfect for an AI assistant: managing game states, handling real-time user input, collision detection, and creating varied enemy behaviors. I didn't just want to build a game; I wanted to build a . My vision was a modular design where new enemies, power-ups, or levels could be added easily. This is where an AI's ability to generate structured, boilerplate code would really shine.Space Conquer features diverse enemies, collectible power-ups, dynamic audio that changes with the game state, and even a hidden developer panel for testing.
  
  
  Unlocking AI's Potential: Effective Prompting Techniques
Working with Amazon Q CLI is a conversation. The better your questions, the better the answers. I quickly learned that vague prompts like "make a game" were less effective than breaking down the problem into specific, well-defined tasks.Here are a few prompting techniques I discovered.
  
  
  Technique 1: Requesting a Modular Architecture
Instead of asking for a single, monolithic script, I prompted for a clean, organized structure from the start. "Create a project structure for a PyGame-based space shooter. I need separate modules for asset management, sprites (player, enemies, bullets), UI components, and the main game loop. The asset manager should load images and sounds from manifest files." Amazon Q generated a directory structure (, , ) and starter Python files for each module (, , , ). The generated  included a function to read a JSON manifest, which was a huge head start.
  
  
  Technique 2: Defining Behavior with Roles and Rules
When creating enemies, I defined their characteristics and constraints clearly. "Generate a Python class  that inherits from . It needs attributes for health, speed, and score value. Then, create a subclass  that moves in a sine wave pattern down the screen and fires a bullet every 2 seconds." Q provided a base  class and a well-defined  subclass with its  method already implementing the sine wave movement using . This saved me from figuring out the trigonometry and timing loops myself.
  
  
  How AI Handled Classic Programming Challenges
Game development is full of recurring problems. Here's how Amazon Q helped tackle some of the classics: A game needs distinct states like 'main_menu', 'gameplay', 'settings', and 'game_over'. I prompted the AI to implement a simple state machine. It generated a  class that held the current state and handled transitions, ensuring that the main menu logic didn't run during gameplay and vice-versa. A core mechanic of any shooter. I asked Q for an efficient way to check for collisions between player bullets and enemies, and between the player and enemy ships or bullets. It suggested using PyGame's built-in pygame.sprite.groupcollide() function, providing a concise and performant solution that I could drop right into my main game loop. I wanted power-ups to drop randomly from destroyed asteroids. I prompted: "When an asteroid is destroyed, there should be a 15% chance of it dropping a power-up. The power-up type (health, speed, rapid-fire) should be chosen randomly." The AI generated a clean if random.random() < 0.15: check and a  call to select from a list of power-up types.
  
  
  Time-Saving Automation: More Than Just Code
One of the biggest wins was using AI for automation  the code. The project summary mentions developer tools, and Q was instrumental here.
  
  
  The Asset Manifest Generator
My game uses JSON files to manage all assets (images, sounds, maps). Manually keeping these in sync is tedious. "Write a Python script for the  directory that scans the  and  directories and automatically generates a  file with all the file paths."This single prompt created a utility script that saved me countless minutes of error-prone manual editing every time I added a new enemy sprite or sound effect.
  
  
  The Cross-Platform Launcher
I wanted a simple way for anyone to run the game, regardless of their OS. "Create a Python script named  that checks the user's operating system. It should ensure all dependencies from  are installed using pip and then launch the  script."Q generated a script using the  and  modules that provided a one-click experience—a small but professional touch that I might have skipped otherwise.
  
  
  AI-Generated Code That Impressed Me
It's one thing to generate boilerplate, but another to produce elegant solutions. Here are a couple of snippets that stood out.
  
  
  1. Manifest-Driven Asset Loader
This function, generated early on, set the foundation for the game's modularity. It loads all assets listed in a JSON file into a dictionary, making them easily accessible throughout the game.This design is clean, error-handled, and makes adding 50 new assets as easy as adding one.A Base Class for Animated UI Panels
I wanted the UI to have a modern, "glowing" feel. I asked Q to create a reusable class for this.
# Part of src/ui.py
import pygame

class GlowingPanel(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    """
    A UI panel that has a subtle pulsing glow effect by alpha blending.
    """
    def __init__(self, rect, color, glow_color):
        super().__init__()
        self.rect = rect
        self.color = color
        self.glow_color = glow_color
        self.image = pygame.Surface(self.rect.size, pygame.SRCALPHA)

        self.glow_alpha = 100
        self.glow_direction = 2 # Rate of change for alpha

    def update(self):
        """Update the pulsing glow effect."""
        self.glow_alpha += self.glow_direction
        if self.glow_alpha >= 180 or self.glow_alpha <= 80:
            self.glow_direction *= -1

        self.image.fill((0, 0, 0, 0)) # Clear with transparency

        # Draw base panel
        pygame.draw.rect(self.image, self.color, (0, 0, self.rect.width, self.rect.height), border_radius=8)

        # Draw glow effect (a slightly larger rect with changing alpha)
        glow_surface = pygame.Surface(self.rect.size, pygame.SRCALPHA)
        glow_rect = pygame.Rect(0, 0, self.rect.width, self.rect.height)
        glow_color_with_alpha = (*self.glow_color, self.glow_alpha)
        pygame.draw.rect(glow_surface, glow_color_with_alpha, glow_rect, border_radius=10)

        # Blit the glow onto the main surface
        self.image.blit(glow_surface, (0,0), special_flags=pygame.BLEND_RGBA_ADD)
This self-contained class for a UI element with its own animation logic is a great example of the object-oriented code Q can produce. It's reusable for scoreboards, health bars, or any other panel in the game.Final Thoughts
Using Amazon Q CLI for the "Build Games" challenge was a fantastic experience. It didn't just write code for me; it acted as a partner that handled the tedious, boilerplate, and sometimes complex parts of development, freeing me up to focus on the creative vision for "Space Conquer."If you're a developer who hasn't tried integrating an AI assistant into your workflow, I highly recommend it. Pick a fun project, break it down into small pieces, and start prompting. You'll be surprised at how much you can build.And hey, I might even get a t-shirt out of it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>day 4: Django structure</title><link>https://dev.to/rebecca254/day-4-django-structure-2hgj</link><author>Rebecca-254</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 14:57:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello, today marks my 4th day in my journey of developers. Am quite excited to share what I did today while learning Django structure.
  
  
  step 1; setting up my project.
As part of my tech journey, I decided to build a Django project to practice web development. I named my project njeriproject. Here’s how I got started:
django-admin startproject njeriproject
cd njeriproject
python -m venv rbenv
rbenv\Scripts\activate
pip install django
in this i created a virtual environment by the name brenv and installed django.
Then I created two apps inside it:
  
  
  Step 2: Understanding the Django Structure
After running the command, my project looked like this:njeri/
├── manage.py
├── mysite/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   ├── asgi.py
│   └── wsgi.py

I explored and learned what each file does:- This lets me run commands like runserver or makemigrations- This Contains all project settings like installed apps and database config- Handles all routing and linking to app URLs- Help when deploying to a web server
  
  
  Step 3: Creating Two Django Apps
To organize my site into separate features, I created two apps where each app came with important files like;
views.py, models.py, admin.py, apps.py, tests.py, and a migrations/ folder
  
  
  Step 4: Registering the Apps
To make Django recognize both apps, I opened mysite/settings.py and added them in INSTALLED_APPS 
  
  
  Step 5: Writing Views and Creating URLs

In app1/views.py i created this codefrom django.shortcuts import render

def app1_home(request):
    return render(request, 'app1_home.html')

then created urls.py for app1 added the following in itfrom django.urls import path
from .views import app1_home

urlpatterns = [
    path('', app1_home, name='app1_home'),
]
** For app2**
In app2/views.py:from django.shortcuts import render

def app2_home(request):
    return render(request, 'app2_home.html')
Then I created app2/urls.py:from django.urls import path
from .views import app2_home

urlpatterns = [
    path('', app2_home, name='app2_home'),
]

  
  
  Step 6: Connecting Both Apps in mysite/urls.py
Now it was time to connect both apps to the main URL configuration.In mysite/urls.py I wrote:from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('app1/', include('app1.urls')),
    path('app2/', include('app2.urls')),
]

At first, I forgot to import include and Django gave me an error. But once I fixed that, the server ran smoothly.
  
  
  Step 7: Adding Templates for HTML Pages
After getting simple text responses to show up using HttpResponse, I wanted to display proper HTML pages using templates.So I created a templates folder inside each app
In both app1 and app2, I made this folder structure:app1/
└── templates/
    └── app1/
        └── home.html
app2/
└── templates/
    └── app2/
        └── home.html
I created basic HTML files in both apps.I updated the views to render templates
In app1/views.py:from django.shortcuts import render

def home(request):
    return render(request, 'app1/home.html')
In app2/views.py:

`from django.shortcuts import render

def home(request):
    return render(request, 'app2/home.html')
I ran the server with the following commandpython manage.py runserverThen I opened my browser and tested. this is what my page looked like after adding /app1 in the URL generated. Seeing both apps work made me feel proud and confident in using Django.Django projects can be modular — I can add many apps like I did with app1 and app2.The outer folder (njeri) holds everything; the inner mysite/ config folder manages settings, URLs, and deployment files.Even small mistakes (like forgetting include) can break the app — but the error messages help a lot
Building the njeri project taught me how Django is structured and how everything connects from creating apps, to writing views, to linking URLs. Working with two apps in one project showed me Django’s power and flexibility.I’m still learning, but now I feel more confident to build real Django websites.

How do you handle different audio lengths, convert sound frequencies into learnable patterns, and make sure your model is robust? This tutorial will show you how to handle audio data using TorchAudio, a PyTorch-based toolkit.You’ll work with real speech data to learn essential techniques like converting waveforms to spectrograms, standardizing audio lengths, and adding controlled noise to build machine and deep learning models.By the end of this tutorial, you’ll understand that: processes audio data for deep learning, including tasks like loading datasets and augmenting data with noise.You can load audio data in  using the  function, which returns a waveform tensor and sample rate. audio by default during loading, scaling waveform amplitudes between -1.0 and 1.0.A  visually represents the frequency spectrum of an audio signal over time, aiding in frequency analysis.You can pad and trim audio in  using torch.nn.functional.pad() and sequence slicing for uniform audio lengths.Dive into the tutorial to explore these concepts and learn how they can be applied to prepare audio data for deep learning tasks using TorchAudio. Test your knowledge with our interactive “Use TorchAudio to Prepare Audio Data for Deep Learning” quiz. You’ll receive a score upon completion to help you track your learning progress:Learn Essential Technical TermsBefore diving into the technical details of audio processing with TorchAudio, take a moment to review some key terms. They’ll help you grasp the basics of working with audio data.A waveform is the visual representation of sound as it travels through air over time. When you speak, sing, or play music, you create vibrations that move through the air as waves. These waves can be captured and displayed as a graph showing how the sound’s pressure changes over time. Here’s an example:A Sample Waveform of a 440 Hz Wave

This is a waveform of a 440 Hz wave, plotted over a short duration of 10 milliseconds (ms). This is called a time-domain representation, showing how the wave’s amplitude changes over time. This waveform shows the raw signal as it appears in an audio editor. The ups and downs reflect changes in loudness. is the strength or intensity of a sound wave—in other words, how loud the sound is to the listener. In the previous image, it’s represented by the height of the wave from its center line.A higher amplitude means a louder sound, while a lower amplitude means a quieter sound. When you adjust the volume on your device, you’re actually changing the amplitude of the audio signal. In digital audio, amplitude is typically measured in decibels (dB) or as a normalized value between -1 and 1. is how many times a sound wave repeats itself in one second, measured in hertz (Hz). For example, a low bass note is a sound wave that repeats slowly, about 50–100 Hz. In contrast, a high-pitched whistle has a wave that repeats much faster, around 2000–3000 Hz.In music, different frequencies create different musical notes. For instance, the A note that musicians use to tune their instruments is exactly 440 Hz. Now, if you were to look at the frequency plot of the 440 Hz waveform from before, here’s what you’d see:A Frequency Domain Plot of a 440 Hz Wave

This plot displays the signal in the , which shows how much of each frequency is present in the sound. The distinct peak at 440 Hz indicates that this is the dominant frequency in the signal, which is exactly what you’d expect from a pure tone. While time-domain plots—like the one you saw earlier—reveal how the sound’s amplitude changes over time, frequency-domain plots help you understand which frequencies make up the sound.The waveform you just explored was from a 440 Hz wave. You’ll soon see that many examples in audio processing also deal with this mysterious frequency. So, what makes it so special? The 440 Hz frequency (A note) is the international standard pitch reference for tuning instruments. Its clear, single-frequency nature makes it great for audio tasks. These include sampling, frequency analysis, and waveform representation.Now that you understand frequency and how it relates to sound waves, you might be wondering how computers actually capture and store these waves. When you record sound digitally, you’re taking snapshots of the audio wave many times per second. Each snapshot measures the wave’s amplitude at that instant. This is called sampling. The number of snapshots taken per second is the , measured in hertz (Hz).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I Built a Tool to Search AI Conversations in 1 Week (With Heavy AI Assistance)</title><link>https://dev.to/d_p_6e7c8572c8febaab6c33d/i-built-a-tool-to-search-ai-conversations-in-1-week-with-heavy-ai-assistance-2elj</link><author>D P</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 13:50:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I had hundreds of AI conversations with Claude and ChatGPT. Valuable code, solutions, and insights were buried in those exports. Sure, I could grep through them with my hacky script (claude_ai_convo_dump_extractor - great name, right?), but I wanted something better.So last week, with AI enthusiastically egging me on that this would be a "great resume project," I built ChatMine.
  
  
  The Twist: AI Built It Too
Here's where it gets meta. I used Claude Code extensively to build ChatMine. Yes, AI helped me build a tool to search AI conversations. 🤖In just one week, I went from idea to working product with:Semantic search using FAISSAutomatic code extractionWeb interface with FastAPIFull CLI with rich output
  
  
  What ChatMine Actually Does
python claude_ai_convo_dump_extractor.py export.json
 ./extracted/
chatmine import-claude claude-export.zip
✓ Imported 312 conversations
✓ Extracted 1,847 code snippets

chatmine search 
Found 5 relevant conversations:
1. March 2024
2. February 2024
...

chatmine code-search 
Found 23 Python async functions across your conversations

chatmine export-conversations  ./searchable/
rg  ./searchable/

  
  
  The Good, The Bad, and The Honest
It actually works! Fully functional with extensive testsSolves a real problem (beyond my hacky grep scripts)Modern Python stack: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Click, FAISSYou can STILL grep the exports, but now with better organizationI don't fully understand some ML libraries I used (FAISS, sentence-transformers)Some advanced features were "suggested" by AI that I couldn't build myselfTests were sometimes written after the code (I know, I know...)AI convinced me this was resume-worthy (it worked - I built it! 😅)This is what AI-assisted development really looks like in 2025You can ship impressive software fastBut you need to be careful about technical debt
  
  
  From Hacky Scripts to Proper Tool
My original claude_ai_convo_dump_extractor was exactly what it sounds like - a script that dumped conversations so I could grep them. ChatMine evolved from that need but added: - SQLite instead of flat files - Find concepts, not just keywords - Automatically extracts and categorizes code - Organized markdown with metadataBut honestly? Sometimes I still just want to grep things, so ChatMine can export everything to markdown files organized by date and platform. Best of both worlds!
  
  
  Key Learnings from AI-Assisted Development

  
  
  1. AI Accelerates, But Doesn't Replace Understanding

  
  
  2. Tests Are Your Safety Net
With 90% test coverage, I can refactor confidently even when I don't fully understand every library:
  
  
  3. Keep Simple Options Available
I'm open-sourcing ChatMine with a few goals: - I need help understanding the ML libraries better - Better than hacky scripts! - Honest case study in AI-assisted developmentThe repo includes a candid README about what I built with AI help vs. what I understand deeply.This experiment taught me that AI-assisted development is powerful but comes with responsibilities:Be honest about what you don't understandTest everything thoroughly
Document for your future selfKeep simple alternatives (sometimes grep is all you need!)Be ready to learn the underlying conceptsHave you built anything with heavy AI assistance? How do you balance speed with understanding? Do you have hacky scripts that could become "proper" tools? (We all do!)And if you're still grepping through AI conversation exports... well, now there's ChatMine! 🎉Currently exploring new opportunities in Python/DevOps.

That’s fine—until it isn’t:Keyword Search Might Return“10 Best  Tables”“Wimbledon Lawn  Highlights”Articles, rules and gear for Keyword engines struggle even more with non-text media: images, audio, video, genome sequences, etc. They simply don’t “see” pixels or sound waves.Vector (semantic) search fixes this by turning each item—text, image, whatever—into a high-dimensional vector. Similar meaning -> nearby vectors. Your query is embedded the same way, and the engine brings back the closest neighbours. Vector search ➜ find things that feel the same, not just things that spell the same.
You start with a set of text passages (in the drawing they’re labelled “Text / Answers”).
Each passage is fed through an embedding model (a neural network that maps text to points in a high-dimensional space).
The model outputs a vector for each passage—these vectors (sometimes called word or sentence embeddings) capture the meaning of the text as coordinates in that space.Query Vectorization & Retrieval
When a user asks a question, you send the question through the same embedding model and obtain a query vector.
You then compare that query vector to all of your stored document vectors (e.g. with cosine similarity).
The documents whose vectors lie closest to the query vector are the most semantically relevant answers, even if they don’t share the exact same keywords. by operating in a continuous vector space rather than matching literal words, you can find passages that “mean the same thing” and surface them to your LLM (or directly to the user). This is the core of semantic (vector) search in Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines.Many open-source vector databases exist; we’ll use  because it’s lightweight, fast, and has a friendly Python client.Installing Qdrant using docker:docker pull qdrant/qdrant

Installing python client libs:
  
  
  Stage 1: Connections and Data Prep
Import the necessary modules to connect to the vector DB , choose the models that would be required based on the need and study the dataset.
  
  
  Stage 2:  Storage and Index Prep
Create a collection (say for a business problem) and add points (data points or documents) into the collection that would be embedded into vectors.Upsert the relevant section of the documents into vector db.
  
  
  Stage 4: Search capability
Provide a search capability to query the documents say based on similarity matches (cosine distance)
  
  
  Stage 5: Query LLM with Vector DB as a RAG

  
  
  Improving with Hybrid Search
No single search technique suits every scenario. Sometimes you need the precision of keywords (exact product codes, player stats, specific names), and other times the flexibility of semantic matching (similar games, related concepts, broader topics). A  strategy blends both:Sparse (keyword) embeddings for exact matches
Dense (semantic) embeddings for meaning-based recall
 (e.g. reciprocal rank fusion) or  (keyword filter → semantic re-rank, or vice versa)Looking up a particular player’s season statistics? A keyword search is ideal.
Hunting for matches that felt like nail-biters? Semantic search surfaces games with similar “excitement vectors.”
  
  
  Hybrid Embedding & Fusion
By storing both sparse and dense vectors in your collection and then combining their scores—either in two passes or via a fusion query—you get the best of both worlds, serving precise queries and broad, semantically rich ones with equal finesse.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Top 10 Sites to Hire Python Developers Remotely in 2025</title><link>https://dev.to/eric_walter/top-10-sites-to-hire-python-developers-remotely-in-2025-44c1</link><author>Eric Walter</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 13:28:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Python is the most used programming language, and its demand is still increasing, especially for remote projects.

It's my first time building a product within a cross-functional team — collaborating daily with front end engineers, product designer, and tech leads. This journey has reshaped how I think, not just about code, but about collaboration, clarity, and ownership.🤝 From Solo Dev to Team Contributor
Before Tunaresq, I often worked solo — picking up tickets, building features, and shipping without much interaction. But working in a real team taught me that alignment comes first. Now, before we start building or updating anything, we sync with our team — especially the front-end — to avoid mismatches and ensure shared understanding.
Writing APIs isn't just about endpoints — it’s about solving product problems. I now ask:Does this API support a real business case?Is the data structure clear, lean, and secure?Are auth, permissions, and edge cases covered?Working with Django and Django REST Framework (DRF), I’ve built APIs for authentication, user profile management, and notification triggers — all tailored to front-end expectations and use-case needs.✅ Redefining "Done"
A task isn’t truly complete until it’s:Integrated successfully by the front-endVerified against product requirementsOnly then do I mark it "done" in Click-up. This process ensures quality and tight integration across the stack.💡 Design Before You Build
For any task expected to take hours, I now invest 25–30% of the time in:Understanding the logic and flowDesigning the API schema or modelPlanning for re-usabilityThis upfront thinking avoids rework and results in cleaner code — especially when working with repetitive structures like user roles or permission-based filtering.📖 Code Reading = Code Leveling
After I complete a task, I make it a habit to read other teammates’ code — not just to review, but to learn. I study how they:Structure  and Handle validation and exceptionsThis has helped me absorb better patterns and gradually improve my own coding standards.🧠 Owning Tasks, Solving Problems
I’ve learned to take full ownership of tasks from start to finish:Debug independently firstWhen stuck, explain what I’ve tried before asking for helpPropose alternatives when I believe something can be improvedFor example, I once saw a way to simplify a notifications endpoint. Instead of just suggesting it, I prototyped the solution and explained its performance benefit — it was adopted.
Right now, I’m actively contributing to Tunaresq’s back-end — building APIs, refining authentication workflows, and aligning closely with the front-end team. Every feature I build is tested in integration, reviewed for clarity, and aligned with product value. I’m still in the journey — improving daily, learning through feedback, and growing into a product-oriented engineer.Collaboration is a skill. Code is better when teams align.Design before you build.

  Augmented Assignment in Production Python: A Deep Dive
In late 2022, a critical bug surfaced in our real-time fraud detection pipeline. The system, built on FastAPI and leveraging Pydantic for data validation, began intermittently flagging legitimate transactions as fraudulent. The root cause? A subtle interaction between Pydantic’s internal data manipulation and augmented assignment (, , etc.) when updating a shared, mutable state within an async worker pool. Specifically, the in-place modification of a list used for feature engineering was leading to race conditions and data corruption. This incident highlighted a critical gap in our understanding of augmented assignment’s behavior, particularly within concurrent and type-sensitive environments. This post details the intricacies of augmented assignment in Python, focusing on production considerations, debugging strategies, and best practices to avoid similar pitfalls.
  
  
  What is "augmented assignment" in Python?
Augmented assignment operators (e.g., , , , , , , , , , , , ) are syntactic sugar for combining an arithmetic or bitwise operation with assignment.  Crucially, they are  always equivalent to the explicit operation followed by assignment.  This behavior is defined in PEP 203 and is tied to the , , etc., methods.  If an object defines an in-place operation method (e.g., ), augmented assignment will invoke that method. Otherwise, it falls back to the equivalent .This distinction is vital.  For mutable objects like lists,  modifies the object in-place, avoiding a new allocation. For immutable objects like integers, the fallback behavior is used, creating a new object.  This difference impacts performance and, as we saw in the fraud detection incident, concurrency.  The typing system, as defined in PEP 484, treats augmented assignment as a special case, allowing for more precise type inference and static analysis.FastAPI Request Handling:  In high-throughput APIs, accumulating request metrics (e.g., latency histograms) often uses augmented assignment to update counters in-place, minimizing allocation overhead.
Async Job Queues (Celery/RQ):  Updating task progress or retry counts within a worker process benefits from the in-place modification offered by augmented assignment.Type-Safe Data Models (Pydantic/Dataclasses):  While Pydantic generally discourages direct mutation, internal operations like updating nested dictionaries or lists within a model can inadvertently use augmented assignment, leading to unexpected behavior if not carefully managed. Accumulating statistics or processing large datasets in a CLI tool often utilizes augmented assignment for efficiency.ML Preprocessing (Pandas/NumPy):  In-place operations on NumPy arrays or Pandas DataFrames using augmented assignment are common for performance optimization, but require careful consideration of data sharing and potential side effects.
  
  
  Integration with Python Tooling
Augmented assignment interacts significantly with Python’s tooling.  Mypy correctly infers types for augmented assignments, providing static type checking.  However, it can sometimes struggle with complex in-place operations on mutable objects, requiring explicit type annotations. Pydantic’s validation and serialization logic can be affected by augmented assignment if mutable default values are used.  Using immutable defaults (e.g.,  instead of ) is a best practice.  Testing code that uses augmented assignment requires careful consideration of state management.  Fixtures should be used to isolate tests and prevent unintended side effects.  As demonstrated by the fraud detection incident, augmented assignment in concurrent code requires synchronization mechanisms (e.g., ) to prevent race conditions. configuration for mypy:
  
  
  Failure Scenarios & Debugging
The fraud detection incident was a prime example of a race condition. Multiple async workers were simultaneously modifying the same list, leading to inconsistent data.  Debugging involved: Adding detailed logging around the augmented assignment operation to track the state of the list. Analyzing the exception traces to identify the point of failure. Using  to step through the code and inspect the state of the variables. Profiling the code to identify performance bottlenecks and areas where contention was occurring.Another common failure is unexpected behavior when an object doesn't define the  method, leading to a new object being created instead of modifying the original in-place. This can cause subtle bugs if the code relies on the original object being mutated.
  
  
  Performance & Scalability
Augmented assignment can significantly improve performance by avoiding unnecessary object allocations. However, excessive in-place modification can lead to increased memory usage and contention in concurrent environments. Use  to benchmark the performance of augmented assignment versus explicit assignment. Identify performance bottlenecks and areas where in-place modification is causing contention. Minimize the use of shared mutable state to reduce the need for synchronization. Limit the number of concurrent workers to reduce contention.Augmented assignment can introduce security vulnerabilities if used with untrusted data. For example, if a user-supplied value is used in an augmented assignment operation on a sensitive object, it could lead to code injection or privilege escalation.  Always validate and sanitize user input before using it in any operation.  Be particularly cautious when deserializing data from untrusted sources.  Write unit tests to verify the correctness of augmented assignment operations.  Test the interaction of augmented assignment with other components of the system.Property-Based Tests (Hypothesis): Use Hypothesis to generate random inputs and verify that the code behaves correctly under a wide range of conditions.  Enforce type safety using mypy. Integrate testing and type validation into the CI/CD pipeline.
  
  
  Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns
 Using mutable default values in function arguments can lead to unexpected behavior with augmented assignment. Assuming augmented assignment always modifies the object in-place. Using augmented assignment in concurrent code without proper synchronization.Overuse of In-Place Modification:  Excessive in-place modification can lead to increased memory usage and contention.  Failing to use type hints can make it difficult to reason about the behavior of augmented assignment.
  
  
  Best Practices & Architecture
  Always use type hints to improve code clarity and prevent errors.  Prefer immutable data structures whenever possible.  Separate data manipulation logic from business logic.  Validate and sanitize all user input.  Design code in a modular way to improve testability and maintainability.  Automate testing, type validation, and deployment.Augmented assignment is a powerful feature of Python, but it requires careful consideration, especially in production environments. Understanding its nuances, potential pitfalls, and interactions with other tools is crucial for building robust, scalable, and maintainable systems.  Refactor legacy code to use immutable data structures where appropriate, measure performance to identify bottlenecks, write comprehensive tests, and enforce type safety to mitigate risks.  Mastering augmented assignment is not just about knowing the syntax; it’s about understanding the underlying CPython internals and designing systems that leverage its benefits while avoiding its potential drawbacks.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Deploy Your FastAPI App on Vercel: The Complete Guide</title><link>https://dev.to/highflyer910/deploy-your-fastapi-app-on-vercel-the-complete-guide-27c0</link><author>Thea</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 12:09:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[So I was working on this FastAPI project last week and needed to deploy it somewhere. I tried a few different platforms, but Vercel turned out to be simple, much easier than I expected!Your FastAPI app(obviously)That's it. No need for complicated server setup or Docker stuff.First, make sure your FastAPI app is working. Here's my simple example:Pretty straightforward, right?You need a  file so Vercel knows what packages to install:fastapi==0.104.1
uvicorn==0.24.0
Important: Always pin your versions! Trust me, I learned this the hard way when my app broke because of package updates.This part is a bit tricky, but not too bad. Create a  file in your project root:This tells Vercel, "hey, this is a Python app, run it like this".Vercel works with ASGI apps (FastAPI is ASGI), but you need to add this:git init
git add 
git commit 
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
git push  origin main
Go to the Vercel dashboardVercel detects it's Python automaticallyAnd... that's it! No server configuration, no SSL certificates, nothing complicated.If you prefer the command line (like me):
npm  vercel


vercel login


vercel
Three commands and you're done!
  
  
  Auto-deployment with GitHub Actions
Want to deploy automatically when you push code? Here's the workflow file:After deployment, check these URLs:https://your-app.vercel.app/ - Main pagehttps://your-app.vercel.app/api/health - Health checkhttps://your-app.vercel.app/docs - FastAPI docs (this is a cool feature!)
  
  
  Things I learned (the hard way)
Vercel gives you HTTPS automatically - no need to worry about certificatesEnvironment variables are easy to add in the Vercel dashboardEvery push to main branch = new deploymentUse  prefix for your routes. Vercel likes it better, especially when you have frontend + backend togetherDon't worry, it happens to everyone:Check build logs in the Vercel dashboard - they usually show what's wrongLook at your , missing packages cause most problemsVerify your  configurationTest locally first. If it doesn't work on your computer, it won't work on VercelThat's it! Your FastAPI app is now running on Vercel's servers worldwide. No need to manage servers or worry about hosting costs (unless you become popular, but that's a good problem to have 😄).
The whole process takes maybe 10-15 minutes once you know what you're doing. Pretty good for getting your API online, I think!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Real Python: Quiz: Use TorchAudio to Prepare Audio Data for Deep Learning</title><link>https://realpython.com/quizzes/python-torchaudio/</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[You’ll revisit fundamental terminology and how to:Install and import TorchAudioLoad audio waveform datasetsWork through these questions to check your knowledge about building audio workflows for machine learning in Python.]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
