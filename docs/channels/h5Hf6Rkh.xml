  The Humble Counter: A Deep Dive into Production-Grade Implementation
In late 2022, a seemingly innocuous bug in our internal data pipeline nearly brought down our A/B testing infrastructure. The root cause? A  object, used to track feature flag exposure, silently overflowed its maximum value due to an unexpected surge in traffic. This wasn’t a simple integer overflow; it was a consequence of using a naive implementation of a counter within a heavily concurrent, async environment. The incident highlighted a critical truth: even the most basic data structures require careful consideration when deployed at scale. This post dives deep into the world of  in Python, moving beyond the basics to explore its nuances in production systems, focusing on performance, reliability, and best practices.  The relevance is paramount in modern Python ecosystems – from high-throughput web APIs to complex data pipelines and machine learning workflows, accurate counting is fundamental.
  
  
  2. What is "Counter" in Python?
The  class, found in the  module, is a specialized dictionary subclass designed for counting hashable objects.  It’s not defined by a PEP directly, but its functionality is well-documented (https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter).  Internally, it leverages a standard Python dictionary to store element counts.  However, it provides convenient methods like , , and arithmetic operations for combining counters.From a typing perspective,  is generic: , where  is the type of the hashable objects being counted.  This type hinting is crucial for static analysis with .  While the CPython implementation is efficient for many use cases, it’s important to understand its limitations, particularly regarding concurrency and potential overflow issues with the underlying integer representation.Here are several production scenarios where  proves invaluable:FastAPI Request Rate Limiting:  We use  to track requests per user within a sliding window.  This allows us to enforce rate limits and prevent abuse.  The  is reset periodically by an async task.Async Job Queue Monitoring:  In a Celery-based system,  tracks the number of successful, failed, and pending tasks per queue. This provides real-time visibility into job processing health.Type-Safe Data Models (Pydantic):  When validating large datasets,  can efficiently determine the frequency of invalid data types, helping identify schema issues.CLI Tool Argument Parsing:  Counting the occurrences of specific command-line flags or options.ML Preprocessing Feature Frequency:  Calculating the frequency of categorical features during data preprocessing for machine learning models. This informs feature engineering and model selection.
  
  
  4. Integration with Python Tooling
 integrates seamlessly with Python’s tooling ecosystem.  Type hinting  is essential for static analysis.  A  might include:
  Testing  logic requires careful consideration of concurrency.  We use  for testing async counter implementations. can be used within Pydantic models to represent counts, benefiting from Pydantic’s validation and serialization capabilities.  Logging counter values at different stages of a pipeline helps with debugging and monitoring.  While not directly integrated,  can be a field within a dataclass, providing a structured way to manage counts.  Crucially, concurrent access to a  requires synchronization mechanisms (see section 6).
  
  
  5. Code Examples & Patterns
Here's a production-safe example of an async rate limiter using  and :This pattern uses a dictionary of  objects, one per user, to track requests within a sliding window. The  ensures thread-safety.  Configuration is typically loaded from environment variables or a configuration file (YAML or TOML).
  
  
  6. Failure Scenarios & Debugging
Several things can go wrong with : Concurrent access without proper synchronization leads to incorrect counts.  The example above mitigates this with .  If the counter exceeds the maximum integer value, it wraps around, leading to incorrect results.  This was the root cause of our production incident.  Using a larger integer type (e.g.,  in Python 2, or relying on Python 3’s arbitrary-precision integers) can help, but doesn’t eliminate the risk entirely.  Accessing a non-existent key without handling it.  If the objects being counted are not hashable, a  will be raised.  Log counter values at critical points.  Use  to inspect the counter’s state during runtime.  Analyze exception traces to identify the source of the error.  Profile the code to identify performance bottlenecks.A typical traceback for a race condition might look like this (simplified):Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "...", line 25, in allow_request
    self.request_counts[user_id][self.time_window] += 1
  File "/usr/lib/python3.11/collections.py", line 459, in __setitem__
    self.data[key] = value
RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration

  
  
  7. Performance & Scalability
  Global  objects become bottlenecks under high concurrency.  Use per-process or per-thread counters.  Frequent counter updates can lead to memory allocations.  Consider using a more efficient data structure if performance is critical.  Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms (locks, semaphores) to manage concurrent access.  For extremely high-performance counting, consider writing a C extension.Benchmarking with  and  is crucial.  For example:
  
  
  8. Security Considerations
Insecure Deserialization: If a  is serialized and deserialized from untrusted sources, it could be vulnerable to code injection attacks.  Avoid deserializing  objects from untrusted sources.  An attacker could flood the system with unique keys, causing the  to consume excessive memory.  Implement rate limiting and input validation.
  
  
  9. Testing, CI & Validation
  Test individual counter operations (increment, decrement, most_common).  Test the counter’s interaction with other components.Property-Based Tests (Hypothesis):  Generate random counter operations to test for edge cases.  Ensure type correctness.A  setup might include:CI/CD pipelines should include  checks,  runs, and potentially static analysis tools.
  
  
  10. Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns
Using a  without Synchronization:  Leads to race conditions.Ignoring Integer Overflow:  Results in incorrect counts.Counting Unhashable Objects:  Raises a .Over-Reliance on :  Can be inefficient for large counters.Modifying a  During Iteration:  Raises a .
  
  
  11. Best Practices & Architecture
  Always type hint  objects.  Encapsulate counter logic within dedicated classes or modules.  Handle potential errors (e.g., , ).  Design counters as reusable components.  Load counter parameters from configuration files.  Inject dependencies (e.g., locks) into counter classes.  Use  or  to automate testing and deployment.  Use Docker to ensure consistent builds.  Provide clear documentation and examples.The  class, while seemingly simple, is a powerful tool that requires careful consideration in production environments.  Mastering its nuances – concurrency, overflow, and integration with the broader Python ecosystem – is crucial for building robust, scalable, and maintainable systems.  Don’t underestimate the importance of thorough testing, performance profiling, and adherence to best practices.  Refactor legacy code that uses naive counter implementations, measure performance under load, write comprehensive tests, and enforce type checking to unlock the full potential of this humble yet essential data structure.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Python Fundamentals: @staticmethod</title><link>https://dev.to/devopsfundamentals/python-fundamentals-staticmethod-54jh</link><author>DevOps Fundamental</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 17:41:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
  
  
  The Quiet Power of : Production Lessons from the Trenches
In late 2022, a critical data pipeline in our fraud detection system experienced intermittent failures. The root cause wasn’t a database outage or a network hiccup, but a subtle race condition within a utility function used for feature engineering. This function, intended to be purely computational and independent of instance state, was incorrectly implemented as an instance method.  The implicit  argument, even when unused, introduced a lock contention point when multiple asynchronous workers attempted to call it concurrently.  This incident highlighted a fundamental truth: seemingly innocuous language features like  are crucial for building robust, scalable Python applications, especially in cloud-native environments.  This post dives deep into , moving beyond textbook definitions to explore its practical implications in production systems, focusing on architecture, performance, and debugging.
  
  
  What is "@staticmethod" in Python?
 is a decorator that transforms a method within a class into a function bound to the class itself, rather than to an instance of the class.  PEP 105 defines it as a way to define methods that are logically related to the class but don’t require access to instance-specific data.  Technically, it doesn’t enforce any access restrictions; it’s a semantic marker.  CPython’s method table lookup handles  differently than instance methods or class methods (). Instance methods receive the instance () as the first argument, while  receives no implicit first argument.  This distinction is critical for performance and concurrency.  From a typing perspective,  doesn’t alter the function’s signature; it’s purely a runtime behavior modifier.  Tools like  treat it as a regular function within the class namespace.FastAPI Request Validation:  We use  extensively in FastAPI applications for request body validation.  Instead of tying validation logic to a specific instance of a data model, we define static methods that perform schema validation using Pydantic. This keeps the validation logic separate from the model’s core data representation and allows for easy reuse across different endpoints.
 In our asynchronous task queue (built on Celery and Redis),  is used for utility functions that process data without needing access to the worker’s state.  For example, a function to normalize a string or calculate a hash.  This avoids unnecessary context switching and improves throughput.  When building complex data models with Pydantic or similar libraries,  is used for factory methods that create instances with specific configurations or default values. This ensures type safety and reduces boilerplate.  In our internal CLI tools,  is used for functions that perform command-line argument parsing or file system operations.  These functions are logically associated with the CLI class but don’t require access to the CLI’s internal state.  In our machine learning pipelines,  is used for data preprocessing steps like feature scaling or one-hot encoding. These steps are often stateless and can be efficiently executed in parallel.
  
  
  Integration with Python Tooling
 integrates seamlessly with most Python tooling.   doesn’t require special handling, treating the decorated method as a regular function.  However, it’s crucial to type-hint the function signature correctly.   can test  methods directly without needing to instantiate the class.   models can leverage  for custom validation logic.Here's a  snippet demonstrating our typical configuration:We enforce strict type checking with  to catch potential errors related to  usage, particularly incorrect type hints.  We also use  hooks to run  and  on every commit.Consider a geometric shape class:This example demonstrates a clear separation of concerns. The  and  calculations are logically related to the  class but don’t require access to a specific  instance.  Calling them as  is more explicit and readable than creating an instance just to call the method.
  
  
  Failure Scenarios & Debugging
A common mistake is accidentally accessing instance state within a . This can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug errors.  For example:Debugging such issues requires careful examination of the traceback and understanding the scope of variables.  Using  or a debugger within your IDE is essential.  Runtime assertions can also help catch these errors early:
  
  
  Performance & Scalability
 offers a slight performance advantage over instance methods because it avoids the overhead of instance lookup and method binding.  However, the difference is usually negligible unless the method is called millions of times.  The real performance benefit comes from avoiding unnecessary context switching and lock contention, as demonstrated in the initial data pipeline incident.  Using  to profile your code can help identify performance bottlenecks related to method calls.While  itself doesn’t introduce direct security vulnerabilities, it’s crucial to ensure that the logic within the static method is secure.  If the method processes user-provided input, it must be properly validated to prevent code injection or other attacks.  Avoid deserializing untrusted data within a  without strict validation.We use a combination of unit tests, integration tests, and property-based tests (using Hypothesis) to verify the correctness of  methods.  Unit tests focus on testing the method’s logic in isolation, while integration tests verify its interaction with other components.  Property-based tests generate random inputs to uncover edge cases and potential bugs.Our  file includes the following configuration:We integrate  into our CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.  Every pull request triggers a suite of tests, including type checking with  and code coverage analysis.
  
  
  Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns
  Trying to access instance state within a . Using  when a class method () is more appropriate (e.g., for factory methods).  Failing to type-hint the function signature correctly.  Putting too much complex logic inside a , making it difficult to test and maintain.  Relying on global state or external dependencies within a  without explicitly declaring them.Misunderstanding Semantics: Treating  as a way to hide methods instead of indicating a lack of instance dependency.
  
  
  Best Practices & Architecture
 Always type-hint  methods. Use  for functions that are logically related to the class but don’t require access to instance state. Validate all inputs to  methods. Keep  methods small and focused.  Avoid hardcoding configuration values within  methods; use dependency injection or configuration files. Automate testing, linting, and type checking with CI/CD pipelines. is a powerful tool for building robust, scalable, and maintainable Python systems.  While seemingly simple, its correct usage is crucial for avoiding subtle bugs, improving performance, and enhancing code clarity.  Mastering this feature requires a deep understanding of Python internals, typing, and testing practices.  Refactor legacy code to leverage  where appropriate, measure performance improvements, and enforce strict type checking to reap the full benefits.  It’s a small detail that can make a significant difference in the long run.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Python Fundamentals: @property</title><link>https://dev.to/devopsfundamentals/python-fundamentals-property-iai</link><author>DevOps Fundamental</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 17:29:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
  
  
  The Devil in the Details: Mastering  for Production Python
In late 2022, a seemingly innocuous change to a data validation layer in our high-throughput financial data pipeline triggered a cascade of intermittent errors. The root cause? A poorly designed  used to lazily compute a derived field. Under heavy load, the property’s internal caching mechanism wasn’t thread-safe, leading to inconsistent data being passed to downstream services. This incident highlighted a critical truth:  isn’t just syntactic sugar; it’s a powerful tool with subtle implications for correctness, performance, and scalability in production systems. This post dives deep into , moving beyond basic usage to explore its architectural impact, debugging challenges, and best practices for building robust Python applications.
  
  
  What is  in Python?
 is a decorator in Python that transforms a method into a read-only attribute access.  Defined in PEP 362, it allows you to encapsulate attribute access logic while maintaining a clean, attribute-like interface.  Internally, it leverages Python’s descriptor protocol. When an object’s attribute is accessed, Python first checks for a  method on the attribute. If present (as is the case with ), it’s invoked, allowing for customized access behavior.  This differs from direct attribute access, which bypasses this descriptor lookup.From a typing perspective,  introduces complexities.  Without explicit type annotations, mypy struggles to infer the return type of the property.  Modern type hinting (using  and explicit return types) is crucial for maintaining type safety.  The standard library’s  module provides a convenient way to define properties within data classes, automatically handling descriptor protocol details.FastAPI Request Handling: In a FastAPI application,  can be used to lazily parse and validate request headers or query parameters. This avoids unnecessary parsing if the data isn’t used.  However, caching parsed values within the property is crucial for performance, and must be thread-safe in a multi-worker environment.  We use Celery extensively.  A  on a task object can dynamically determine the task’s priority based on input data, without requiring the priority to be pre-calculated and stored. This allows for dynamic prioritization based on real-time conditions.  Pydantic models often use  to define computed fields. For example, calculating a total price based on quantity and unit price.  Pydantic’s validation and serialization capabilities integrate seamlessly with , ensuring data integrity.  In a complex CLI tool, a  can encapsulate the logic for determining the output format (e.g., JSON, YAML, text) based on command-line arguments.  In a machine learning pipeline, a  can lazily load and preprocess a feature vector from disk, only when it’s actually needed by the model. This reduces memory footprint and improves startup time.
  
  
  Integration with Python Tooling
 interacts significantly with several tools:  Requires explicit type annotations for the property’s return type.  Using  is best practice when overriding inherited properties.  Properties are accessed like regular attributes during testing, simplifying test setup.  Seamlessly integrates with computed fields, providing validation and serialization.  Simplifies property definition within data classes.  Care must be taken when properties access asynchronous resources.  Use asyncio.get_event_loop().run_in_executor() to avoid blocking the event loop.Here's a  snippet demonstrating mypy configuration:This example demonstrates lazy loading and caching.  The  is only fetched from the environment once.  The  property depends on the , ensuring it’s always up-to-date.
  
  
  Failure Scenarios & Debugging
A common failure scenario is race conditions when multiple threads access a property that modifies internal state.  In our financial pipeline incident, the caching mechanism wasn’t thread-safe, leading to data corruption.Another issue is unexpected side effects.  If a property performs complex operations, it can be difficult to reason about its behavior.  Set breakpoints within the property’s getter method to inspect the state.  Log the property’s value and any intermediate calculations.  Analyze the traceback to identify the source of the error.  Profile the property’s execution to identify performance bottlenecks. Add  statements to verify expected conditions.Example traceback (simplified):Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "...", line 100, in process_data
    total = order.total_price  # Accessing the property

  File "...", line 50, in total_price
    self._calculate_total() # Thread-unsafe calculation

  File "...", line 60, in _calculate_total
    # Race condition leads to incorrect total


  
  
  Performance & Scalability
Properties introduce overhead compared to direct attribute access.  Lazy evaluation can improve performance if the property isn’t always needed, but caching is crucial to avoid repeated calculations.  Properties should operate on the object’s internal state.  Minimize memory allocations within the property.  Use locks or thread-safe data structures to protect shared state. For extremely performance-critical properties, consider implementing the underlying logic in a C extension.Properties can introduce security vulnerabilities if they handle untrusted input.  Insecure deserialization or code injection can occur if a property parses data from an external source without proper validation.  Thoroughly validate all input data.  Only access data from trusted sources.  Assume all input is malicious.  Run untrusted code in a sandboxed environment.Testing  requires thorough unit and integration tests.  Property-based testing (using Hypothesis) can help uncover edge cases.  Type validation (using mypy) is essential for ensuring type safety.  Run tests with different Python versions and dependencies.  Automate testing and deployment.  Enforce code style and type checking.
  
  
  Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns
 Using  for simple attribute access adds unnecessary overhead.  Properties should be pure functions; avoid modifying object state.  Leads to type errors and reduced maintainability.  Race conditions in multi-threaded environments.  Properties should be concise and focused.  Move complex logic to separate methods.Mutable Default Arguments:  A classic Python pitfall, exacerbated by lazy evaluation in properties.
  
  
  Best Practices & Architecture
  Always use explicit type annotations.  Keep properties focused on attribute access logic.  Validate all input data.  Break down complex properties into smaller, reusable components.  Use configuration files to manage property values.  Inject dependencies into the object to improve testability.  Automate testing, linting, and deployment.  Ensure consistent builds across environments.  Clearly document the purpose and behavior of each property. is a powerful feature that, when used correctly, can significantly improve the design and maintainability of Python applications. However, it’s crucial to understand its subtle implications for performance, scalability, and security. By following the best practices outlined in this post, you can harness the power of  to build robust, scalable, and reliable Python systems.  Refactor legacy code to add type hints and caching, measure performance with profiling tools, and write comprehensive tests to ensure correctness.  The devil is in the details, and mastering  is a key step towards becoming a proficient Python engineer.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Immobilienmarkt 2025: Was Investoren wirklich wissen müssen</title><link>https://dev.to/smartlandlord/immobilienmarkt-2025-was-investoren-wirklich-wissen-mussen-45co</link><author>Lukas Schneider</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 17:23:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Die Prognosen für den deutschen Immobilienmarkt 2025 könnten unterschiedlicher nicht sein. Während die einen das Ende des Booms ausrufen, sehen andere nur eine gesunde Korrektur vor dem nächsten Aufwärtszyklus. Zwischen Schwarzmalerei und Euphorie liegt die Wahrheit – und sie ist komplexer als die meisten Marktbeobachter wahrhaben wollen.Erfolgreiche Investoren orientieren sich nicht an Schlagzeilen, sondern an fundamentalen Daten und strukturellen Trends. Diese zeigen ein differenziertes Bild: Während manche Märkte überhitzt sind, entstehen anderswo neue Opportunitäten. Der Schlüssel liegt im Verständnis der zugrundeliegenden Kräfte, die den Markt 2025 prägen werden.
  
  
  Zinswende: Das Ende der Nullzins-Ära
Die Europäische Zentralbank hat die Zinswende eingeleitet, und das verändert alles. Nach über einem Jahrzehnt billiger Liquidität müssen sich Immobilieninvestoren an eine neue Realität gewöhnen. Baugeld um 4% statt 1% bedeutet nicht nur höhere Finanzierungskosten – es ändert die gesamte Investitionslogik.Auswirkungen auf Kaufpreise: Höhere Zinsen reduzieren die Kaufkraft der Investoren. Was bei 1% Zinsen noch rentabel war, wird bei 4% zum Verlustgeschäft. Die Folge: Preiskorrekturen, besonders bei überteuerten Objekten.Renditeerwartungen steigen: Investoren verlangen höhere Renditen als Kompensation für gestiegene Finanzierungskosten. Die Zeiten von 2-3% Mietrenditen sind vorbei. Mindestens 4-5% müssen es schon sein.Segmentierung des Marktes: Premium-Lagen bleiben resilient, während B- und C-Lagen unter Druck geraten. Die Spreizung zwischen Top-Objekten und Standard-Immobilien wird größer.Deutschland altert, schrumpft in manchen Regionen und wächst in anderen. Diese demografischen Verschiebungen prägen langfristig die Immobiliennachfrage mehr als kurzfristige Zinszyklen.Urbanisierung setzt sich fort: Der Trend zu den Städten ist ungebrochen, auch wenn Corona temporär für Verunsicherung sorgte. Junge, gut ausgebildete Menschen ziehen weiterhin in Metropolen. Das stützt urbane Immobilienmärkte langfristig.: Immer mehr Ein- und Zwei-Personen-Haushalte bedeuten steigende Nachfrage nach kleineren Wohnungen. Micro-Apartments und 1-2 Zimmer Wohnungen haben Zukunft.: Die Babyboomer-Generation wird zu einer wichtigen Nachfragegruppe. Barrierefreie, zentral gelegene Wohnungen mit Service-Angeboten sind gefragt.
  
  
  Regulierung: Mehr Staat, weniger Markt
Die Politik entdeckt den Immobilienmarkt als Handlungsfeld. Mietpreisbremse, Modernisierungsumlage-Begrenzung und verschärfte Energiestandards sind nur der Anfang. Weitere Regulierung ist zu erwarten.Energetische Standards verschärfen sich: Der Green Deal der EU wird zu strengeren Energieeffizienz-Anforderungen führen. Immobilien ohne entsprechende Standards werden schwerer vermietbar und weniger wert.Mieterschutz wird ausgebaut: Politischer Druck für bezahlbaren Wohnraum führt zu weiteren Beschränkungen für Vermieter. Mieterhöhungen werden schwieriger, Eigenbedarfskündigungen komplizierter.Besteuerung könnte sich ändern: Diskussionen über Immobiliensteuern, Leerstandsabgaben oder Spekulationssteuern nehmen zu. Investoren müssen mit steigender Steuerbelastung rechnen.
  
  
  Regionale Märkte: Die Spreizung wird größer
Deutschland ist kein einheitlicher Immobilienmarkt, sondern besteht aus Dutzenden regionaler Teilmärkte mit unterschiedlichen Dynamiken.A-Städte erreichen Plateau: München, Frankfurt und Hamburg nähern sich Bewertungsobergrenzen. Weitere Preissteigerungen werden schwieriger, Renditen bleiben niedrig.: Dresden, Nürnberg, Münster und andere B-Städte bieten attraktive Chance-Risiko-Profile. Moderate Preise, solide Nachfrage, weniger Regulierung.: Strukturschwache Regionen kämpfen mit Abwanderung und wirtschaftlichen Problemen. Nur sehr selektive Investments machen Sinn.Ländliche Gebiete differenziert: Speckgürtel der Metropolen profitieren weiter, abgelegene Regionen stagnieren oder schrumpfen.
  
  
  Technologie: Disruptor oder Hype?
PropTech verspricht die Digitalisierung der Immobilienbranche. Blockchain, KI und IoT sollen Effizienz steigern und neue Geschäftsmodelle ermöglichen. Die Realität ist ernüchternder.: Tools wie SmartLandlord.de zeigen das Potenzial datengetriebener Immobilienanalyse. Präzisere Bewertungen und bessere Investitionsentscheidungen werden möglich.: Intelligente Gebäudetechnik entwickelt sich vom Nice-to-have zum Must-have. Energie-Management, Sicherheit und Komfort verschmelzen.: Online-Portale für Mieter und Vermieter reduzieren Verwaltungsaufwand und verbessern Service-Qualität.
  
  
  Nachhaltigkeit: Nicht nur Trend, sondern Pflicht
ESG-Kriterien (Environmental, Social, Governance) werden von Regulierung und Markt getrieben. Nachhaltige Immobilien erzielen Premium-Bewertungen, während "braune" Assets abgestraft werden.Energieeffizienz wird kritisch: Ohne angemessene Effizienzklasse wird Vermietung schwierig und teuer. Sanierungskosten können erheblich sein.: Bezahlbarer Wohnraum, Barrierefreiheit und soziale Durchmischung werden wichtiger. Investor Relations berücksichtigen zunehmend Impact-Aspekte.: Transparenz, Compliance und professionelle Verwaltung werden zu Differenzierungsmerkmalen.
  
  
  Finanzierungslandschaft im Wandel
Die Finanzierungslandschaft verändert sich grundlegend. Traditionelle Banken werden zurückhaltender, alternative Finanzierung wächst.Banken verschärfen Kriterien: Higher Eigenkapitalanforderungen, strengere Bonitätsprüfung, konservativere Bewertungen. Finanzierung wird teurer und schwieriger.Alternative Finanzierung wächst: Crowdfunding, Private Debt und Non-Bank-Lender gewinnen Marktanteile. Mehr Optionen, aber auch höhere Kosten.Internationale Kapitalgeber: Ausländische Investoren bringen frisches Kapital, aber auch andere Renditeerwartungen und Strategien.
  
  
  Prognosen für 2025: Szenario-Analyse
Basisszenario (Wahrscheinlichkeit 60%):Moderate Preiskorrekturen von 10-15% bis 2025Zinsen stabilisieren sich bei 3,5-4,5%Mietrenditen steigen auf 4-6% je nach LageVermietungsmarkt bleibt robustStress-Szenario (Wahrscheinlichkeit 25%):Deutliche Preiskorrekturen von 20-30%Finanzierungskrise und ZwangsverkäufeRezession belastet VermietungsmärkteOptimismus-Szenario (Wahrscheinlichkeit 15%):Preise stabilisieren sich schnellZinsen fallen wieder unter 3%Immigration und Wirtschaftswachstum stützen NachfrageTechnologie-Boom in deutschen Städten
  
  
  Investmentstrategien für 2025
: Fokus auf Core-Assets in stabilen Lagen. Moderate Verschuldung, lange Zinsbindungen, diversifizierte Mieterstruktur.: Antizyklisches Investment in korrigierten Märkten. Distressed Assets und Entwicklungschancen nutzen.: Energetische Sanierung und Modernisierung schaffen Mehrwerte. Regulatorische Anforderungen als Chance nutzen.: Digitale Tools für bessere Analyse und Verwaltung. KI-gestützte Entscheidungsfindung wird Wettbewerbsvorteil.
  
  
  Risiken nicht unterschätzen
: Weitere Zinsanstiege können Bewertungen unter Druck setzen.: Verschärfte Mietgesetze oder neue Steuern belasten Renditen.: Rezession würde Vermietungsmärkte und Immobilienwerte belasten.: Schwierigere Finanzierung kann zu Verkaufsdruck führen.
  
  
  Fazit: Selektivität wird entscheidend
2025 wird ein Jahr der Wahrheit für den deutschen Immobilienmarkt. Die strukturellen Trends sind weiterhin positiv, aber die zyklischen Herausforderungen erheblich. Erfolgreiche Investoren werden die sein, die selektiv vorgehen, fundamentale Analyse betreiben und antizyklisch denken.Pauschal-Empfehlungen funktionieren nicht mehr. Jedes Investment muss einzeln geprüft und bewertet werden. Wer die richtigen Tools nutzt und professionell vorgeht, findet auch 2025 attraktive Opportunitäten im deutschen Immobilienmarkt.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Python Fundamentals: @dataclass</title><link>https://dev.to/devopsfundamentals/python-fundamentals-dataclass-59kl</link><author>DevOps Fundamental</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 17:11:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
  
  
  The Pragmatic Dataclass: From Production Incident to Scalable Architecture
A few years ago, we experienced a subtle but critical bug in our real-time bidding (RTB) system. The root cause? A seemingly innocuous change to a data model representing bid requests. We’d moved from a simple  to a  for type safety and validation. What we  anticipate was the performance impact of repeated object creation and destruction within a high-throughput, async processing pipeline. This incident highlighted the power – and potential pitfalls – of  in production. This post dives deep into leveraging  effectively, covering architecture, performance, debugging, and best practices for building robust Python systems.
  
  
  What is "@dataclass" in Python?
, introduced in Python 3.7 (PEP 557, PEP 563), is a decorator that automatically adds methods like , , , and others to classes. It’s fundamentally syntactic sugar, reducing boilerplate code.  Under the hood, it leverages the  module, which is implemented in C for performance.  Crucially,  integrates deeply with Python’s typing system, enabling static analysis with tools like . It doesn’t  traditional classes; it’s a specialized tool for data-holding objects.  The core benefit is improved code clarity and reduced errors, especially in complex data structures.FastAPI Request/Response Models: We extensively use  to define request and response schemas in our FastAPI microservices. This provides automatic validation via Pydantic (which integrates seamlessly with ) and clear documentation via OpenAPI.  In our distributed task queue (built on Celery and asyncio),  defines the structure of tasks. This ensures type consistency across workers and simplifies serialization/deserialization.Type-Safe Data Models for Data Pipelines:  We use  to represent data records flowing through our ETL pipelines. This allows us to enforce schema validation at various stages, preventing data corruption.CLI Tools with Argument Parsing: integration with  (using libraries like ) simplifies the creation of command-line interfaces with type-safe arguments.Machine Learning Preprocessing:  Configuration objects for ML pipelines, defining feature transformations and model parameters, are often best represented as  instances.
  
  
  Integration with Python Tooling
 shines when combined with other tools. Here's a snippet from our :We enforce strict type checking with , catching potential errors early.  Pydantic is used for runtime validation and serialization/deserialization.  We also leverage  with coverage reporting to ensure thorough testing.  For async code, we use  and  extensively, and  objects are passed between coroutines.  We use logging with structured logging (e.g., ) to log  instances as JSON for easy analysis.This example demonstrates a frozen (immutable)  for  and a mutable .  field(default_factory=list) is crucial for mutable default values to avoid shared state.   allows for custom validation logic.  We often use inheritance with  to create specialized data models.
  
  
  Failure Scenarios & Debugging
A common issue is forgetting that  creates shallow copies.  Modifying a nested mutable object within a  instance will affect all instances sharing that object.  We encountered this when a shared list of keywords was inadvertently modified, leading to incorrect bidding decisions.Debugging involves standard techniques:  for stepping through code,  for tracing execution, and  for identifying the source of errors.  For performance issues,  is invaluable.  Here's an example of using  to identify bottlenecks:python  cProfile  profile_output.prof your_script.py
Then, analyze the output with :Runtime assertions are also critical:
  
  
  Performance & Scalability
The initial RTB bug stemmed from excessive object creation.  We were creating new  instances for every bid request, even when the data was largely the same.  We addressed this by implementing object pooling and using  to reduce memory overhead.   prevents the creation of  for each instance, saving memory and improving attribute access speed.Benchmarking with  is essential before and after optimizations.  For async code, use asyncio.run(async_benchmark()) to measure performance accurately. itself doesn't introduce direct security vulnerabilities. However, if you deserialize  instances from untrusted sources (e.g., JSON from a user), you must be extremely careful.  Insecure deserialization can lead to code injection or arbitrary object creation.  Always validate input thoroughly and consider using a safe deserialization library like  or  with strict schema validation.Our testing strategy includes:  Testing individual  methods and validation logic.  Testing the interaction of  instances with other components.Property-Based Tests (Hypothesis):  Generating random  instances to test edge cases.  Ensuring type correctness.Our CI pipeline uses  to run tests with different Python versions and  to enforce code style and type checking.  GitHub Actions automates the entire process.
  
  
  Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns
 Using mutable objects (lists, dicts) as default values. Use field(default_factory=list) instead.  Not using  when immutability is desired.  Assuming copies are deep when they are not. Using  for simple data structures where a  would suffice.  Not implementing  for validation. Missing performance gains by not using  when appropriate.
  
  
  Best Practices & Architecture
  Always use type hints.Immutability Where Possible:  Prefer frozen  instances.  Keep data models separate from business logic.  Validate input and handle potential errors gracefully.  Use  to represent configuration, and layer configurations for different environments.  Use dependency injection to provide  instances to components.

  The Unsung Hero: Deep Dive into  in Production Python
In late 2022, a critical incident brought the subtle power of  into sharp focus at ScaleAI. We were experiencing intermittent failures in our data labeling pipeline, specifically during the dynamic instantiation of custom data validation rules. These rules, defined as classes inheriting from a base validator, were being instantiated based on configuration loaded from a distributed key-value store (etcd). The root cause wasn’t the validation logic itself, but a race condition during class resolution when the configuration changed mid-deployment.  The dynamic nature of our system, coupled with aggressive caching, meant we were sometimes instantiating validators with stale class definitions.  A careful refactoring leveraging  as a factory method resolved the issue, ensuring consistent class resolution and preventing the intermittent failures. This incident highlighted that  isn’t just a syntactic sugar; it’s a crucial tool for building robust, dynamically configurable systems in Python.  It matters in modern Python ecosystems – cloud-native services, data pipelines, web APIs, and machine learning ops – because these systems often require dynamic behavior and factory patterns.
  
  
  What is  in Python?
 is a decorator that transforms a method within a class into a class method. Technically, it binds the method to the class itself, rather than to an instance of the class. This means the first argument passed to the method is the class itself (), not the instance ().  This is defined in PEP 3 (Python Enhancement Proposal 3) and further clarified in the official documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#classmethod).From a CPython internals perspective,  essentially modifies the method descriptor to set its  method to return the function bound to the class object, rather than an instance.  This is crucial for understanding how it differs from instance methods and static methods.  The typing system recognizes  through , allowing for static type checking of the  argument.  Tools like  leverage this to ensure type safety when working with class methods.FastAPI Dependency Injection with Dynamic Configuration:  We use  to create factory methods for database connection pools in FastAPI. The connection parameters (host, port, credentials) are loaded from environment variables or a configuration service.  A class method dynamically configures the pool based on the current environment, ensuring each deployment uses the correct database settings. This avoids hardcoding credentials and simplifies environment-specific configurations.Async Job Queues with Task Factories: In a Celery-based asynchronous task queue, we use  to create task factories.  The class method receives the task configuration (e.g., retry policy, queue name) and returns an instance of the task class, pre-configured with the specified parameters. This allows us to dynamically adjust task behavior without modifying the task code itself.Type-Safe Data Models with Alternate Constructors:  We’ve implemented a system for defining data models using Pydantic.  Sometimes, we need to construct objects from data sources that don’t directly map to the Pydantic model’s fields.   provides a clean way to define alternate constructors that handle these specific data formats, ensuring type safety and validation.CLI Tools with Subcommand Factories:  For a complex CLI tool built with Click, we use  to create factories for subcommand classes.  The class method receives the command-line arguments and returns an instance of the appropriate subcommand class, allowing for dynamic subcommand resolution based on user input.ML Preprocessing Pipelines with Dynamic Feature Engineering: In our machine learning pipelines, we use  to create factory methods for feature engineering steps. The class method receives the feature configuration (e.g., scaling method, transformation parameters) and returns an instance of the feature engineering class, pre-configured with the specified parameters. This allows us to dynamically adjust the feature engineering process without modifying the core pipeline code.
  
  
  Integration with Python Tooling
 integrates seamlessly with modern Python tooling. correctly infers the type of the  argument and performs static type checking.  We enforce strict type checking with the following in our :
  Class methods can be easily tested using .  We often use  to provide class-level fixtures for testing class methods. is frequently used to create custom validators or alternate constructors for Pydantic models, ensuring data integrity. While dataclasses primarily focus on data storage,  can be used to provide custom initialization logic or factory methods for dataclasses.  Class methods can be defined as  to create asynchronous factory methods, which is crucial for building scalable asynchronous applications.This example demonstrates a factory pattern using . The  method dynamically loads validator classes based on the configuration, caching them for performance.  The  annotation ensures that  is a class variable, shared across all instances.
  
  
  Failure Scenarios & Debugging
A common failure scenario is incorrect handling of inheritance when using . If a subclass overrides a class method without calling the superclass’s implementation, it can break the inheritance chain and lead to unexpected behavior.Another issue is race conditions when dynamically loading classes, as experienced in our production incident.  Caching is essential for performance, but stale cache entries can lead to incorrect behavior.Debugging these issues requires careful use of logging and tracing.  We use structured logging with correlation IDs to track requests through the system.   can be used to step through the code and inspect the state of the  argument.   can help identify performance bottlenecks in the class method.  Runtime assertions can be used to verify that the  argument is of the expected type.Example traceback (simplified):Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "...", line 10, in from_config
    return cls.VALIDATOR_CACHE[validator_type](config)
  File "...", line 20, in __init__
    super().__init__(config)
TypeError: __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'config'
This indicates a mismatch between the expected arguments in the superclass's  method and the arguments being passed.
  
  
  Performance & Scalability
 itself doesn’t introduce significant performance overhead. However, the code within the class method can impact performance.  Avoid global state and unnecessary allocations.  If the class method performs I/O operations, consider using asynchronous programming to improve scalability.  Caching, as demonstrated in the example above, is crucial for performance when dynamically loading classes.  We use Redis as a distributed cache to store the loaded validator classes.We benchmarked the  method using  and found that caching reduced the instantiation time by over 90%.Dynamically loading classes based on configuration can introduce security risks.  Ensure that the configuration source is trusted and that the loaded classes are properly validated.  Avoid using  or  to execute arbitrary code.  Implement input validation to prevent code injection attacks.  Consider using a sandbox environment to isolate the loaded classes.We use a combination of unit tests, integration tests, and property-based tests to verify the correctness of class methods.  Unit tests verify the logic within the class method in isolation.  Integration tests verify that the class method interacts correctly with other components of the system.  Property-based tests (using Hypothesis) generate random inputs to test the class method against a wide range of scenarios.Our CI/CD pipeline includes the following steps: runs unit and integration tests. performs static type checking. runs tests in multiple Python environments.GitHub Actions automatically runs the CI/CD pipeline on every pull request.Pre-commit hooks enforce code style and linting.
  
  
  Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns
Forgetting to call :  This breaks the inheritance chain.Using  for instance-specific logic:  This defeats the purpose of the decorator.  Simple instance methods are often more appropriate.  This reduces the benefits of static type checking.Not caching dynamically loaded classes:  This leads to performance bottlenecks.Lack of input validation when dynamically loading classes: This introduces security vulnerabilities.
  
  
  Best Practices & Architecture
 Always use type hints to improve code readability and maintainability.  Keep class methods focused on a single responsibility.  Validate inputs and handle exceptions gracefully.  Break down complex systems into smaller, reusable modules.  Use a layered configuration approach to manage environment-specific settings.  Use dependency injection to improve testability and flexibility.  Automate testing, linting, and deployment.  Use Docker to create reproducible build environments.  Write clear and concise documentation. is a powerful tool for building robust, scalable, and maintainable Python systems.  Mastering this decorator allows you to create flexible factory patterns, dynamically configure your applications, and improve code readability.  Refactor legacy code to leverage  where appropriate, measure performance, write comprehensive tests, and enforce linting and type checking.  By adopting these best practices, you can unlock the full potential of  and build more resilient and adaptable Python applications.  Start by identifying areas in your codebase where dynamic class instantiation or configuration is used and consider refactoring them to utilize  for improved clarity and robustness.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Python Fundamentals: :=</title><link>https://dev.to/devopsfundamentals/python-fundamentals--2fla</link><author>DevOps Fundamental</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 16:48:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
  
  
  The Walrus Operator (:=) in Production Python: A Deep Dive
Last quarter, a critical performance regression surfaced in our real-time fraud detection pipeline. The root cause? An inefficient loop within a data preprocessing stage, repeatedly querying a Redis cache.  The initial fix involved a complex refactoring to avoid redundant lookups.  However, a subsequent code review revealed a cleaner, more Pythonic solution leveraging the walrus operator () introduced in Python 3.8.  This wasn’t just about aesthetics; it demonstrably improved performance by 15% and reduced code complexity. This incident highlighted that , often dismissed as syntactic sugar, is a powerful tool for optimizing data-intensive applications, particularly in cloud-native microservices where performance and resource utilization are paramount.  This post details how to effectively and safely integrate  into production Python systems.The walrus operator, formally known as the assignment expression, was introduced by PEP 572.  It allows you to assign a value to a variable .  Unlike a standard assignment statement, which is a statement,  returns the assigned value.  From a CPython internals perspective,  introduces a new opcode () into the bytecode.  This opcode effectively combines assignment and value retrieval.  The typing system treats the assigned variable as having its type inferred from the right-hand side of the expression.  Standard library usage is limited, but the  module fully supports it, and tools like  and  seamlessly integrate with assignment expressions.FastAPI Request Handling:  In a high-throughput API, parsing request bodies can be expensive.  Using  allows us to parse the body once and reuse the result:
This avoids redundant parsing, improving latency under load.Async Job Queues (Celery/RQ):  When processing tasks, we often need to fetch metadata about the task itself.
This reduces Redis round trips.Type-Safe Data Models (Pydantic):  Validating and transforming data is crucial.
 allows for concise error handling during model instantiation.  Parsing command-line arguments can be streamlined.

  
  
  Integration with Python Tooling

  No special configuration is needed for .  Standard testing practices apply.  As shown above,  models integrate seamlessly.  The  module provides full support for type hints with assignment expressions. can be used within logging statements, but be mindful of potential performance impacts if the assignment is complex.This pattern provides a concise way to load configuration with a default fallback.  It's more readable than nested  statements.
  
  
  Failure Scenarios & Debugging
A common mistake is using  in contexts where it's not allowed (e.g., inside a  block's  clause). This leads to a .  Another issue arises in asynchronous code:If  fails  the assignment but  the  check,  might not be initialized, leading to an .  Use  blocks to handle potential exceptions during the assignment.  Debugging can be done with  or logging:
  
  
  Performance & Scalability
 can improve performance by reducing redundant computations or I/O operations. However, excessive use can introduce overhead.  Use  and  to benchmark performance.  Avoid using  within tight loops if the assigned value isn't immediately used.If the assigned value comes from untrusted input (e.g., user-provided data), validate it thoroughly to prevent code injection or other security vulnerabilities.  The walrus operator itself doesn't introduce new security risks, but it can make existing vulnerabilities more subtle.  Test all code paths, including cases where the assignment fails.  Verify that  works correctly in the context of your application. is essential for catching type errors.  Include  and  in your CI pipeline.

  
  
  Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns
  Using  where a standard assignment is clearer.  Trying to cram too much logic into a single assignment expression.  Failing to handle exceptions during the assignment.  Using  in a way that creates unexpected variable scope problems.  Creating expressions that are difficult to understand.
  
  
  Best Practices & Architecture
  Always use type hints with .  Keep assignment expressions concise and focused.  Handle potential exceptions gracefully.  Break down complex logic into smaller, reusable functions.  Use a layered configuration approach.  Use dependency injection to improve testability.The walrus operator is a valuable addition to the Python toolkit.  When used judiciously, it can improve code readability, performance, and maintainability.  Mastering  requires understanding its nuances and potential pitfalls.  Refactor legacy code to leverage this feature where appropriate, measure the performance impact, and enforce type checking to ensure code quality.  It’s not a silver bullet, but a powerful tool for building robust and scalable Python systems.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Let’s Build a Game!

The root cause wasn’t a database bottleneck or a network issue, but a subtle interaction between a custom logging decorator and a function accepting a variable number of arguments via . The decorator, intended to time function execution, was incorrectly unpacking the  tuple, leading to unexpected keyword arguments being passed to downstream functions, ultimately causing a  in a core machine learning model preprocessing step. This incident highlighted a critical truth: while seemingly simple,  is a powerful feature that demands careful consideration in production systems, especially when combined with decorators, asynchronous programming, and complex type systems. This post dives deep into , focusing on architectural implications, performance, debugging, and best practices for building robust Python applications. is a syntactic construct in Python that allows a function to accept an arbitrary number of positional arguments. Technically, it packs these arguments into a tuple named  within the function’s scope.  PEP 3102 (Variable Function Definitions) formally introduced this feature, alongside  for keyword arguments. From a CPython internals perspective,  doesn't create a new data structure at runtime. Instead, the compiler transforms the function definition into code that handles the variable argument list directly.  The  function in CPython is heavily involved in unpacking these arguments.  The typing system, particularly with  and , can be used to provide some static type checking, but it’s often limited without careful annotation.  Tools like  and  can help enforce structure when  is used to pass data that should conform to a specific schema.FastAPI Request Handling:  We use  extensively in custom FastAPI dependency injection logic.  Instead of explicitly defining every possible dependency, we allow dependencies to be passed as positional arguments to a factory function. This provides flexibility when dealing with optional or dynamically configured dependencies.
Async Job Queues (Celery/RQ):  When submitting tasks to an asynchronous queue, we often need to pass a variable number of arguments.  simplifies this process, allowing us to forward arguments directly to the task function.
Type-Safe Data Models (Pydantic):  We’ve built a system for dynamically creating Pydantic models based on configuration files.  is used to pass field definitions to a model factory function, ensuring type safety through Pydantic’s validation.
  Command-line interface libraries often leverage  to handle a variable number of arguments passed to a command.  In our feature engineering pipelines, we frequently use  to pass a dynamic set of transformations to a preprocessing function. This allows us to easily add or remove transformations without modifying the core function signature.
  
  
  Integration with Python Tooling
 interacts significantly with Python tooling.  struggles with untyped  without explicit  annotations.  We enforce strict type checking with a  configuration: fixtures can also benefit from . We use a fixture factory pattern to create fixtures with variable arguments: models can be created dynamically using  as shown earlier, but require careful consideration of type annotations to maintain validation.   can be tricky; if you log the  tuple directly, it can expose sensitive information.  We prefer to log individual arguments with appropriate masking.This example showcases a common pattern: a required positional argument followed by  and optional keyword arguments.  This provides flexibility while maintaining a clear function interface.  We also favor using named arguments whenever possible, even when  is present, to improve readability.
  
  
  Failure Scenarios & Debugging
The incident at ScaleAI was a prime example of what can go wrong. Incorrectly unpacking  in a decorator led to unexpected keyword arguments.  Other failure scenarios include: Passing arguments of the wrong type to functions expecting specific types. Accessing elements in the  tuple beyond its bounds.  If  contains mutable objects and the function is asynchronous, concurrent access can lead to data corruption.Debugging these issues requires careful use of tools.  is invaluable for stepping through code and inspecting the contents of .   can help track the flow of arguments.   provides information about the call stack.   can identify performance bottlenecks related to argument unpacking.  Runtime assertions can validate the expected structure and types of arguments.TypeError: process_data() got an unexpected keyword argument 'extra_arg'

    print(f"Processing data: {args}")

  
  
  Performance & Scalability
Argument unpacking has a performance cost, especially with a large number of arguments.   and  can be used to benchmark performance.  Avoid unnecessary argument unpacking.  If the number of arguments is known in advance, define them explicitly in the function signature.  Consider using C extensions for performance-critical sections of code.  Reducing allocations within the function can also improve performance. can introduce security vulnerabilities if not handled carefully.  If  contains data from untrusted sources, it can be exploited for code injection or privilege escalation.  Always validate input data and sanitize it before processing.  Avoid using  or  on data from .  Use trusted sources for arguments whenever possible.Thorough testing is crucial.  Unit tests should cover various scenarios with different numbers and types of arguments.  Integration tests should verify the interaction between functions that use .  Property-based testing (e.g., using Hypothesis) can generate a wide range of test cases.  Type validation with  and  can catch type errors early.  Our CI pipeline includes: with comprehensive test coverage. for static type checking. to run tests in different Python environments.GitHub Actions to automate the CI process.Pre-commit hooks to enforce code style and type checking.
  
  
  Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns

  Peering into the GRPO equation
We will dissect is this scary-looking (at least to me!) equation: This is the theoretical expectation, which theoretically considers every possible prompt, generates a group of responses for each, and then average the improvement we get from the  (see below) over all these possibilities.This is the sample-based  (the "estimator"). Since we cannot possibly compute the true expectation over all prompts and outputs, we approximate it during training where we take one batch ( a prompt  and its  generated outputs 

 and we compute the numerical estimate of our objective using the objective function. We then use this numerical estimate to calculate a gradient and update our model's weights, i.e. (

 becomes 

).I will break down the equations into the following parts:Part 1: 
Part 2: 
Part 3: 
Part 4: 
Part 5: 
The equation that will be dissected in this part is:The tilde (~): It means "distributed according to" or "is sampled from". So:
 This represents questions (q) sampled from the overall distribution of questions (P(Q)). This is a standard practice where models learn to respond to various prompts during training.
: This means the group of G outputs 

 is sampled from the policy 

 given question q.The expectation function i.e. 
 signifies a joint expectation over multiple random variables. One commonly seen example is 
 which means taking the expectation over the combined process of first sampling X from P(X), and then sampling Y from P(Y|X). The expectation then applies to the function of both X and Y.In probability theory, 
 can be written as 
 for discrete variables, or 
 for continuous variables. The comma notation is a shorthand for this sequential or joint sampling process.Applying to our equation:q ~ P(Q): First, a question  is randomly chosen from the pool of all possible questions.
: Given that specific question , a group of  outputs 

 is then generated by the old policy 

.The expression 

 that follows (the GRPO objective function) then depends on both  and the generated output 

.So, the expectation is taken over the entire data collection process: first randomly pick a question from the bank of available questions, and then generating multiple responses for that question using the 

 policy.The tilde (~) tells you how the data is being generated (which distribution).The comma (,) separates independent (or conditionally independent) sampling steps that define the full set of random variables over which the expectation is taken. It implies a joint probability distribution, often constructed sequentially.
  
  
  Why 

 instead of simply 

?
The notation 

 explicitly states that q is the random variable being sampled, and P(Q) is its probability distribution.Similarly, 

 states that 

 are the random variables (the sampled outputs), and 

 is the conditional probability distribution from which they are drawn (conditioned on q).Without q ~ and 

, the expression 

 is ambiguous as it is not clear which variables are being sampled or how are they related to the function 

. The P(Q) and 

 are distributions, not actual values that vary and contribute to the average.To implement the Expectation operator E[...]. we can use a loop where each iteration processes a new, randomly sampled mini-batch of prompts, calculate the loss for that batch, and performs an update. Over many iterations, this process approximates the expected value of the objective over the entire data distribution.Do not fret that the code is long. I will break it down and explain each piece accordingly.
  
  
  The rollout phase: 
For each prompt q in our batch, we need to generate a group G possible outputs (

) using the fixed, old policy 

. This is the data collection or "rollout" phase.The code is implemented with a nested for loop within  that calls . In the code,  is 

. The outer loop iterates through prompts in the batch, and the inner loop runs  (G) times to generate each output 

 for that prompt.
  
  
  Part 2: 
The concept behind this equation is importance sampling: This represents the probability of generating a specific output

, but using the 
. This is the policy we are actively training and updating in this step. The ratio 

 is the  or .  If 

, the new policy 

 is  to generate output 

 than the old one was.  If 

, the new policy 

 is  to generate output 

.  If 

, the policy has not changed with respect to this specific output.
  
  
  What is its purpose? (Off-Policy Learning)
The primary purpose of this ratio is to enable .In reinforcement learning, the ideal way to evaluate a policy is to use it to generate actions and see what rewards you get. However, generating new outputs (

) from the model for every single gradient update is computationally very expensive.Off-policy methods solve this. We can: Generate a large batch of experiences (the outputs 

) using the 

 policy. Then, perform several steps of optimization on our 

 policy using that same batch of data.The importance sampling ratio is the mathematical "correction factor" that allows us to estimate how good an action is under the  policy (

) using data that was collected by the  policy (

).For the ease of discussion, I will equate:The objective function multiplies this ratio by the advantage 

 (how good the output 

 was). So, the update logic is:  If 

 was a good output (

), we want to increase its probability. Maximising 

 will push 

 to be greater than 1, which in turn pushes 

 to increase.  If 

 was a bad output (

), we want to decrease its probability. Maximising 

 (a negative number) will push 

 to be less than 1, making the overall term less negative and thus decreasing 

.
  
  
  Why is it designed that way? (Stability and PPO)
While the ratio allows for efficient learning, it is also a source of instability. If the new policy 

 becomes very different from the old one 

, the ratio 

 can become extremely large or close to zero. A very large ratio would lead to a massive, noisy gradient update, potentially destroying all the learning the model has already done.This is the problem that Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), from which GRPO's objective is derived, was designed to solve. The design in Equation 1 is a direct implementation of the  (source: Proximal Policy Optimization).The goal is to keep the new policy "proximal" (i.e., close) to the old policy. This creates a "trust region" where we can be confident the update is beneficial.
  
  
  Part 3: 
This is the core of the PPO algorithm, which encourages making the new policy 

 more likely to produce high-advantage outputs, but "clips" the update to prevent it from changing to drastically and destabilsing training.Take for instance we set 

 to be 0.2. We then get the following clipping equation:Examples of how the clipping equation works is below:
 because the value is within the range.
 because the value is beyond the range and is clipped down to the maximum value of 1.2.We can see that with clipping, when the optimiser gets "greedy" and suggests a huge change, the model is still encouraged to make the output more likely, but is prevented from making a dangerously large jump in the policy.This logic is encapsulated within the .The probability ratio 

 is calculated in log-space for 
numerical stability: 

).The helper function  is responsible for computing log P(o_i | q) for a given policy.
  
  
  Part 4: 
The purpose of this  function is to act as a floor, i.e.: When an output is good (positive 

), it prevents the update from becoming too rewarding. When an output is bad (negative 

), it acts as a floor on the penalty.In both cases, the  function prevents the model from making a large policy change too quickly.Using back the same clipping function in Part 3, where we set 

, 

, and we now assume we have an advantage value 

. The equation we thus get is:
  
  
  Part 5: 
This function acts as a regulariser, penalising the policy 

 for deviating from a reference policy 

. (Note: When we say policy, we are actually referring to the LLM as weights, so 

 refers to the LLM with updated weights, while 

 usually refers to the original stock LLM.)_The paper defines the term as:What is key is to recognise that this equation is not the standard Kulback-Leibler (KL) divergence, but a more specific, per-sample approximation chosen for being computationally cheaper. This compares to the standard KL divergence which can be expressed as:Compared to the standard definition, there are two main differences: The standard definition is an  over the entire distribution 

, whereas the paper's variant is an expression for a 
. The functional form of the paper's variant is different from the term inside the standard expectation.
  
  
  Deconstruction and Analysis of the variant of KL divergence
For simplicity, let the probability ratio be :Then Equation (2) defines a function 

:This function is evaluated for a single sample 

, which itself was drawn from the  policy, 

.In order for 

 to be a valid divergence measure, it must satisfy two properties:
.Identity of Indiscernibles:
 if and only if 

. Proof that 

 satisfies the two properties is in Appendix A. This term is a regularizer. It penalizes the objective if the trainable policy π_θ strays too far from the original, trusted reference policy π_ref, helping to prevent catastrophic forgetting.Code Implementation: Also within .The Advantage Function 

 is a central component in modern policy gradient methods. Intuitively, the advantage tells us not just if an action was "good" (positive reward), but if it was "better than average". It is designed to reduce sensitivity to reward scaling, and stabilises training by preventing outlier rewards. A more technical discussion about the advantage function is available in Appendix B.Given that the advantage 

 tells us how much better or worse a specific output 

 was compared. to the average of its group, this requires two steps:Calculate the raw reward 

; andIn short, the mathematical equation is:We can implement the code as such:Reward calculation 

 as a simple rule-based reward.
Normalisating to get Advantage 
Finally, we combine all the pieces, average over the batch, and negate the result to create a loss that can be minimised by the optimiser.where N is the total batch size (batch_size * group_size).Code Implementation: The final lines of  and the optimizer.update call in the training loop. The code was displayed in Part 3 above, with the relevant abridged segments reproduced below for ease of reference.
  
  
  Concrete example of how to train using GRPO
Prompt (q): "What is the capital of Malaysia?"Policy (

): The existing LLM we are trying to improveOld policy (

) A frozen copy of the LLM before this training step.Reference policy (

): The original, pre-trained base LLM (e.g. DeepSeek-V3-Base).Hyperparameters:

Clipping epsilon (

): 0.2KL penality beta (

): 0.05
  
  
  Step 1: sample generation and reward calculation
We use the old policy 

 to generate G = 4 different outputs for prompt q. Then ,we use a rule-based reward model to score them."The capital of Malaysia is .""The capital of Malaysia is .""Malaysia's capital city is ."Correct answer, different wording."The capital of Malaysia is Selangor**"Incorrect but Kuala Lumpur is surrounded by Selangor.
  
  
  Step 2: calculate normalised advantage
First, calculate the mean and standard deviation of the rewards:Now, we compute the advantage 

 for each sample:
 (Positive Advantage: this output was better than average)
 (Negative Advantage: this output was worse than average)
 (Positive Advantage)
 (Positive Advantage, but smaller)
  
  
  Step 3: Calculate Policy Probabilities and Ratios
For each of our 4 samples, we need to compute its probability under the old policy (

), the current policy (

), the reference policy (

), and the ratio 

. These are hypothetical values for our example. It is important to note these are not probabilities that sum to 1, as they only represent 4 outputs out of a near-infinite number of possibilities.ratio of current policy to old policy For sample 1, our new policy  is more confident (0.30) than the old one (0.25), so the ratio is > 1. For sample 2, the new policy is less confident, so the ratio is < 1.
  
  
  Step 4: Calculate the Clipped Surrogate Objective for Each Sample
Now we apply the  formula for each sample. The clip range is [1 - ε, 1 + ε] = [0.8, 1.2].Sample 1 (A₁ ≈ 0.567 > 0):  Unclipped term: r₁(θ) * A₁ = 1.20 * 0.567 ≈ 0.680  Clipped ratio: clip(1.20, 0.8, 1.2) = 1.2  Clipped term: min(0.680, 0.680) = 0.680. The ratio was within the clip bounds.Sample 2 (A₂ ≈ -1.495 < 0):  Unclipped term: r₂(θ) * A₂ = 0.70 * -1.495 ≈ -1.047  Clipped ratio: clip(0.70, 0.8, 1.2) = 0.8  Clipped term: min(-1.047, -1.196) = -1.196. The value is clipped.
This is a subtle but crucial point. The optimizer's goal is to maximize the objective. An objective of -1.047 is better than -1.196. By forcing the optimizer to take the , we are selecting the worse of the two possible objectives. This limits the size of the policy update, preventing the model from making a large, potentially unstable change even when correcting a mistake.Sample 3 (A₃ ≈ 0.567 > 0):  Unclipped term: r₃(θ) * A₃ = 1.40 * 0.567 ≈ 0.794  Clipped ratio: clip(1.40, 0.8, 1.2) = 1.2  Clipped term: min(0.794, 0.680) = 0.680. The policy update is clipped to prevent it from getting too greedy on this good sample.Sample 4 (A₄ ≈ 0.361 > 0):  Unclipped term: r₄(θ) * A₄ = 0.84 * 0.361 ≈ 0.303  Clipped ratio: clip(0.84, 0.8, 1.2) = 0.84  Clipped term: min(0.303, 0.303) = 0.303. The ratio was within the clip bounds.
  
  
  Step 5: Calculate the KL Penalty for Each Sample (Using Equation 2)
Now we calculate the penalty term D_{KL}(\pi_\theta || \pi_{\text{ref}}) for each sample. Let .
The formula is r_{ref} - log(r_{ref}) - 1.r_{ref} = 0.28 / 0.30 ≈ 0.933. Penalty = 0.933 - log(0.933) - 1 ≈ 0.933 - (-0.069) - 1 = 0.002r_{ref} = 0.15 / 0.21 ≈ 0.714. Penalty = 0.714 - log(0.714) - 1 ≈ 0.714 - (-0.337) - 1 = 0.051r_{ref} = 0.26 / 0.28 ≈ 0.929. Penalty = 0.929 - log(0.929) - 1 ≈ 0.929 - (-0.074) - 1 = 0.003r_{ref} = 0.22 / 0.21 ≈ 1.048. Penalty = 1.048 - log(1.048) - 1 ≈ 1.048 - (0.047) - 1 = 0.001
  
  
  Step 6: Combine Everything to Get the Final Value
The final loss for our batch is the average over the 4 samples. For each sample , the value is (Clipped_Objective_i - β * KL_Penalty_i).0.680 - (0.05 * 0.002) = 0.680 - 0.0001 = 0.6799-1.196 - (0.05 * 0.051) = -1.196 - 0.00255 = -1.198550.680 - (0.05 * 0.003) = 0.680 - 0.00015 = 0.679850.303 - (0.05 * 0.001) = 0.303 - 0.00005 = 0.30295Total Objective  (for this one prompt):J_GRPO = (1/4) * (0.6799 - 1.19855 + 0.67985 + 0.30295) = (1/4) * 0.46415 ≈ 0.116The value  is the number we want to . The optimizer (like Adam) will compute the gradient of this objective with respect to the LLM's parameters () and take a small step in that gradient's direction. This single step will slightly adjust the millions of weights in  to: Increase the probability of outputs like  and  (the good ones). Decrease the probability of the bad output . Do this while being constrained by the clipping mechanism and pulled slightly back towards the original  model to avoid forgetting how to form coherent sentences.Congratulations on making this far.

  Appendix B - A more technical discussion on the advantage function
The , 

, is a central component in modern policy gradient methods. In reinforcement learning, the simplest policy gradient update rule uses the total reward 

 to scale the gradient 

. However, this approach suffers from high variance, meaning the gradient estimates can fluctuate wildly from one batch of samples to another, leading to unstable training.The core idea to reduce this variance is to subtract a 
 from the reward. The baseline should ideally be an estimate of the average reward from state 

. This leads to the Advantage Function:Intuitively, the advantage tells us not just if an action was "good" (positive reward), but if it was "better than average". If 

, the action 

 was better than expected, and its probability should be increased. If 

, the action was worse than expected, and its probability should be decreased.Key Theorem (Baseline Invariance of Policy Gradient):
The introduction of a baseline 

 that depends only on the state  (or in our case, the prompt 

) does not introduce bias into the gradient estimate.
We need to show that 

.This proves that subtracting a baseline does not change the expected gradient, 

. While the expectation is the same, the variance of the gradient estimator 

 is significantly reduced.The paper's specific implementation of the advantage function for a group of 

 outputs 

 is:where 

 are the rewards for the corresponding outputs.
  
  
  Step-by-Step Component Breakdown
Let's deconstruct the formula for the advantage of the -th sample, 

.
  
  
  1. The Rewards: 
: This is the numerical reward assigned to the -th output 

, which was generated for a given prompt 

. The paper specifies (in Section 2.2.2) that these are rule-based rewards.

 A binary or continuous score evaluating if the final answer in 

 is correct. For a math problem, this could be checking if the result matches the known solution. For a coding problem, it could be the percentage of test cases passed. A score evaluating if the output 

 adheres to a desired format (e.g., using  and  tags). The existence of a reward function 

 is a fundamental axiom of the reinforcement learning framework. 

.
  
  
  2. The Baseline: 
 This is the  (or sample average) of the rewards obtained from the  outputs generated for the same prompt . This term serves as the baseline . It's an estimate of the expected reward for the given prompt  under the current (old) policy 

. Instead of using a separate, learned "critic" network to predict the expected reward, the GRPO algorithm uses this simple and efficient empirical estimate from the group of samples. The numerator 

 is the raw, unnormalized advantage. It measures whether the -th output was better or worse than the average performance within its group.
  
  
  3. The Normalization Factor: 
 This is the empirical standard deviation of the rewards from the group.(Note: Sometimes the denominator is  for the biased estimator, but  for the unbiased estimator. In practice, for large , the difference is negligible. We will assume the standard definition.)Purpose of Normalization: Dividing the raw advantage by the standard deviation is a form of data standardization. It rescales the advantages for a given prompt so that their distribution has a standard deviation of 1.Mathematical Justification:
Let the set of raw advantages for a group be 

 .

  The mean of this set is 

 . The advantages are centered at zero.  The standard deviation of this set is 

 .
By dividing each element of 

  by 

 , the resulting set of normalized advantages 

  will have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
  
  
  Why is this Normalization Important?
Reduces Sensitivity to Reward Scaling: Imagine two different tasks. In Task 1, rewards are either 0 or 1. The advantages will be small fractions. In Task 2, rewards are 0 or 1000. The advantages will be large numbers. Without normalization, the gradient updates for Task 2 would be 1000 times larger than for Task 1, potentially destabilizing learning when training on a mix of tasks. Normalization ensures that the scale of the advantage signal is consistent across different prompts and reward schemes. It prevents outlier rewards (a single very high or very low reward in a group) from generating excessively large gradients that could harm the policy. By scaling everything relative to the variation within the group, the updates become more measured and stable.Equation (3) defines a specific form of the advantage function, known as  in its simplest form, with an additional normalization step. It first calculates a raw advantage for each sample 

  by subtracting a baseline from its reward 

 .Uses an Empirical Baseline: The baseline is not a learned value but is efficiently estimated as the mean reward of all samples 

 generated for the same prompt 

 . This conforms to the requirement that the baseline depends only on the prompt 

  (and the policy that generated the samples), thus not introducing bias into the policy gradient.Normalizes the Advantage: The raw advantage is then divided by the standard deviation of the rewards within the group. This standardizes the advantages, making them have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 for that group. This process results in a well-behaved, normalized advantage signal 

 that robustly indicates whether an output was better or worse than average, independent of the absolute scale of the rewards for that particular task. This standardized signal is then used in Equation (1) to provide stable and effective gradient updates for the policy

  The Unsung Hero: Mastering  in Production Python
In late 2022, a critical data pipeline at my previous company, a financial technology firm, experienced intermittent failures during peak trading hours. The root cause wasn’t a database outage or network hiccup, but a subtle interaction between a third-party risk scoring service and our internal data transformation layer. The risk service’s API had undergone a minor version bump, adding optional parameters. Our transformation layer, designed with extensive use of  for flexibility,  to handle the new parameters gracefully. However, under heavy load, the dynamic unpacking and attribute access within the transformation functions led to significant performance degradation and, eventually, timeouts. This incident highlighted a crucial truth:  is a powerful tool, but its unchecked use can introduce subtle performance and reliability issues in production systems. This post dives deep into , exploring its intricacies, best practices, and potential pitfalls for experienced Python engineers building large-scale applications.
  
  
  What is  in Python?
 (short for "keyword arguments") is a Python feature allowing functions to accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Technically, it unpacks a dictionary into keyword arguments.  Defined in PEP 3102, it leverages Python’s function call mechanism to dynamically bind keys in the dictionary to function parameters. From a CPython internals perspective,  translates to creating a frame object with a local variable representing the dictionary. The function then iterates through this dictionary, attempting to match keys to parameter names. This dynamic lookup is where performance concerns arise.  The typing system, via  or , acknowledges its existence but offers limited static checking without explicit type annotations. Tools like Pydantic and type hints are crucial for mitigating this.FastAPI Request Handling: FastAPI leverages  extensively in route handlers.  While providing flexibility, it necessitates careful validation using Pydantic models to ensure type safety and prevent unexpected behavior.  Without validation, a malicious actor could potentially inject arbitrary parameters.Async Job Queues (Celery/RQ):  Asynchronous task queues often use  to pass context and configuration to worker functions. This allows for dynamic task execution without modifying the core task definition.  However, serializing and deserializing these dictionaries for inter-process communication can become a bottleneck.Type-Safe Data Models (Pydantic): Pydantic’s  method allows for flexible data serialization.  However, passing untrusted  directly can bypass validation, leading to data integrity issues.  Command-line interface libraries use  to handle optional arguments.  This simplifies argument parsing but requires robust error handling to manage invalid or unexpected options.Machine Learning Preprocessing (Scikit-learn Pipelines):  Many Scikit-learn transformers accept  to configure their behavior.  This allows for customization but can make pipelines harder to debug if the configuration is not explicitly documented.
  
  
  Integration with Python Tooling
 integration with tooling is critical for maintaining code quality.  Without explicit type hints, mypy treats  as , effectively disabling static type checking.  Using  is a starting point, but ideally, you should define a more specific type using  or a Pydantic model.  Parameterizing tests with  is common, but requires careful consideration of test coverage.  Ensure you test all possible combinations of keyword arguments. Pydantic models can be used to validate  before passing them to functions. This provides a strong type safety net. can define interfaces for functions accepting , enabling static analysis of expected arguments.  Logging functions often accept  for custom formatting.  Be mindful of sensitive data being logged through these dynamic arguments. example (mypy config):This example demonstrates using a  for common configuration options and  for less frequent ones. This approach balances flexibility with type safety.
  
  
  Failure Scenarios & Debugging
A common failure scenario is passing unexpected keyword arguments to a function. This can lead to  exceptions or, worse, silent failures if the function ignores the extra arguments.TypeError: process_data() got an unexpected keyword argument 'invalid_param'
Debugging -related issues can be challenging.   is useful for inspecting the contents of the  dictionary at runtime.   can track the values of keyword arguments as they are passed to functions.   can identify performance bottlenecks caused by dynamic attribute access. Runtime assertions can validate the presence and type of expected arguments.
  
  
  Performance & Scalability
The dynamic nature of  introduces performance overhead.  Attribute access on dictionaries is slower than direct attribute access on objects.  In performance-critical sections of code, avoid excessive use of .  Consider using explicit parameters or data classes instead.This demonstrates that  is significantly faster than . can introduce security vulnerabilities if used improperly.  Specifically, deserializing untrusted data into  can lead to code injection or privilege escalation.  Always validate and sanitize input before passing it to functions via .  Avoid using  or  with data from .Testing -based functions requires comprehensive test coverage.  Use property-based testing (e.g., Hypothesis) to generate a wide range of input values.  Use type validation tools (e.g., Pydantic) to ensure that the arguments passed to functions are of the correct type.
  
  
  Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns
 Passing untrusted data directly into . Using  when explicit parameters would be clearer. Failing to use type hints with .kwargskwargs to functions that also accept kwargs`, creating a complex and hard-to-debug call stack.Mutable Default Arguments: Using mutable default arguments in conjunction with . Failing to document the expected keyword arguments.
  
  
  Best Practices & Architecture
 Always use type hints with , preferably with  or Pydantic models.  Separate common configuration options from less frequent ones. Validate and sanitize input before passing it to functions via .  Design functions with a clear and well-defined interface. Use configuration layering to manage different environments and settings.  Use dependency injection to provide configuration options to functions. Automate testing, linting, and type checking. is a powerful feature that can enhance the flexibility and extensibility of Python code. However, its unchecked use can introduce performance, reliability, and security issues. By understanding its intricacies, adopting best practices, and leveraging appropriate tooling, you can harness the power of  to build robust, scalable, and maintainable Python systems.  Refactor legacy code to embrace type safety, measure performance in critical paths, write comprehensive tests, and enforce linting/type gates to ensure long-term code quality.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Top Scripting Language Resources: Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Bash, &amp; PowerShell</title><link>https://dev.to/vaib/top-scripting-language-resources-python-javascript-ruby-bash-powershell-45hj</link><author>Coder</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 16:01:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Scripting languages are the unsung heroes of modern software development and system administration.

// Verify response structure
pm.expect(jsonData).to.have.property('id');
pm.expect(jsonData.name).to.eql(pm.environment.get("product_name"));
pm.expect(jsonData.price).to.be.above(0);

// Save ID for subsequent tests
pm.environment.set("product_id", jsonData.id);
pm.test("Verify response time", function () {
    pm.expect(pm.response.responseTime).to.be.below(2000);
Environment Configuration

This products/wireless-headphone/ or this ? For me products/wireless-headphone/ url is easy to note.A slug is a URL-friendly version of a string, typically derived from a title, description or name. It only contains lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. This term ‘slug’ comes from newspaper publishing, where it referred to a short name used to identify a story.Example: "Django Slugs: Complete Guide" → django-slugs-complete-guide/api/products/wireless-bluetooth-headphones/ is much better than Search engines love descriptive URLsURLs are readable and shareableUsers can guess what the URL might be and can modify URLs to find similar productsMore professional-looking APIDoesn't expose your database ID sequenceHarder for people to guess other product IDs
  
  
  📌 Basic Slug Implementation
Django makes working with slugs incredibly straightforward with the built-in :Manual entry in Slug field can get tedious, we can automate this by using Django’s  function:When we create a new product with name ‘Python Best Practice Book’, the slug automatically becomes python-best-practice-book.
  
  
  📌 Handling Duplicate Slugs
What happens when two post have the same title? We need to handle duplicates gracefully:This creates slugs like , ,  to handle duplicate names.To make our project or application more professional and top notch, one should definitely utilise Django’s slug functionality wherever we can.Let me know, in the comments about your project where you discovered slug for the first time and how it improved you application?

If you are starting about to learn a programming language or a particular domain, first check have you satisfied these things before proceeding further.
There are tons of resources present on the world wide web. Courses are offered by institutions, academies, professional and individual creators. All these are present either as paid or non-paid services. Websites such as geeks for geeks, medium and many other also contains enriched information regarding the field of study. But there are some things to be carefully evaluated.#"Hello to the world of building things through coding"
a = input("CSE GRAD: ")
#input should be yes or no
if a == "yes":
    print("Choose your areas of interest about a domain")
    print("Select your programming language wisely")
elif a == "no":
    print("Say what field are you in the comments section")
else:
    print("Sit back relax, surf and find your area of interest")
Choose a programming language which you want to learn →This is the point were most of the people including myself does a mistake. Choosing a language by only relying on people's words and direction. Evaluating by means of current trend is not a bad option in my opinion but you have to look wrt what domain you are going to pursue as your career path. First learn about programming languages its features, purpose, ecosystem, community, libraries, use cases and field of work.
At the beginning learn only one language properly, don't switch between 2 or 3 for varied reasons because that makes your path more complicated. You can learn any language as your initial language according to your career path making a strong foundation in it and there after you can switch over other languages.How to choose a resource for learning →My first piece of advice will be that carefully look upon the available free resources present on the internet before paying courses. You can look for top rated courses / resources but the reality is that not everyone's teaching will be suitable or helpful for one's learning. Regarding this try to preview the course material, watch their way of explaining concepts and evaluate based on your type of learning things.
At present times, there are lot of individual creators creating materials like courses for their audience to upskill themselves. If you carefully watch means at the beginning everyone's resource will make us feel satisfied to buy but that is not the actual point to proceed. Few people teaches almost 70–80 percent of the content in their You-tube channels and build courses with few percent exclusivity. Some people only showcase minimal concepts in the profile forums and rest complete stuffs will be present in their courses. Those has to be evaluated by means of their teaching videos which are already posted.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>finally relearned python</title><link>https://dev.to/celineai/finally-relearned-python-31oc</link><author>celine</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 13:15:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[kinda a big deal for me, especially in college, i was always so nervous and anxious with my programming skills and struggled to understand the concept. regardless, it's one step forward in reteaching myself how to code and getting back in my programming journey.if you have any other tips, tutorials, or resources to get back into coding, let me know! <3 ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Debug Webhooks Without Headaches: The Webhook Monitor Every Developer Needs</title><link>https://dev.to/fyoussef/how-to-debug-webhooks-without-headaches-the-webhook-monitor-every-developer-needs-1k82</link><author>Filipi Youssef</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 12:41:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you've ever worked with webhooks, you know that debugging these requests can be a real nightmare.

However, as datasets grow exponentially in size and complexity, the performance limitations of Python's built-in data structures (like lists, dictionaries, and tuples) become apparent. While excellent for general-purpose programming, they are not optimized for large-scale numerical operations. Python lists, for instance, store heterogeneous data, meaning each element can be of a different type, requiring individual memory allocations and type checking during operations. This overhead significantly slows down computations on vast amounts of data.To overcome these bottlenecks, the data science community embraced "vectorized operations." This paradigm shifts from explicit looping over individual elements to applying operations on entire arrays or columns of data at once. This approach leverages highly optimized, often compiled, underlying implementations, leading to dramatic performance improvements.NumPy Arrays: The Foundation of Numerical ComputingAt the heart of high-performance numerical computing in Python lies NumPy, and its fundamental data structure, the  (N-dimensional array). Unlike Python lists, NumPy arrays store homogeneous data (all elements are of the same type) contiguously in memory. This contiguous storage is crucial because it allows CPUs to perform operations on chunks of data efficiently, leveraging modern processor architectures and SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions.Consider a simple arithmetic operation on a large dataset:You'll observe that the NumPy operation completes significantly faster. This efficiency is why NumPy arrays are the bedrock for almost all numerical and scientific computing libraries in Python. For more details on NumPy, refer to the NumPy Documentation.Pandas DataFrames and Series: Structured Data PowerhouseBuilding directly on NumPy arrays, Pandas provides powerful, high-level data structures for structured data: the DataFrame and Series. A Pandas Series can be thought of as a single column of data, essentially an enhanced NumPy array with an associated label (index). A DataFrame, then, is a collection of Series objects, sharing a common index, forming a tabular data structure with labeled rows and columns.While Pandas DataFrames don't implement columnar storage in the same strict sense as some other systems (like Apache Arrow, which we'll discuss next), they conceptually operate very efficiently on columns. Each column in a DataFrame is typically a NumPy array, allowing Pandas to leverage NumPy's vectorized operations for common data manipulation tasks like filtering, aggregation, and transformations. This design makes Pandas incredibly efficient for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.Common operations in Pandas, such as , , or , are highly optimized under the hood, making complex data workflows surprisingly fast. The design allows for intuitive and readable code while maintaining strong performance for most data science tasks. Dive deeper into its capabilities with the Pandas Documentation.Apache Arrow: The Game Changer for Interoperability and PerformanceAs data science workflows became more complex, involving multiple languages and systems (e.g., Python for analysis, Spark for big data processing, R for statistics), the need for an efficient and standardized in-memory data format emerged. This led to Apache Arrow.Apache Arrow is not a data structure library in the traditional sense, but rather a language-agnostic, columnar memory format. It defines a standard way to represent tabular data in memory, enabling zero-copy data exchange between different systems and programming languages (Python, R, Java, C++, etc.). This eliminates the costly serialization/deserialization overhead that typically occurs when data moves between different environments.Libraries like Pandas (especially with its newer "Arrow backend" option) and Polars leverage Arrow to significantly improve performance and reduce memory footprint, particularly when dealing with mixed-type data or large strings. For instance, converting a Pandas DataFrame to an Arrow Table is efficient because both are designed to work with columnar data principles.This seamless conversion highlights Arrow's role in facilitating high-performance data pipelines across disparate tools. Learn more about its capabilities at the Apache Arrow Documentation.Polars: The Blazing-Fast DataFrame Library (Rust-powered)Polars is a relatively new, yet incredibly powerful, DataFrame library that has gained significant traction for its blazing speed and memory efficiency. Written in Rust, it leverages the performance benefits of a compiled language while providing a Pythonic API. Polars is built natively on Apache Arrow, which is a key factor in its high performance.Key features of Polars include: Operations are not executed immediately but are instead built into a query plan, allowing Polars to optimize the execution order and reduce redundant computations. Polars encourages an expressive, functional style of data manipulation, which can lead to more readable and performant code.Native Apache Arrow Integration: By using Arrow as its in-memory format, Polars benefits from efficient data storage and zero-copy operations.Let's look at a comparative benchmark between Pandas and Polars for a moderately complex data transformation:The performance difference, especially on larger datasets, can be substantial, making Polars an attractive option for data scientists dealing with performance-critical applications. Explore its capabilities further in the Polars Documentation.Narwhals: Unifying DataFrame APIs (Future Outlook)The proliferation of high-performance DataFrame libraries like Pandas and Polars, while beneficial for performance, can introduce fragmentation in the Python data ecosystem. This is where Narwhals comes in. Narwhals is an emerging project that aims to provide a unified API across different DataFrame libraries. Its goal is to allow developers to write code that is agnostic to the underlying DataFrame implementation, making it easier to switch between backends (e.g., Pandas, Polars, Modin, cuDF) based on specific performance needs or deployment environments without rewriting significant portions of the codebase.By offering a common interface, Narwhals simplifies the development of libraries and applications that need to be compatible with various DataFrame frameworks, fostering greater interoperability and reducing the learning curve for users transitioning between them. You can follow its progress on the Narwhals GitHub repository.Conclusion: Choosing the Right Tool for the JobThe evolution of data structures in Python, from fundamental built-in types to highly optimized libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Apache Arrow, and Polars, reflects the increasing demand for efficient data processing in modern data science. Each of these tools offers distinct advantages and caters to specific use cases:Standard Python Data Structures (lists, dictionaries): Ideal for general-purpose programming, small datasets, and when data heterogeneity is a requirement. They offer flexibility but lack the performance for large-scale numerical computations. The fundamental building block for numerical computing. Essential for any task involving large, homogeneous numerical arrays where vectorized operations are key to performance.Pandas DataFrames and Series: Your go-to for structured data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis. They provide a rich, intuitive API built on top of NumPy's efficiency, suitable for most medium to large datasets. Crucial for interoperability and efficient data exchange between different systems and languages, especially in big data ecosystems. It underpins many modern high-performance libraries. An excellent choice when raw speed and memory efficiency are paramount, particularly for very large datasets or complex transformations. Its Rust backend and lazy evaluation offer significant performance gains over traditional Pandas for certain workloads.Understanding these specialized data structures and their underlying mechanisms is vital for any Python developer looking to optimize their data processing workflows and stay at the forefront of the data science ecosystem. The right tool, applied judiciously, can unlock significant performance improvements and enable the tackling of increasingly complex data challenges.

Before diving into code, let's outline the prerequisites for integrating Thordata's proxies with Python:Create a Thordata Account: Sign up on Thordata's platform to obtain your credentials and access dashboardUnderstand Proxy Endpoints: Thordata provides region-specific endpoints (e.g., us.proxy.thordata.net, eu.proxy.thordata.net) and country-specific zonesChoose Connection Protocol: Decide between HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS5 based on your application needsSecurity Configuration: Set up IP whitelisting or authentication methods in your Thordata dashboard
  
  
  Essential Python Libraries for Proxy Integration
For this guide, we'll leverage the following libraries:requests: The de facto standard for making HTTP requests in Python
aiohttp: For asynchronous request handling in high-throughput scenarios
proxybroker: A utility for managing proxy pools and rotation
BeautifulSoup: For parsing scraped HTML contentBasic GET Request with Requests Library
Let's start with a foundational example that demonstrates how to route a simple HTTP request through Thordata's residential proxy:import requests
import json
from random import choice

def get_proxy_from_thordata(region="us"):
    """Fetch a residential proxy from Thordata's regional pool"""
    # In a real implementation, this would call Thordata's API
    # or use pre-configured proxy strings
    proxy_configs = {
        "us": "http://user_us:pass123@us.proxy.thordata.net:8080",
        "eu": "http://user_eu:pass456@eu.proxy.thordata.net:8080",
        "asia": "http://user_asia:pass789@asia.proxy.thordata.net:8080"
    }
    return proxy_configs.get(region, proxy_configs["us"])

def make_request_with_proxy(url, region="us"):
    """Execute a GET request through Thordata's residential proxy"""
    proxy = get_proxy_from_thordata(region)
    proxies = {
        "http": proxy,
        "https": proxy
    }

    try:
        response = requests.get(url, proxies=proxies, timeout=10)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.text
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Request error: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    target_url = "https://httpbin.org/ip"
    us_response = make_request_with_proxy(target_url, "us")
    print("US Proxy Response:")
    print(json.dumps(json.loads(us_response), indent=2))

    eu_response = make_request_with_proxy(target_url, "eu")
    print("\nEU Proxy Response:")
    print(json.dumps(json.loads(eu_response), indent=2))

That one question has haunted developers and DevOps engineers alike. On the surface, both get the job done — but under the hood, they’re built for different worlds. In this blog, we’ll break down the real-world differences between Bash and Python scripting, their  and most importantly — when you should use each.Scripting, at its core, is about giving your computer a to-do list — a set of instructions it can follow automatically, step by step. Think of it like writing a recipe: instead of telling a person how to cook a dish, you’re telling the computer how to carry out a task.Let’s be honest — nobody enjoys doing the same repetitive tasks every day. Whether it’s moving files, cleaning up logs, or setting up your dev environment for the 10th time this week, it gets old fast. That’s where scripting comes in — and it’s a total game changer.Scripting is like giving your computer a checklist and saying, “You handle this. I’ve got better things to do.” Once you write a script, it takes over the boring stuff — no complaints, no forgetfulness, just results. Scripting helps you reduce errors, save time, and focus on the stuff that actually matters. Trust me the moment you start automating even the smallest tasks, you’ll wonder how you ever lived without it.Some of the most popular scripting languages include: for system tasks on Unix/Linux. for more complex automation and cross-platform scripting. for client-side browser scripting. for automation in Windows environments.Bash () is the default shell on most Linux distributions and macOS. It’s designed to interact directly with the operating system. Think of Bash as a glue that connects other CLI tools together.
  
  
  What Makes Bash So Special?
Bash isn’t just that black box you type commands into — it’s much more than that. It’s like your backstage pass to the entire operating system. With Bash, you’re not just running commands, you’re  them,  them, and  them like a pro.Think of Bash as your personal assistant for the command line. You can write a small script to do boring, repetitive things — like moving files, cleaning up folders, or checking system health — and Bash will handle it all for you, without breaking a sweat.The real magic? Bash lets you glue together tons of other tools — like , , , , , and . On their own, these tools are powerful. But with Bash, you can make them work together like a well-rehearsed orchestra. One command filters, another searches, another renames — and Bash makes it all flow smoothly in just a few lines of script.
  
  
  Advantages of Bash Scripting
Perfect for interacting with the OS, managing files, users, permissions, services, etc.Executes quickly with minimal overhead — ideal for short scripts or quick fixes.Easily connects tools like , , , , etc. in one-liners or scripts.No need for setup — just open the terminal and start scripting.Bash is often the go-to choice for scheduled tasks and sysadmin routines.
  
  
  Few Common Bash Commands :
 — it is a command that is used to List Directory , Files and also Folders in long format (with all the permissions , Date and size)
cd — it is a command which is used to change a directory or also move from one directory to an another .
Use  to go up one level, or  alone to return to your home directory. — this is used to create a New Empty File . For example shown below it creates a text file called  — its the most commonly used command when your required to make a Directory because without making a directory you can’t survive. Now in the below example it creates a () called  — used to remove Files or Directories recursively and forcefully . But be carefull because there’s  — this is used to Copy Files or Folders into your desired location or directory. Use  for copying directories:  — . You can also use it to rename: mv oldname.txt newname.txt .
mv data.csv archive/data.csv
 — commanly used to display the content or Print something in the Terminal. For an example  would be printed onto the screen.
 — this command is used to view File Contents with opening the file itself .
 — command mainly used for searching or matching. Used for Text in files, file names present inside a directory.

  
  
  Python Scripting — The Swiss Army Knife of Automation
Python wasn’t built solely for scripting, but it’s one of the best tools out there when it comes to getting things done efficiently. It’s like that reliable friend who somehow knows how to fix your Wi-Fi, automate your spreadsheet, and build a website — all before lunch. The beauty of Python lies in its readability and simplicity. You don’t need to write 20 lines of code to do something basic. Want to rename 500 files? Scrape data from a website? Monitor a folder for changes? Python makes all of that feel incredibly straightforward.And thanks to its massive library ecosystem — from  and  for file handling, to  for working with APIs, to  for data wrangling — you rarely start from scratch. It’s versatile enough to automate daily tasks, yet powerful enough to build entire applications. Whether you’re a beginner writing your first script or a pro building robust automation pipelines, Python is the kind of language that scales with you — and always has your back.
  
  
  What Makes Python So Special?
Python is special because it’s simple, powerful, and insanely versatile. The code reads like plain English, so it’s easy to learn and easy to remember. Whether you’re automating tasks, building websites, crunching data, or diving into AI — Python can handle it all. Plus, with thousands of libraries, there’s a tool for pretty much anything you want to do. It’s the kind of language that grows with you, no matter where you start.
  
  
  Advantages of Python Scripting
 Clean syntax that feels like English — great for beginners and large teams. From file handling to web scraping to machine learning — there’s a library for almost everything.Perfect for logic-heavy tasks, data manipulation, API integration, and beyond.Python scripts run smoothly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
You can start with a simple script and grow it into a full-blown application.
  
  
  Few Common Python Commands :
 — command used to displays text or variables on the screen.
 — commonly used to take input from the user_._
name = input("What's your name? ")
 — Returns the length of a string, list, or other data types.
 — Tells you the data type (e.g., int, str, list).
 —Generates a sequence of numbers, often used in loops_._
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
, ,  — command widely used for decision-making in your script. It’s outcome solely depends on the conditions.
if age < 18:
    print("Minor")
else:
    print("Adult")
 — Used to define functions (reusable blocks of code).
def greet():
    print("Hello!")
 — Lets you use built-in or used to extract the external modules
import math
print(math.sqrt(25))
 — Adds an item to the end of a list_._
fruits = ["apple", "banana"]
fruits.append("orange")
 — Opens a file for reading or writing
file = open("data.txt", "r")

  
  
  Python vs Bash — Side-by-Side Example
files and count how many lines contain the word “error”#!/bin/bash
for file in *.log; do
  echo "$file: $(grep -i error "$file" | wc -l) error(s)"
done
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import glob
for file in glob.glob("*.log"):
    with open(file, "r") as f:
        count = sum(1 for line in f if "error" in line.lower())
    print(f"{file}: {count} error(s)")
  Bash is concise, efficient, and perfect for file processing.  Python is clearer, easier to maintain, and handles edge cases more gracefully.
  
  
  When to Use Bash vs Python: The Right Tool for the Right Task
Let’s be real — when you’re diving into scripting, it’s not about which language is better. It’s about which one makes your life easier for the task you’re tackling.If you’re working closely with the , Bash is often your best friend. It’s great for those quick-and-dirty tasks like moving files around, starting or stopping services, scheduling cron jobs, or stringing together commands with pipes. Bash is fast, lightweight, and made for interacting with the shell. It really shines in , like managing EC2 instances, running shell scripts during deployments, or automating things through AWS CLI.Now, if your task involves more logic or data crunching, Python is the way to go. Need to parse a massive log file? Read and write JSON or CSV? Call APIs? Handle errors gracefully and keep your script maintainable? Python does all that and more. It’s clean, powerful, and has a huge set of libraries that make complex tasks feel simple. It’s also great if your script might evolve into something bigger over time — like a command-line tool, automation framework, or even a web service.Sometimes, though, the smartest move is to use . For example, you might use a Bash script to keep an eye on your system, and then let Python jump in when there’s real work to do — like processing data or sending out a notification. It’s a powerful combo: Bash handles the grunt work, Python brings the brains.So here’s the bottom line: when you’re doing quick shell-level stuff. when your logic gets heavier or your task gets smarter.Choosing between Bash and Python isn’t about picking a winner — it’s about using the right tool for the job.  is unbeatable for quick, low-level system tasks and chaining CLI commands like a pro.  steps in when your scripts need structure, logic, or cross-platform flexibility. In reality, the best automation setups often use , playing to each of their strengths. So instead of asking “Which one should I learn?”, ask “When should I use which?” Master both, and you won’t just write scripts — you’ll build smart, elegant solutions that actually make your life easier.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🌿 Herbal Remedy Advisor – Grandma&apos;s Wisdom Meets LLMs</title><link>https://dev.to/avradeep_nayak_fa8d5f6995/herbal-remedy-advisor-grandmas-wisdom-meets-llms-2loj</link><author>Avradeep Nayak</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 07:37:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[“Because your grandma’s tea deserves LLM-level respect.”A few weeks ago, while sipping ginger tea during a coding session (thanks, Grandma!), a curious thought struck me:

You wouldn't just recall each word in isolation; you'd focus on key details, discarding less important information, and linking events together to understand the narrative. This is similar to what Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) strive for in the world of artificial intelligence, but traditional RNNs often struggle with remembering information over long periods. This is where Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks come in, offering powerful solutions to this "long-term memory" problem.These specialized RNN architectures are crucial for processing sequential data – anything with an order, like text, speech, time series data (stock prices, weather patterns), and even video. They overcome the limitations of basic RNNs by incorporating sophisticated "gates" that control the flow of information, allowing them to learn long-range dependencies – connections between events separated by significant time gaps.Understanding the Core Concepts:  LSTMs and GRUsThink of a basic RNN as a conveyor belt carrying information. Each item on the belt is processed, but the belt's capacity to remember earlier items is limited; they get progressively overwritten. LSTMs and GRUs add a more complex system of storage and retrieval, like adding memory compartments to our conveyor belt.LSTM: The Master of Memory ManagementAn LSTM network uses three gates: Decides what new information should be stored in the cell state (our long-term memory).  It acts like a filter, selecting only the most relevant information. Decides what information should be removed from the cell state.  Think of this as discarding irrelevant or outdated details. Decides what information from the cell state should be passed on to the next step in the network.  It carefully selects and shares only the necessary information.This intricate system allows LSTMs to remember information for extended periods, even across long sequences, making them adept at handling complex patterns. Imagine remembering the beginning of a long sentence while processing the end; an LSTM can do this effectively.GRU: A Simpler, Yet Powerful AlternativeThe GRU, a more recent innovation, simplifies the LSTM architecture by combining the forget and input gates into a single "update gate." This makes GRUs computationally less expensive and faster to train than LSTMs, while still retaining impressive performance in many applications. While less complex, GRUs still possess the ability to selectively remember and forget information, effectively learning long-range dependencies.The Significance and ImpactThe ability to effectively process sequential data has revolutionized several fields. LSTMs and GRUs are responsible for many breakthroughs in:Natural Language Processing (NLP):  Machine translation, sentiment analysis, text summarization, and chatbot development all benefit significantly from these architectures.  They allow for a deeper understanding of context and meaning in text.  Accurately transcribing spoken language, even in noisy environments, is made possible by the ability of LSTMs and GRUs to model the temporal dynamics of speech.  Predicting future values based on historical data, whether it's stock prices, weather patterns, or energy consumption, is enhanced by these networks' capacity for long-term memory.  Understanding and classifying actions within video sequences relies heavily on these architectures' ability to process temporal information.Challenges, Limitations, and Ethical ConsiderationsDespite their power, LSTMs and GRUs face challenges: Training these models, especially on large datasets, can be computationally expensive and time-consuming.Vanishing/Exploding Gradients:  While mitigated compared to basic RNNs, the problem of gradients becoming too small or too large during training can still hinder performance. Understanding  an LSTM or GRU makes a particular prediction can be difficult, hindering trust and accountability in certain applications.  If the training data contains biases, the model will learn and perpetuate those biases, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.  Careful data curation and bias mitigation techniques are crucial.Looking Ahead: The Future of LSTMs and GRUsLSTMs and GRUs have undeniably transformed the landscape of AI. While challenges remain, ongoing research focuses on improving their efficiency, interpretability, and robustness. We can expect further advancements in their applications, leading to more sophisticated and impactful AI systems across various industries. The ability to effectively manage and utilize information over time, a core strength of these architectures, will continue to be a cornerstone of future AI development. As we continue to push the boundaries of what's possible with these powerful tools, careful consideration of ethical implications and responsible development will be paramount to ensuring their beneficial application for society.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>📝 Beginner-Friendly Guide &quot;Minimum Deletions to Make String K-Special&quot; LeetCode 3085 (C++ | Python | JavaScript)</title><link>https://dev.to/om_shree_0709/beginner-friendly-guide-minimum-deletions-to-make-string-k-special-leetcode-3085-c-python-2dn7</link><author>Om Shree</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 01:25:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ |  | Greedy + Frequency AnalysisA string  consisting of lowercase letters.A string is  if for every pair of characters ,  in the string:|freq(word[i]) - freq(word[j])| <= k

YAML is beautiful for humans to write — but a nightmare to audit or analyze at scale. You’ve likely seen it everywhere:
    • Kubernetes manifests
    • GitHub Actions
    • CircleCI, ArgoCD, and moreBut try to ask simple questions like:
    • “Which containers expose port 80?”
    • “Where did we forget resources.limits.memory?”
    • “Are any services still using HTTP?”You’re stuck with , , or writing ad-hoc scripts that break when a field is missing or nested differently.YAML as a language has various problemsThe following article is a great summary of the problems with YAML:YamlQL is a CLI + Python tool that converts YAML into DuckDB tables, so you can query it like a database.✅ Key Features
    • discover — See the schema of your YAML file
    • sql — Run manual SQL queries over YAML
    • ai — Use AI to generate SQL (schema-aware, no data sent)
    • Supports nested structures, lists, dicts
    • Works locally, offline, and fastLet's see how YAMLQL works with an example 
  
  
  The Sample Deployment file
Lets consider the following kubernetes deployment manifest for an exampleBefore writing the query - you need to know how this YAML file is converted as a table and its schema So first we use the discover modeyamlql discover deployment.yaml

  
  
  🧠 Write SQL queries Manually
Now we know the Table and the field names and the Schema of this file - Let us put it to useLets write some SQL queries to get the data from YAML
  
  
  👨‍💻 Write SQL queries with AI - without sharing your actual Data
As English has become the new programming language in the ERA of Software 3.0 Let us do some Vibe Code and write Natural Language Query which would be sent to AI along with the  - without sharing the actual dataLLM is used here only for converting the NLP to SQL with schema as an input

In this blog, we’ll build a simple SMS OTP Sender using your , , and a little bit of  magic. It’s a fun way to learn about messaging automation, APIs, and port forwarding — especially if you're a beginner in backend or ethical hacking!
  
  
  🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Termux (Android) – Linux terminal emulator for Android.Termux: API – Provides access to Android’s native APIs like SMS.Python – To build a simple backend script.Flask – Lightweight Python web framework.Cloudflare Tunnel / Ngrok – To expose the local server to the internet.
  
  
  📦 Step 1: Setup Termux on Android
Install Termux from F-Droid (not Play Store):pkg update && pkg upgrade
pkg install python
pkg install termux-api
pip install flask

Also install Termux API app from F-Droid (important).
  
  
  Step 2: Write the SMS Sender in Python
Create a file called sms_sender.py:import json
import os
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer

class RequestHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_POST(self):
        if self.path == "/send-sms":
            content_length = int(self.headers["Content-Length"])
            post_data = self.rfile.read(content_length)
            data = json.loads(post_data)

            phone = data.get("phone")
            otp = data.get("otp")

            if phone and otp:
                command = f'termux-sms-send -n {phone} "Your OTP is {otp}"'
                print(f"Executing: {command}")  # Debugging statement

                # Use os.system to execute the command
                result = os.system(command)

                # Check the result code
                if result == 0:
                    print("✅ SMS sent successfully!")
                    self.send_response(200)
                    self.end_headers()
                    self.wfile.write(json.dumps({"message": "OTP Sent"}).encode())
                else:
                    print("❌ Failed to send SMS! Error code:", result)
                    self.send_response(500)
                    self.end_headers()
                    self.wfile.write(json.dumps({"error": "Failed to send SMS"}).encode())
            else:
                self.send_response(400)
                self.end_headers()
                self.wfile.write(json.dumps({"error": "Invalid data"}).encode())

server_address = ("", 8080)  # Running server on port 8080
httpd = HTTPServer(server_address, RequestHandler)
print("📡 Termux SMS Server running on port 8080...")
httpd.serve_forever()

  
  
  🌐 Step 3: Port Forward with Cloudflare Tunnel
When you're building a local project, your services usually run on your machine and are only accessible from your own device. For example:Your frontend (React, etc.) runs on localhost:3000Your backend server runs on localhost:8080Your database runs on localhost:5432But here’s the problem:
These  ports are not accessible from outside your machine.So, how do you access your local app from another device? Or share it with a team member or webhook service?Buy a , deploy your services, and make them public.Or — use  with tunneling services like Cloudflare Tunnel or ngrok.
  
  
  🔁 What is Port Forwarding?
Port forwarding is a method to expose a specific port (running locally) to the internet, by tunneling it through a public URL.
  
  
  👉Example: Cloudflare Tunnel for Port Forwarding
Let’s say we’re working on a full-stack app that runs locally like this: → Frontend (React app) → Backend Server (API) → PostgreSQL DatabaseHere's a visual representation of our local setup:All services are running locally.We use a  to expose these local ports to the outside world.This tunnel creates a  that anyone can access — just like a real deployed app.
  
  
  To forward your local Flask server (running on port 8080), use:
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8080

  
  
  🧪 Step 4: Test the SMS API
Here once the Cloudflare Tunnel was set up and pointing to to my Termux Flask server, we need a way to trigger rigger the OTP sending from my backend. So I created an API route that would generate an OTP, save it in the database for short duration, and send a request to my Termux SMS server to deliver the OTP to the user’s phone.📡 Make a POST request to the Termux serverI exposed the Termux Flask server (running on my phone) using Cloudflare Tunnel. Then, I hit this public URL with a simple POST request:POST https://yourname.trycloudflare.com/send-sms
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "number": "9876543210",
  "message": "Your OTP is 6789"
}
You can do this using Postman, or directly from terminal with curl:curl -X POST https://yourname.trycloudflare.com/send-sms \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"number": "9876543210", "message": "Your OTP is 6789"}'
And boom 💥 — the message is sent directly from my Android phone using Termux’s native termux-sms-send command.This worked great for me during testing — no need for third-party SMS providers or paid APIs. I used this method to  in my full-stack app.In this blog, I built a DIY SMS OTP sender using just:An Android phone running TermuxA Python + Flask server to send SMS via termux-sms-sendA Cloudflare Tunnel to expose the local API publiclyI also connected this setup with a backend (Node.js + MongoDB) that:Verifies it securely when submittedThis project avoids third-party SMS services, is perfect for local development/testing, and helps you understand port forwarding, automation, and full-stack OTP systems using open tools.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tracking Kenya’s External Debt Using Python, PostgreSQL, and Grafana</title><link>https://dev.to/dkkinyua/tracking-kenyas-external-debt-using-python-postgresql-and-grafana-1h61</link><author>Denzel Kanyeki</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 21:35:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We always hear about Kenya’s external rising debt in headlines, but how fast is it growing?

In nearly every case, a deeper technical review reveals a few common culprits.1. Poor Development Practices
Custom modules and extensions are often built without regard for scalability or performance. Common issues include:Redundant or copy-pasted code across modulesInefficient use of the ORM, especially writing in a way that triggers unnecessary queries, resulting in N+1 query problemsIgnoring the power of  or failing to use , , or  properlyThese are more than just bad habits—they are performance killers, especially when the database grows into the millions of records.
Performance issues aren’t just about code. They also stem from weak infrastructure and maintenance strategies:No proper database partitioning or shardingLack of scheduled VACUUM or ANALYZE jobs, which can make PostgreSQL queries slower over timePoor logging and monitoring, meaning slow queries go undetected until it's too lateInadequate scaling of workers or improper tuning of the Odoo configuration parameters (e.g., , , etc.)Odoo needs a robust DevOps backbone, especially in production environments with heavy concurrent users.Practical Tips to Optimize Odoo at Scale
If you’re running Odoo with large datasets or anticipating future growth, consider the following:Avoid excessive computed fields, or make them store=True with proper indexingMove heavy operations to scheduled jobs (e.g., ) instead of doing them in the UI regularly using tools like  or Odoo's built-in logs to analyze slow queries and add missing indexes (e.g., splitting  or  by year)Review third-party modules—they’re often the source of silent inefficiencies
Odoo is not inherently slow.But like any powerful tool, it requires discipline, expertise, and long-term thinking to scale well in complex business environments. If you invest in quality development, proactive DevOps, and performance monitoring from day one, Odoo can absolutely meet the demands of a modern enterprise.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Real world lessons from building MCP servers</title><link>https://dev.to/airbyte/real-world-lessons-from-building-mcp-servers-28le</link><author>Quinton</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 19:30:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[MCP servers are everywhere now. Whether you are using tools like Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, Cursor, Cline, Postman, you name it; If a developer can plug in an MCP to it, they will. Having built a number of MCP servers recently at Airbyte, and running my own side hustle at mycaminoguide.com as an AI agent for the past year, I've learned a few things about what it really takes to build and run MCP servers. 
  
  
  Know the main components of an MCP server.
This might sound obvious, but knowing the main components of an MCP server is incredibly helpful as you build your own. It gives you a roadmap on what and how you want to implement services, and will save you significant time trying to custom code your own solutions when you should have used native MCP decorators and support.
Tools are functions clients can call to perform an action. Tools are what show up in something like Cursor. When designing an MCP, I typically start by thinking about the domain I want to work in. eg: functions a developer needs when working with my product, or calendar functions etc. From there I have a scope and can decide what actaul functions are available. If I find I am exceeding the domain, I typically create a separate MCP server. 
Resources allow your client to return specific data based on parameters. Resources are very helpful if your MCP service is going to perform some sort of query on a backend system. eg: My MCP offers a calendar service and I want to pass in a particular date to get availability.

Prompts are messages templates that include parameterized values that you can pass to an LLM to perform a query. I use prompts extensively within the PyAirbyte MCP server to allow the user to specify source and destination connectors. The MCP server then uses a consistent prompt and the OpenAI chat completion API to query the vector store for highly relevant results.
  
  
  Understand the Transports
Clients support different transports depending on your deployment model. If you are running locally, the transport is going to be stdio. Effectively, you configuring your mcp to execute a shell command to run a local file. I use stdio MCP services that I have built to help me automate frequent daily tasks such as checking the health of pipelines, looking at usage analytics, slack summaries etc from within Claude Desktop. I wouldn't recommend stdio for broader developer community facing tools. There is too much local config that the user needs to manage.Server Sent Events, or SSE, is the original transport for remote MCP servers. MCP servers built using this model require you to run a server such as Express or FastMCP to serve endpoints, both a POST and GET. Remote servers in general are not supported by Claude Desktop, but are supported in Cursor and Cline, although there are limitations, which I'll cover shortly. If you are starting to write MCP servers today, I would not recommend using SSE transports as they have been deprecated in favor of Streamable transports.Streamable HTTP transports removes the need to create two endpoints - a POST and GET - like you see in SSE transports and are slightly more complex to set up. Once you do have them configured though, there is a lot of benefits through scalability and resumable connections. In addition, they can work stateless meaning you can deploy them quite easily on Vercel vs. SSE services which you need to deploy on something like Railway or Heroku. The downside is that the Streamable HTTP transport is very new with Client tool vendors only now implementing it. There are positive sign though that this transport will become the most dominant. I've already see Claude Code implement a  parameter, for example.Most of my MCP development is done in python. Thankfully, there is a rich ecosystem of libraries available to that make working with MCP much easier. FastMCP is the defacto standard. It is fully spec-compliant, supports streaming transport, and is easily deployed.It's been interesting to see OpenAI support a competitors 'standard' (Anthrophic were the original authors of the MCP spec). As a heavy user of the Responses API in mycaminoguide.com, I've been excited to see that models can now use MCP servers to perform tasks. Currently the implementation doesn't feel very natural and there it's overly complex but the idea of an agent or model using my MCP server has me watching this space closely. Google is also pushing the same approach with their Agent SDK. 
  
  
  Not all Clients are created equal
When it client tools such as Claude Desktop, Cline, and Cursor, etc, the level of support for the MCP spec, and how this is represented in the mcp.json a user needs to add to connect a server can often lead to wasted time trying to figure out why an error is being raised. I have not found a centralized place where these differences are listed. Here are the ones I have encounteredLocal MCP server support: Claude Desktop, Cline, Cursor, Claude Code. Remote MCP server support: Cline, Cursor, Claude CodeRemote MCP server passing env in mcp.json: Cursor, Claude CodeThe remote MCP server with support for passing environment variables is a interesting case. For example, we just deployed an MCP server for PyAirbyte. This server uses openAI and a vector store to generate data pipelines. It is deployed on Heroku. As part of the client config, we require that you pass in your OpenAI API key. This works great within Cursor, but unfortunately it not supported in Cline. You can, of course, add values to a serverside .env file, but we did not want to do this due to the risk of someone spamming the MCP server and running up a bit OpenAI bill.MCP protocols are still evolving. Change is constant and can be frustrating when building services. Sometimes logging errors are not very helpful, and LLMs like ChatGPT often send you down a rabbit hole, only to find out that the spec has changed and the LLM doesn't have the most recent information. Vibe coding MCP servers can be an exercise in frustration. I hope these tips help you get started in building your own MCP servers and avoid some of the pitfalls I made when starting out. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Python Coding Stack: I Want to Remove Duplicates from a Python List • How Do I Do It?</title><link>https://www.thepythoncodingstack.com/p/remove-duplicates-from-python-list</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 18:36:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Another short article today to figure out ways to remove duplicate values from a list. The ideal solution depends on what you really need.Well, we need a list first–ideally, one with duplicate values. So, let's assume we have an online queue (line). But some people put their name in the queue more than once:All code blocks are available in text format at the end of this article • #1 • The code images used in this article are created using Snappify. [Affiliate link]Note how James and Kate were eager to ensure they were in the queue, so they put their name down twice.Removing Duplicates: The Ugly WayI was initially tempted not to include this section, but I changed my mind, as you can see. You can come up with several algorithms to perform this task "manually". It's only a few lines of code. Here's one option:You have a  empty list ready to collect unique names. Next, you iterate using  and add names to  if they don't appear in the rest of the original list. Note that I'm using slicing in the  statement to slice the list from  to the end of the list.Let me show you another option. I'll discuss the outputs from these two manual versions later in this article:This time, you reverse the list so you can loop through the names in reverse order. The  doesn't start as an empty list this time but as a copy of the original reversed list.In the loop, you remove names from  if the name appears later in the reversed list. A reminder that the  list method only removes the first occurrence of an item. It doesn't remove all of them.Both algorithms remove duplicates. Great. But compare the output from the two versions. The difference between these output lists gives a clue to what's coming next.But I won't dwell on these versions any longer.and PS: there are better versions of manual algorithms for this, but that's not the point of this first section, so let's move on!Removing Duplicates: The Set WayWhen you learn about data structures, you learn about the various characteristics they have. Then, you start comparing data structures based on these characteristics. For example, lists, dictionaries, tuples, and strings are all iterable. But lists and dictionaries are mutable, whereas tuples and strings are immutable. And lists, tuples, and strings are all sequences, but dictionaries are not–they're mappings. You can read more about some of these categories here: The Python Data Structure Categories SeriesAnd some data structures enforce uniqueness while others don't. Lists, as you've seen above, can have several equal items–in the example above, you have several strings that are equal to each other.However, sets are a Python data structure that can only have unique values:So, the easiest way to remove duplicates from a list is to cast it into a set:Or, if you prefer the output to still be a list, and perhaps you also want to overwrite the original variable name, then you can write the following:Now, that was easy! Much better than the several lines of code in the previous section.However, there's an issue. If this is a queue of customers, then the order in which they joined the queue is somewhat important, I would say!Note how the new  list, the one without duplicates, no longer maintains the original order of the people within it. James was the first to join the queue, but Andy appears to have moved to the front when you removed duplicates.Note that this also happened with the first of the manual algorithms in the previous section.Sometimes, you don't care about the order of the elements in a list. If that's the case, you can cast the list into a set and then back into a list to remove duplicates.But sometimes, the order matters. It certainly matters when dealing with a queue of customers. Let's look at another option.Removing Duplicates: The Dictionary WayIf you haven't, now is a good time to read it. Like this one, it's a short article, so it won't take you too long.So, you now know that since Python 3.7, there's a guarantee that the order of insertion of items in a dictionary is maintained. And dictionary keys must also be unique–you cannot have the same key appear twice in a dictionary.Therefore, if you could create a dictionary from the elements in the list , you would remove duplicates but also maintain the order. And there's a dictionary class method for that:You create a dictionary from the list . The items in the list become keys, and each key has a default value of . You can customise this default value, but you don't need to in this case, as you'll see in the next paragraph.Great, you removed duplicates while maintaining order since dictionaries maintain order. The dictionary is created by iterating through the list, which explains why this version maintains the order of the items. But you don't want a dictionary, and you don't care about the values within it. So, you can cast this dictionary back into a list. You only keep the keys when you cast a dictionary into a list:You've now removed duplicates from the list  maintained the original order by converting the list into a dictionary and then back into a list.Simple–once you know this idiom.Do you want to join a forum to discuss Python further with other Pythonistas?

Items in a set must be hashable objects. And keys in a dictionary must also be hashable. Therefore, you can't use these techniques if you have a list that includes non-hashable objects, such as a list that contains other lists.You may need to remove duplicates from a list in Python.Don't write your own algorithm. Life's too short for that.If you don't care about the order of the items in the list, cast the list into a set and then back into a list: If you  care about the order, create a dictionary from the list using  and then cast it back into a list: list(dict.fromkeys(queue)).And the set and dictionary routes to removing duplicates are also more efficient than the manual ones shown above.

LangGraph is a framework that enables us to build complex AI workflows, utilizing nodes (tasks) and edges (connections) with built-in state management.
This guide will walk you through building an AI-powered customer support agent that classifies priorities, identifies relevant topics, and determines whether to escalate or auto-reply.Let’s face it — “AI agents” can sound like the robots that will take over your boardroom. In reality, they are your proactive sidekicks that can streamline complex workflows and eliminate repetitive tasks. Think of them as the next evolutionary step beyond chatbots: they do not just simply wait for prompts; they , coordinate multiple steps, and adapt as they go.Back in the day, crafting a “smart” system meant juggling separate models for language understanding, code generation, data lookup, you name it, and then duct-taping them together. Half of your time used to vanish in integration hell, whereas the other half you spent debugging the glue.Agents flip that script. They bundle context, initiative, and adaptability into a single orchestrated flow. It is not just automation; it is intelligence with a mission. And thanks to such frameworks as , assembling an agent squad of your own can actually be… dare I say, fun?  
  
  
  What Is LangGraph, Exactly?
LangGraph is an innovative framework that revolutionizes the way we build complex applications involving Large Language Models (LLMs).Imagine that you are conducting an orchestra: every instrument (or “node”) needs to know when to play, how loud, and in what sequence.  in this case** is your baton, giving you the following:: It employs a graph-like structure with nodes and edges, enabling developers to design flexible, non-linear workflows that accommodate branches and loops. It mirrors complex decision-making processes resembling the way neural pathways might work.
: LangGraph offers built-in tools for state persistence and error recovery, simplifying the maintenance of contextual data across various stages within an application. It can effectively switch between short-term and long-term memory, enhancing interaction quality thanks to such tools as Zep.
: With LangGraph, LLM agents can easily collaborate with external services or databases to fetch real-world data, improving the functionality and responsiveness of your applications.
: Beyond automation, LangGraph accommodates human interventions in workflows, which are crucial for decision-making processes that require analytical oversight or ethical consideration.Whether you are building a chatbot with real memory, an interactive story engine, or a team of agents tackling a complex problem, LangGraph turns headache-inducing plumbing into a clean, visual state machine.To start with LangGraph, you will need a basic setup that typically involves installing such essential libraries as langgraph and langchain-openai. From there, you can define the nodes (tasks) and edges (connections) within the graph, effectively implementing checkpoints for short-term memory and utilizing Zep for more persistent memory needs.When operating LangGraph, keep in mind the following:: Leverage the powerful graph structure to account for potential workflow branches and interactions that are not strictly linear.
Interact with Tools Thoughtfully: Enhance but do not replace LLM capabilities with external tools. Provide each tool with comprehensive descriptions to enable precise usage.
Employ Rich Memory Solutions: Use memory efficiently, be mindful of the LLM's context window, and consider integrating external solutions for automatic fact management.Now that we have covered the basics of LangGraph, let's dive into a practical example. To achieve this, we will develop an AI agent specifically designed for customer support.This agent will receive email requests, analyze the problem description in the email body, and then determine the request's priority and appropriate topic/category/sector.So buckle up and let's go!To begin, we need to define what a 'Tool' is. You can think of it as a specialized "assistant manager" for your agent, allowing it to interact with external functionalities.The  decorator is essential here. LangChain simplifies custom tool creation, meaning that first, you define a Python function, and then apply the  decorator.Let's illustrate this by creating our first tool. This tool will help the agent classify the priority of an IT support ticket based on its email content:Excellent! Now we have a prompt that instructs the AI to receive the email body, analyze it, and classify its priority as High, Medium, or Low.That’s it! You have just composed a tool your agent can call!Next, let's create a similar tool to identify the main topic (or category) of the support request:Now we need to create a state, and in LangGraph this little piece is, kind of, a big deal.Think of it as the central nervous system of your graph. It is how nodes talk to each other, passing notes like overachievers in class.“A state is a shared data structure that represents the current snapshot of your application.”In practice? The state is a structured message that moves between nodes. It carries the output of one step as the input for the next one. Basically, it is the glue that holds your entire workflow together.Therefore, before constructing the graph, we must first define the structure of our state. In this example, our state will include the following:The user’s request (email body)
The identified topic (category)It is simple and clean, so you can move through the graph like a pro.
  
  
  Nodes vs. Edges: Key Components of LangGraph
The fundamental building blocks of LangGraph include  and : They are the operational units within the graph, performing the actual work. A node typically consists of Python code that can execute any logic, ranging from computations to interactions with language models (LLMs) or external integrations. Essentially, nodes are like individual functions or agents in traditional programming.
: Edges define the flow of execution between nodes, determining what happens next. They act as the connectors that allow the state to transition from one node to another based on predefined conditions. In the context of LangGraph, edges are crucial in orchestrating the sequence and decision flow between nodes.To grasp the functionality of edges, let’s consider a simple analogy of a messaging application: are akin to users (or their devices) actively participating in a conversation.
 symbolize the chat threads or connections between users that facilitate communication.When a user selects a chat thread to send a message, an edge is effectively created, linking them to another user. Each interaction, be it sending a text, voice, or video message, follows a predefined sequence, comparable to the structured schema of LangGraph’s state. It ensures uniformity and interpretability of data passed along edges.Unlike the dynamic nature of event-driven applications, LangGraph employs a static schema that remains consistent throughout execution. It simplifies communication among nodes, enabling developers to rely on a stable state format, thereby ensuring seamless edge communication.
  
  
  Designing a Basic Workflow
Flow engineering in LangGraph can be conceptualized as designing a state machine. In this paradigm, each node represents a distinct state or processing step, while edges define the transitions between those states. This approach is particularly beneficial for developers aiming to strike a balance between deterministic task sequences and the dynamic decision-making capabilities of AI. Let's begin constructing our flow by initializing a StateGraph with the TicketState class we defined earlier.: Nodes are fundamental building blocks, defined to execute such specific tasks as classifying ticket priority or identifying its topic.Each node function receives the current state, performs its operation, and returns a dictionary to update the state:The classify_priority_node and identify_topic_node methods will change the TicketState and send the parameter input.: Define edges to connect nodes:The classify_priority establishes the start, whereas the identify_topic determines the end of our workflow so far.Compilation and Execution:  Once nodes and edges are configured, compile the workflow and execute it.Great! You can also generate a visual representation of our LangGraph flow.If you were to run the code up to this point, you would observe a graph similar to the one below:This illustration visualizes a sequential execution: start, followed by classifying priority, then identifying the topic, and, finally, ending.One of the most powerful aspects of LangGraph is its flexibility, which allows us to create more complex flows and applications. For instance, we can modify the workflow to add edges from START to both nodes with the following line:This change will imply that the agent executes classify_priority and identify_topic simultaneously.Another highly valuable feature in LangGraph is the ability to use conditional edges. They allow the workflow to branch based on the evaluation of the current state, enabling dynamic routing of tasks.Let's enhance our workflow. We will create a new tool that analyzes the content, priority, and topic of the request to determine whether it is a high-priority issue requiring escalation (i.e., opening a ticket for a human team). If not, an automated response will be generated for the user.Furthermore, if the request is determined to be of low or medium priority (leading to an "auto_respond" decision), we will perform a vector search to retrieve historical answers. This information will then be used to generate an appropriate automated response. However, it will require two additional tools:Now, let's define the corresponding nodes for those new tools:The conditional edge will then use the output of the make_decision node to direct the flow:If the make_escalation_decision tool (via decision_node) results in "auto_respond", the workflow will proceed through the rag node (to retrieve examples), then to generate_reply (to craft the response), and finally to execute_action (to log the auto-response).Conversely, if the decision is "escalate", the flow will bypass the RAG and take generation steps, moving directly to execute_action to handle the escalation. To complete the graph by adding the remaining standard edges, do the following: For this project, the dataset we used to power the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was sourced from the Customer Support Tickets dataset on Hugging Face. The dataset was filtered to include exclusively the items categorized as  and restricted to  entries. It ensured that the RAG system retrieved only highly relevant and domain-specific examples for technical support tasks.At this point, our graph should resemble the one below:When you execute this graph with an email that results in a high priority classification and an "escalate" decision, you will see the following response:At the same time, a request that is classified as low priority and results in an "auto_respond" decision will trigger a reply resembling the one below:Not entirely. There a few bumps to watch out for: Be careful with sensitive info — these agents require guardrails.
 Some advanced setups require serious resources.
 LLMs can occasionally make things up (still smarter than most interns, though).
 The same input might return different outputs, which is great for creativity, but tricky for strict processes.However, most of these weak spots can be managed with good planning, the right tools, and — you guessed it — a bit of reflection.LangGraph turns AI agents from buzzwords into real, working solutions. Whether you want to automate customer support, handle IT tickets, or build autonomous apps, this framework makes it doable and, actually, enjoyable.Have you got any questions or feedback? Let’s talk.

If you don't know Meshtastic, it is a LoRa (Long Range) radio messaging system that uses inexpensive boards (ESP32, nRF52, etc...). It's all license free so you don't have to be ham radio operator to use it. Messages are all packet-based and can travel several km (even hundreds) depending on antennas, terrain conditions, etc... all with tiny output power involved.
Note: the picture is directly taken from their docs, GPLv3 license



Like the name implies, the network created is a mesh type. Each element in the network is called a node, and what they can also do is to relay messages, i.e. re-transmit them. This extends the packet range a lot. I think this picture will give you a good idea on how it works:
Note: the picture is directly taken from their docs, GPLv3 license



There are public and private channels determined by crypto keys.Lots of other things could be said about Meshtastic but I want to concentrate this post on what the title states.Meshtastic has an Android and iOS app, a web UI, APIs, etc. The Android app works quite well. The web UI is different: it's ephemeral, which means that if you refresh the page you are going to lose the messages which have already been downloaded from the board.  The boards, in-fact, can only store a certain number of messages due to their limited memory and once the limit is reached it's overwritten. I like to think of this as a circular array.Anyway, I have to say this app is improving lately and there are alternatives, but I wanted to learn more about Meshtastic, FastAPI, Svelte and SQLModel, so I am trying to implement one myself.fastmeshapi is a project that involves several components:There are also other minor dependencies which I'm importing along the way but these are the most important ones.
A subset of the API endpoints. There are 43 at the moment of writing this post.



The purpose is to build a persistent, high performance Meshtastic web app that provides a REST API as well.This first video shows you the initial version of the dashboard and some of the FastAPI endpoints.Let me know in the comments if you already know Meshtastic or if you'd like to try it in the future.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Build a AI Voice Agent with Gemini API</title><link>https://dev.to/sagarkava/build-a-ai-voice-agent-with-gemini-api-jlf</link><author>Sagar Kava</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 16:22:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Learn how to build a fully functional, real-time AI voice agent you can talk to, using Google's GeminiAPI and VideoSDK for robust AI Voice Agent.Ever wondered how you could talk to an AI, not by typing, but in a natural, real-time conversation? Imagine building a virtual doctor for initial consultations, an AI tutor that explains complex topics, or even a friendly companion to chat with.Today, we're going to build just that. We'll create a fully functional, real-time AI voice agent that you can talk to directly in your browser. The agent will listen to you, understand what you're saying, and respond with a natural-sounding voice, all in real-time.We will use the power of Google's  for lightning-fast conversational AI, and the robust infrastructure of  to handle real-time audio streaming and session management. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a working app with a React frontend and a Python backend that you can customize and expand upon.Here's a quick peek at what we're building:Before we start, make sure you have the following ready:Node.js (v16+) and npm/yarn – For our React frontend. – For our FastAPI backend. – To get your Auth Token for session management. – To get your free Gemini API key from AI Studio.
  
  
  How to Get Your VideoSDK Auth Token
Your application needs an Auth Token to connect to VideoSDK. Once you're on the dashboard, find "API Keys" in the left-hand menu. You'll see your API Key and a "Generate Token" button. Click it to create a new, temporary token. Copy the generated token. This is the value you'll use for  in your backend and  in your frontend. For development, this token is fine, but for production apps, you should generate tokens securely from a server.
  
  
  How to Get Your Google Gemini API Key
We will use Google AI Studio to get a free API key. This is the simplest way to start building with Gemini. Sign in with your Google account. Look for and click the  button, usually located in the top left corner. In the pop-up window, click Create API key in new project. Your new API key will be displayed. Copy it immediately and save it somewhere safe. This is the value you'll use for  in your backend  file.We'll keep things simple with a monorepo structure./gemini-voice-agent
├── client/         
└── server.py       Let's start by creating our Python server, which will manage the agent's connection to the meeting.
  
  
  1. Create virtual environment & install dependencies
In your project root, set up a Python virtual environment.
python3  venv venv
venv/bin/activate  
pip  pip
pip fastapi uvicorn python-dotenv The  package conveniently bundles the core agent SDK with the necessary google plugins.
  
  
  2. Create  file in the project root
Create a file named  in the root of your project and add your secret keys.# .env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_from_ai_studio
VIDEOSDK_TOKEN=your_videosdk_auth_token_here
This file contains all our backend logic. It will expose two endpoints: one to make the agent join a meeting and one to make it leave.
  
  
  Breaking Down the Backend
: This class defines our agent's personality and behavior. The  parameter in  is the system prompt that tells Gemini its role.  and  are lifecycle hooks for greetings and goodbyes.: This is the core component from the VideoSDK Agent SDK. It manages the agent's connection to the VideoSDK meeting room, handling all the complex real-time communication protocols.: This plugin configures the connection to Google's Gemini API, including the model, voice, and response parameters.: The  method is a blocking call that runs as long as the agent is in the meeting. We use FastAPI's  to run it without freezing our API, allowing us to immediately return a response to the frontend.: This dictionary is a simple way to keep track of running sessions. This allows our  endpoint to find and gracefully shut down the correct agent.Now let's build the user interface where we can talk to our agent.
  
  
  1. Create a new React + TypeScript project
Navigate to your project root and use Vite to scaffold a new app.
npm create vite@latest client  react-ts
client
npm We need the VideoSDK React SDK for meeting controls,  for icons, and TailwindCSS for styling.npm  @videosdk.live/react-sdk lucide-react tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init 
  
  
  3. Configure Tailwind CSS
Update  to tell Tailwind which files to scan for classes.Then, add the Tailwind directives to your main CSS file.
  
  
  4. Create a frontend  file
In the  directory, create a  file for your client-side environment variables.# client/.env
VITE_VIDEOSDK_TOKEN=your_videosdk_auth_token_here
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
 Vite requires environment variables exposed to the browser to be prefixed with .
  
  
  5. Build the React User Interface
Replace the contents of  with the following code. This component will handle creating a meeting, joining it, inviting the agent, and playing the agent's audio.Meeting ID: YouAIAIAgent is joining...LeaveGemini AI Voice Agent
        Start a Conversation
      
  
  
  Breaking Down the Frontend
: This is the top-level wrapper from the VideoSDK React SDK. It provides the meeting context to all child components.: This powerful hook gives us access to all essential meeting functions like , , , and the list of .: This hook provides real-time information about a specific participant, including their , which contains the raw audio data. Component: This small component is crucial. It takes the agent's , gets the  using the  hook, and pipes it into a standard HTML  element to be played.: When the user joins the meeting, a  hook fires a  request to our  backend endpoint. The cleanup function of the  fires when the user leaves, calling the  endpoint to ensure the agent is removed from the call and server resources are freed.It's time to see our creation in action! You'll need two separate terminal windows.
  
  
  1. Start the Backend Server
In your first terminal, at the project root:venv/bin/activate 


uvicorn server:app  0.0.0.0  8000 
  
  
  2. Start the Frontend App
In your second terminal, navigate to the  directory:Now, open your browser and go to . Click "Start a Conversation," allow microphone permissions, and start talking to your very own AI agent!Congratulations! You've successfully built a fully functional, real-time AI voice agent using Google Gemini and VideoSDK. You've learned how to:  Set up a Python backend to manage an AI agent.  Connect to Google's Gemini Realtime API for conversational AI.  Use VideoSDK to handle real-time audio streaming and session management.  Build a React frontend to interact with the agent in a browser.This is just the beginning. You can now customize the agent's system prompt, personality, and even give it new tools and capabilities.If you build something cool with this, we'd love to see it. Share it on X/Twitter and tag @video_sdk!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>почему я бросил python и начал html</title><link>https://dev.to/vova_dev/pochiemu-ia-brosil-python-i-nachal-html-45m8</link><author>Usmanbek-Vladimir Ahtirskiy</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 15:08:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Раньше я занимался python и много о нём узнал.

I didn’t expect to enjoy a calculus book this much. Shocking, I know. But that’s exactly what happened with .Can calculus feel intuitive? Even fun? From the first few pages? For me, the answer was yes. (Okay, from page 8 to be exact.)Why This Book Clicked for MeAs part of my self-study, I’m reviewing select chapters from the books I work through. This post covers Chapter 1 of  by Seth Braver.Before I stumbled on , I tried a few limit-based calculus books and textbooks, but none of them spoke to me. Luckily, there’s no shortage of calculus material these days, so it’s easy to shop around and try different sources.Braver’s book grabbed me right away. The early focus on infinitesimals, the tight writing, and the emphasis on intuition won me over. I even caught myself smiling more than once. Rare for a math book.Chapter 1 starts with : “an infinitely small number, smaller than any positive real number, yet greater than zero.” One early example shows how a circle, imagined as a polygon with infinitely many infinitesimal sides, leads to the familiar area formula πr². If your geometry or trig is rusty, don’t worry - it still makes sense. Braver then uses the same idea to show how curves appear straight on a small enough (infinitesimal) scale, which is the heart of differential calculus.Things really clicked for me in the section titled A Gift From Leibniz: d-Notation. Braver’s explanation of  shows how it captures infinitesimal change in a way that just makes sense. It helped me understand why derivatives represent slopes and rates in a way I could explain to a 10-year-old. Working through the derivative of x² from first principles was also deeply satisfying. Practically speaking, Chapter 1 covers:how they help us define rates of changethe geometric meaning of derivativesthe elegant dy/dx notation from Leibnizwhy we ignore higher-order infinitesimals like (dx)² or du * dvand a first-principles derivation of the derivative of x² The chapter ends with two powerful tools: the power rule and linearity properties. These let you compute derivatives of polynomials using just basic mental math.The writing is sharp and often funny, in a math kind of way. There’s even a cameo by the Sumerian beer goddess Ninkasi, who helps explain rate of change and derivatives using a vat of beer. It sounds quirky, but it works.The book’s style, clarity, and focus on intuition made me want to keep going. That’s not something I’ve felt with many math books. If you’re following along or just curious about studying calculus again, I recommend giving Chapter 1 a shot. It’s not always light reading, and the exercises are essential, but it might click for you like it did for me. Chapter 1 is available for free on the author’s site, so you can explore it before deciding whether to dive in. If you do decide to dive into the book, here are a few tips to get the most out of it:If you’re rusty on pre-calculus (I was), make sure you’ve got slope, rate of change, the point-slope formula, and the slope-intercept form down cold before the  section on page 10. For that, Seth Braver’s other book Precalculus Made Difficult has excellent material on those topics. You can probably get through it in a day.Read slowly, with a pen or pencil in hand. Write in the margins (get a paperback copy). It might feel painfully slow at times (pun intended), but it’s a recipe for deeper understanding.The book includes answers to many exercises and is great for self-study. But the solutions are compact, so I recommend using Grok or ChatGPT to expand on them and deepen your understanding.Once you’ve finished the chapter and exercises, check out the author’s YouTube videos that go along with the book. They’re criminally underrated and oddly hard to find. You might enjoy them as much as I do. For topics that are hard to retain, try spaced repetition with active recall. Anki works great for that, or use whatever tool you prefer.
Chapter 1 sealed the deal. This is the calculus book I’m sticking with. Looking forward to seeing how Braver develops the ideas from here.More to come. Stay tuned. I’m not affiliated with the author. I just really enjoy the book and wanted to share it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Unlocking Unprecedented Benefits with AI-Powered Web Applications.</title><link>https://dev.to/sparkout/unlocking-unprecedented-benefits-with-ai-powered-web-applications-gpo</link><author>AI Development Company</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 12:58:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the relentless march of digital evolution, web applications have transitioned from static information hubs to dynamic, interactive platforms.

This includes automating data entry, generating detailed reports, classifying incoming emails, routing customer requests to the correct department, and managing inventory updates based on sales data. Such automation boosts productivity and reduces the likelihood of human error.AI-Powered Web Design Tools: AI is transforming the web design process itself. Tools like Wix ADI (Artificial Design Intelligence) and Adobe Sensei can analyze user requirements, brand guidelines, and content to automatically generate responsive layouts, suggest design elements, and optimize visuals. This empowers users with limited coding or design skills to create professional-looking websites quickly and provides designers with a powerful assistant for brainstorming and rapid prototyping.3. Smarter Decision-Making and Advanced AnalyticsAI's unparalleled ability to process and analyze vast datasets empowers businesses with deeper insights and data-driven decision-making capabilities.Predictive Analytics: AI models can forecast future trends, user behavior, and market shifts with remarkable accuracy. This enables businesses to make proactive decisions regarding sales predictions, demand forecasting, inventory management, and resource allocation. For instance, an e-commerce platform can predict peak demand for certain products and optimize its supply chain accordingly.User Behavior Analysis: AI-driven analytics go beyond simple metrics, providing deep insights into how users interact with your web application. By tracking click-through rates, navigation paths, time spent on pages, and engagement with specific features, AI can uncover patterns and pain points that inform design improvements, feature optimization, and content strategy.Real-Time Decision-Making: AI algorithms can analyze market demand, competitor pricing, and user engagement in real-time to dynamically adjust product pricing, marketing campaigns, or content delivery strategies for maximum impact. This agility allows businesses to respond instantly to market changes and optimize performance on the fly.Sentiment Analysis: AI can analyze user comments, reviews, and social media mentions to gauge sentiment about products, services, or the brand itself. This provides invaluable feedback, allowing businesses to address customer concerns proactively and refine their offerings based on public perception.4. Fortified Security and Fraud PreventionIn an age of escalating cyber threats, AI has emerged as a crucial ally in bolstering the security posture of web applications, moving beyond reactive measures to proactive defense.Real-time Threat Detection: AI algorithms can continuously monitor web traffic, user behavior, and system logs to identify anomalies and suspicious patterns that indicate potential cyberattacks, such as DDoS attacks, malware infections, or unauthorized access attempts. This real-time detection allows for swift response, often automatically blocking malicious activity before it can cause significant damage.Fraud Prevention: AI is highly effective in detecting and preventing various forms of fraud, including payment fraud, fake accounts, and unusual transaction patterns. By analyzing historical data and user behavior, AI can flag suspicious activities that deviate from learned normal behavior, safeguarding financial transactions and user data.Adaptive Learning for New Threats: Traditional security systems rely on known signatures. AI-powered security solutions, however, continuously learn from new attack vectors and evolving threat landscapes. This adaptive learning enables them to detect zero-day threats (previously unseen attacks) and automatically update protection mechanisms in real-time, providing a dynamic and resilient defense.Behavioral Biometrics: AI can analyze subtle user behaviors, such as typing patterns, mouse movements, and navigation rhythms, to create unique behavioral profiles. Deviations from these profiles can flag potential unauthorized access attempts, adding an extra layer of security beyond traditional passwords.5. Significant Cost Reduction and Return on Investment (ROI)While initial investment in AI integration can be substantial, the long-term cost savings and increased revenue streams make it a highly worthwhile endeavor.Reduced Manual Labor and Operational Costs: Automation of repetitive tasks (customer support, data entry, content generation, testing) directly translates to reduced labor costs. Businesses can reallocate human resources to more complex, strategic, and creative tasks, maximizing their value.Faster Development Cycles and Time-to-Market: AI tools that assist with coding, debugging, and testing accelerate the development process. This faster time-to-market means products and features can launch sooner, leading to earlier revenue generation or operational savings.Optimized Resource Usage: AI can intelligently manage and optimize cloud infrastructure resources in real-time, ensuring that web applications only consume what's necessary. This dynamic resource allocation can lead to significant cost savings on cloud hosting and infrastructure.Increased Conversion Rates and Customer Retention: The enhanced personalization, improved UX, and efficient support driven by AI directly contribute to higher user engagement, increased conversion rates, and better customer retention. These factors directly impact revenue growth and build long-term customer loyalty.Reduced Errors and Rework: AI's ability to detect errors in code and automate quality assurance processes minimizes bugs and the need for costly rework after deployment, saving both time and money.Driving Innovation and Competitive AdvantageBeyond the tangible benefits, AI infusion inherently propels web applications into a new realm of innovation, granting businesses a distinct competitive edge.Unique Selling Propositions: AI capabilities can differentiate a web application in a crowded market, offering features and experiences that competitors cannot easily replicate without similar AI integration.Enabling New Business Models: AI opens doors to entirely new services and business models, such as predictive subscription services, AI-driven consulting platforms, or highly personalized digital marketplaces.Faster Adaptation to Market Changes: With AI providing real-time insights and automation, businesses can adapt more quickly to changing market trends, customer demands, and competitive pressures, maintaining their relevance and leadership.Key Considerations for AI IntegrationWhile the benefits are profound, successful AI integration requires careful planning:Data Quality and Quantity: AI models are only as good as the data they're trained on. High-quality, sufficient, and unbiased data is paramount.Ethical AI and Bias: Ensuring AI models are fair, transparent, and free from bias is critical to maintaining user trust and avoiding unintended consequences.Integration Complexities: Integrating AI capabilities into existing web application architectures can be complex, requiring skilled developers and careful planning.Talent and Expertise: Building and maintaining AI-powered web applications demands specialized skills in data science, machine learning, and AI engineering. Businesses may need to upskill existing teams or acquire new talent.Content Preview: Content editors might miss the "what you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG) preview familiar in traditional CMS. Solutions like visual editors or preview environments are crucial to bridge this gap.The Future is IntelligentThe journey of AI in web applications is just beginning. As AI technologies continue to advance, we can anticipate even deeper levels of personalization, more sophisticated automation, and highly intuitive interfaces that seamlessly anticipate and fulfill user needs.

The time to infuse intelligence into your web presence is now.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>WharpDOS – I Built an ARP-Based DoS Tool in Python to Learn Network Attacks (Ethically)</title><link>https://dev.to/lucifron28/wharpdos-i-built-an-arp-based-dos-tool-in-python-to-learn-network-attacks-ethically-in2</link><author>Ron Vincent Cada</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 12:57:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As a student specializing in Web and Mobile Application Development, I’ve always been curious about how systems behave beyond the frontend and backend layers — especially when it comes to network security.So, I gave myself a challenge:Build a working denial-of-service (DoS) tool that manipulates the network layer — not through floods or DDoS — but by exploiting trust in local communication.
The result? WharpDOS — a Python-based ARP spoofing & network disconnection tool, designed for ethical testing and educational purposes.ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is what devices use to map IP addresses to MAC addresses in local networks.
It’s fast, but it’s also vulnerable — any device can send a forged ARP reply, poisoning the ARP cache of others.This is what ARP spoofing does:Tells the victim, “Hey, I’m the router.”

Tells the router, “Hey, I’m the victim.”

Then intercepts or disrupts traffic.
In WharpDOS, I went a step further:Instead of forwarding traffic like a man-in-the-middle tool, I drop it — creating a simple, silent, non-congestive denial of service.
✅ ARP Network Scanning (via scapy)
✅ Interactive Whitelisting (prompt trusted IPs)
✅ ARP Spoofing Engine (without packet forwarding)
✅ Real-Time Monitoring (detect new devices as they connect)
✅ Threaded CLI UI using rich and prompt_toolkit
✅ ARP Table Restoration on Exit (clean shutdown)

Developed and tested on Arch Linux.
Requires sudo/root access to send raw packets.
Feel free to clone, test, and modify it — in a safe, legal environment.Disclaimer
WharpDOS is intended strictly for:
    Educational cybersecurity practice
    ethical hacking simulations
    Controlled lab environments❌ Do not use this tool on networks you do not own or have permission to test.
❌ Unauthorized deployment can result in disciplinary or legal consequences.
How ARP works under the hood, and how fragile it canHow to design a CLI tool that interacts live with the networkThe importance of graceful exits in tools that manipulate protocol stateHow ethical hacking tools can be powerful learning projects
What’s Next?I’d love to:
    Explore packet forwarding (to simulate MitM instead of DoS)
    Add logging and interface selection menus
    Try converting the logic to a GUI Qt version for more visualizationHi! I’m Ron Vincent Cada, an IT student focused on fullstack development and slowly diving into cybersecurity.
I love building practical tools that help me (and hopefully others) learn how systems really work.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>2025 eCommerce Trends That Could Make or Break Your Business</title><link>https://dev.to/tylermorganaqe/2025-ecommerce-trends-that-could-make-or-break-your-business-3641</link><author>Faizan Saiyed</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 12:36:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The way people shop has changed — and it’s still changing fast. From scrolling on social media to voice shopping with Alexa or Siri, customers are buying differently than they did just a few years ago.By 2027, over 22% of all retail purchases will happen online, and businesses that don’t keep up with the latest eCommerce trends 2025 could be left behind.If your store still works the same way it did in 2018 — without mobile optimization, no personalization, or missing features like video shopping or real-time recommendations — you’re not just losing sales. You’re slowly becoming invisible to your customers.Let’s break down why staying updated with eCommerce development services and digital trends isn’t just a good idea — it’s essential for growth, survival, and brand relevance.Why Following eCommerce Trends 2025 Matters More Than EverToday’s buyers expect speed, personalization, and easy experiences. They don’t want to search endlessly for what they need or fill out long forms just to buy a product.So when a competitor offers smarter search, quick checkout, and personalized suggestions — guess who wins?That’s why trends like AI-based recommendations, voice shopping, and AR/VR product experiences are no longer just nice-to-haves. They’re now basic customer expectations.And if you don’t match them? You risk losing your customers to brands that do.5 Major Shifts Changing Online Shopping in 2025
Brands now use AI to recommend the right products, show dynamic content, and even adjust pricing based on user behavior. If your store feels generic, you’ll lose interest — and customers.
Most people shop from their phones. Many use voice assistants. If your store isn’t mobile-friendly or voice-optimized, your bounce rate goes up, and your sales go down.2025 eCommerce Trends That Could Make or Break Your Business
Online buyers want to try products before buying — virtually. AR fitting rooms and 360° product views help reduce returns and build trust.
Customers shop across devices, apps, and platforms. A disconnected experience (like a cart that disappears between mobile and desktop) leads to lost sales.
Modern consumers care about your values — sustainability, transparency, and ethics matter. Brands that don’t communicate these clearly lose credibility.What Happens If You Don’t Adapt?
The cost of ignoring these trends goes beyond slow growth. It can seriously harm your business: Customers expect convenience and smart experiences. If they don’t get it from you, they’ll buy from someone else. Outdated websites, clunky checkouts, and irrelevant offers drive away repeat customers. Platforms like Google, Instagram, and TikTok now prioritize shoppable content, video, and voice. If you’re not aligned, you won’t show up. Manual order processing, inventory mistakes, and disconnected systems waste time and money. Automation and integration reduce those risks.Expensive Ads, Low Returns: Paid campaigns only work if your landing pages and customer experience are optimized. Otherwise, you’re paying more for fewer conversions. Today’s market is loud and crowded. To stand out, you need more than just products — you need a smart, fast, and value-driven experience.How to Future-Proof Your eCommerce BusinessThe good news? You don’t have to figure it out alone. With the right  you can upgrade your store, personalize user journeys, and integrate advanced features without starting from scratch.From AI recommendations and mobile-first design to AR integration and real-time analytics, everything can be tailored to fit your business goals and your customer needs.Curious About the Full Breakdown?We’ve covered each of these 2025 trends, what they mean for your business, and how you can implement them to avoid falling behind.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Building an AI-Powered Content Recommendation Engine for Social Media Apps with Python and MongoDB</title><link>https://dev.to/utsav_shukla/building-an-ai-powered-content-recommendation-engine-for-social-media-apps-with-python-and-mongodb-53m8</link><author>Utsav Shukla</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 12:28:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In 2025, user engagement in social media apps is largely driven by personalized experiences. Users expect content feeds that align with their preferences, behaviors, and even moods. At the core of these personalized experiences lies the content recommendation engine, a system powered by machine learning and real-time data.If you're working in social media application development, building your own recommendation system can be a game-changer. In this tutorial, we’ll walk through how to build a scalable, AI-driven content recommendation engine using Python and MongoDB, ideal for integration into any modern social platform.This tutorial is also relevant for backend teams at any social media app development company, social network development company, or teams delivering custom social media app development services.Why Build Your Own Recommendation Engine?
Most social media platforms rely on third-party APIs or rule-based content systems. However, these lack adaptability and personalization. By building your own engine, you gain:Full control over content prioritizationThe ability to improve suggestions over timeScalable infrastructure using your app’s own user dataIntegration with your frontend UI/UX for real-time responsesA powerful recommendation engine is now a standard feature across leading platforms. Any serious media App Development company or developer building for the social media space should consider building one from the ground up.Python for implementing machine learning logicMongoDB as our document-based databasescikit-learn / pandas / NumPy for data processing and modelingFlask to expose the engine via API endpointsStep 1: Setting Up Your MongoDB Database
First, define your users and content collections.Sample Schema – users
json
Edit
  "_id": "user123",
  "interests": ["tech", "AI", "health"],
  "recent_activity": ["post567", "post890"]
Sample Schema – content
Copy
{
  "tags": ["AI", "tech"],
  "comments": 45,
}
This schema gives us a flexible base for implementing recommendations based on user preferences and content tags. These models are commonly used by any scalable social networking app development services provider.Step 2: Content Similarity Matching Using TF-IDF
Install the necessary libraries:bash
Copy
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn flask pymongo
Create a content vectorizer based on tags and categories:python
Copy
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import pandas as pddef build_similarity_matrix(content_df):
    content_df['combined'] = content_df['tags'] + ' ' + content_df['category']
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
    tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(content_df['combined'])
    return cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix)
You can fetch content data from MongoDB and pass it to this function to build your similarity score matrix.Step 3: Matching User Interests to Content
Now, let’s match the user’s interests with the content tags.python
Copy
def recommend_content(user_profile, content_df, similarity_matrix):
    liked_tags = ' '.join(user_profile['interests'])
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
    user_vec = vectorizer.fit_transform([liked_tags])
    content_vec = vectorizer.transform(content_df['combined'])
    similarity_scores = cosine_similarity(user_vec, content_vec)content_df['score'] = similarity_scores[0]
recommended = content_df.sort_values('score', ascending=False).head(5)
return recommended
A well-optimized social media app development company would typically wrap this function into an endpoint for frontend integration.Step 4: Build a Flask API Endpoint
python
Edit
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
from pymongo import MongoClientapp = Flask()
client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client['social_app']
content_collection = db['content']
user_collection = db['users']@app.route('/recommend/', methods=['GET'])
def get_recommendations(user_id):
    user_profile = user_collection.find_one({"_id": user_id})
    content_df = pd.DataFrame(list(content_collection.find()))
    sim_matrix = build_similarity_matrix(content_df)
    recommendations = recommend_content(user_profile, content_df, sim_matrix)
    return jsonify(recommendations.to_dict(orient='records'))if  == "":
    app.run(debug=True)
Test this with Postman or your frontend app by hitting the /recommend/ endpoint.Step 5: Future Enhancements
Once the base engine is working, you can add:User clickstream analysisCollaborative filtering (via matrix factorization)Session-based recommendationsAI sentiment analysis for comments and captionsReal-time feedback loops for improving predictionsThese advanced techniques are frequently employed by top social media app development services firms and internal teams at platforms with high engagement.Why This Matters for Developers and Product Teams
Whether you’re an indie developer or working at a social media app development company, understanding how to build recommendation engines is critical. In today’s AI-first world, users expect platforms to serve them hyper-relevant, smart content from Day 1.Even more, a robust recommendation engine:Supports content discoverabilityEnables better monetization and ad targetingFor any growing platform, the investment in social media application development with smart recommendation features is not just a technical upgrade. It’s a user experience necessity.Final Thoughts
AI-powered content recommendation systems are the backbone of successful social media platforms in 2025. They offer users personalized journeys and help creators get discovered faster.By using Python and MongoDB, developers can build lightweight, scalable, and intelligent systems that serve millions, whether you’re launching a startup or working with a full-scale social network development company.If you're planning your next big platform or upgrading an existing one, make sure you're backed by a technically sound, AI-ready media App Development company or capable in-house dev team.Let your app be the one that gets smarter with every scroll.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Amazon USA | How Review Scraping Boosted Tech Brand CX</title><link>https://dev.to/datazivot1/amazon-usa-how-review-scraping-boosted-tech-brand-cx-2ak8</link><author>DataZivot</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 12:05:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

This approach is not recommended for production-grade systems without thorough understanding of the underlying code generated by your prompts. All generated output should be reviewed, tested, and validated for correctness and security.Glitch Runner is a 2D platformer game created using Python, Pygame and Amazon Q CLI. I decided to use this idea because the concept of controlled chaos might give another twist to traditional platformer games. In Glitch Runner, the "glitches" are random and require the player to adjust to a new situation every few seconds. Every effect changes the difficulty the game plays and can turn the precision platforming into a creative way of parkouring through the glitches. It seemed to be the ideal setting that would test the abilities of Amazon Q to manage both game-logic and rich visuals.I started with prompting the description of the game, giving the Q the concepts and the mechanics that I wanted.I
  
  
  Break Features into Smaller Tasks
I asked Q to create features one-by-one to increase its efficiency in creating the logic behind those features.Help me implement reversed gravity my player class.
I want you to implement a glitch that shakes the user screen and also the platforms
Once the features where working, I asked Q to improve them and provided my insights on what to improve.The pixelation glitch feels like nothing has changed. Can you increase the distortion so itThe background is too visually distracting. Can you make it simpler keeping the difficulty intact?

  
  
  Debugging using Problem-Solution Format
When I'm trying Q to fix a bug, I first laid out what was wrong and what I am expecting to be the result.During reversed gravity glitch, the character floats out of the screen and doesn’t  Can you fix that by putting screen boundaries?
Amazon Q did a great job in developing this whole game by doing all these tasks:: Q helped in breaking down the play classes, game loops, and glitch engines into reusable modules.: The glitches comes with altered inputs for the users, Q did a great job in syncing the supposed inputs with their respective glitches.Basically, Amazon Q saved me from creating a project too long. However, there were notable prompts there that were more complicated than the other logics.: laid out expected animation folders for idle, run, jump, fall, and wall slide, saving me the trouble of guessing file structure.: With a single prompt, Q hooked up sound effects to player death, win conditions, and glitch events.But the most surprising automation came when I tested PyInstaller and accidentally built an old version of the game. I asked Q to run the updated version directly and it executed the script from my directory like a local assistant. This deeply integrated behavior highlighted how Q goes beyond code generation to support full project workflows.
  
  
  Examples of Smart AI-Generated Solutions
The development of Glitch Runner using Amazon Q was a great example of how the present-day AI can be directly beneficial to the entire process of game creation. Q was also useful in the brainstorming of features, bug fixing, organization of my assets, and even running scripts. Even the design of the glitch system; features that thrive on randomness was shaped by the constraints of a prompt-driven development process, making its unpredictability a natural outcome of how the game was built.This shows that our limited thoughts could, with the proper prompts, turn into a full-fledged game based on your imagination.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Telemedicine at Scale: Architecting a HIPAA-Compliant, AI-Enabled Microservices HMS</title><link>https://dev.to/nzcares/telemedicine-at-scale-architecting-a-hipaa-compliant-ai-enabled-microservices-hms-3amc</link><author>Nzcares</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 11:24:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Not Every Hospital Looks Like an App—Until It Has ToMost hospitals weren’t built for real-time video consults, AI chatbots, or cloud-native operations.But telemedicine changed that.Healthcare software today juggles multiple systems, global compliance, and non-stop uptime—making it more than just a tech project.

: Clients report 40–60% better ROI by prioritizing accurate outputs.
: Use lighter models for simple queries; o3-pro for complex analysis.
: Pay a premium per token to save on error-handling and rework.

  
  
  Why Reliability Matters More Than Raw Speed in Enterprise AI
When OpenAI announced its o3-pro model, the industry took notice—not because it was the fastest or the flashiest, but because it doubled down on . As I’ve been advising enterprise clients for years, this strategic shift reflects the reality of large-scale AI deployments: reliable, accurate outputs drive business value more effectively than raw performance benchmarks.
  
  
  The Classic Trade-Off: Speed vs. Accuracy
Every AI practitioner knows the trade-off:: Quick responses are essential for user engagement, but sacrificing correctness risks misinformation, rework, and erosion of stakeholder trust.
: Deep, thoughtful analysis reduces costly errors and aligns AI insights with business objectives—but often comes at the expense of latency.With o3-pro, early adopters are reporting:Up to 30% fewer hallucinations in complex knowledge tasks
Enhanced depth of reasoning, particularly on niche domain queries
 compared to lighter models, but within acceptable thresholds for batch and analytical workloads
These metrics reinforce a critical point: enterprises should stop chasing headline speed records and start building solutions around consistent, trustworthy AI outputs.
  
  
  Building for the Enterprise: Three Pillars of Model Selection
Consistent Accuracy Over Flashy FeaturesPrioritize models that deliver dependable results in production—not just in lab settings or benchmarks.
Use A/B testing frameworks to measure real-world precision and recall on your specific datasets.Balance the cost-per-token against the value of each output. For many applications, paying a small premium for higher accuracy reduces overall cycle time and downstream error-handling costs.
Implement dynamic inference strategies: route simple queries to lightweight models, and complex analyses to o3-pro or its equivalent.Domain-Specific SolutionsTailor models with fine-tuning or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to embed institutional knowledge and guardrails.
Leverage vector databases and semantic search to ground outputs in trusted sources, reducing hallucination risks.
  
  
  Comparison: o3-pro vs. Lighter Models
Up to 30% fewer hallucinationso3-pro’s grounding reduces misinformationComplex tasks benefit from o3-pro’s reasoningSuitable for batch/analytical vs. real-timeWeigh cost against value of each outputRisk assessment, analyticsRoute queries by complexity for efficiency
  
  
  Real-World ROI: 40–60% Gains in AI Investments
Organizations adopting this reliability-first approach consistently report: on AI initiatives, due to fewer model revisions and accelerated time-to-insight
 in support and maintenance overhead, as stable models require less frequent retraining
Improved stakeholder confidence, leading to broader adoption of AI-driven processes
Case in point: A financial services firm integrated o3-pro for risk assessment workflows and saw a 50% drop in manual review rates within three months.
  
  
  When to Choose Lighter Models
Not every use case demands the depth of o3-pro. For , simple chatbots, or scaling to millions of low-stakes queries, lighter models still shine:Instant customer support bots that address common FAQs
High-volume content classification where ultra-fine nuance is less critical
Preliminary data filtering before handing off to heavier computational pipelines
The key is : let each model shine in the scenarios best suited to its strengths.
  
  
  The Bottom Line: Strategy Over Hype
As the AI landscape matures, enterprises need more than just technical implementation—they need  aligned with business outcomes. By focusing on: over performance showmanship
 across your AI stack
 through fine-tuning and RAG

Actually, it works really well, especially when you've got libraries like web3.py doing the heavy lifting.I spent way too much time at the beginning trying to figure out how to connect my Python backend to blockchain networks. Turns out, once you get past the initial setup hurdles, it's surprisingly straightforward.If you’re a Python dev curious about crypto, or working on a backend that needs to talk to a blockchain, this guide is for you.Imagine your blockchain network as a complex smart home, filled with devices like smart lights, thermostats, and security cameras. Each device understands a unique, complicated set of signals.  Controlling them manually would be chaos.Now imagine having one remote that works with everything. You press "lights on" and it figures out the exact signals to send. That's basically what web3.py does for blockchain interaction.Without it, you'd be manually crafting JSON-RPC requests (which I definitely tried at first - not fun). With it, you write normal Python code and let the library handle all that network protocol stuff behind the scenes.What Actually Is web3.py?It's a Python library that translates your regular Python commands into the JSON-RPC calls that Ethereum nodes understand. Remember those RPC requests we talked about before? This library handles all of that for you.So instead of manually constructing this:{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "eth_blockNumber", "params": [], "id": 1}With web3.py you can query data, send transactions, and interact with smart contracts, all with clean Python code.Getting Started: Installation and SetupLet's get this thing working. First, the usual Python project setup:mkdir my-web3-app
cd my-web3-app
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install web3 python-dotenv
Connecting to an Ethereum Node (Your RPC Provider)Here's where I got stuck initially. To talk to any blockchain, you need to connect to a node. These are computers running blockchain software that maintain copies of the ledger.You've got two main options:*1: Use a service like Infura or Alchemy *These companies run blockchain nodes for you. Sign up, get an API key, and you're connected to the real Ethereum network. Great for productionHow to get one: Sign up for a free account at Infura.io](https://www.infura.io/) or Alchemy.com. Create a new project for the Ethereum Mainnet or a testnet (e.g., Sepolia) and copy your HTTP endpoint URL.*2: Run your own local blockchain *When I first started, I didn’t know this was a thing. I was constantly hunting for testnet faucets and hitting request limits. Then I discovered Ganache.It spins up a personal Ethereum blockchain on your machine. Perfect for local testing, and it gives you free ETH (fake, of course).For this tutorial, we're going with Option 2 using Ganache. Trust me on this one - it'll save you so much hassle while learning.
          * Download Ganache Desktop (easiest for beginners).
          * Install it and launch. It will automatically start a local blockchain with pre-funded accounts and display its RPC server address (usually ).If you're having trouble setting it up, check this putIf you use local you can get your url here in Gananche once you've installed it.Keeping Your Secrets SafeBefore we write any code, let's set up environment variables. Create a .env file in your project folder:# .env
RPC_URL="http://127.0.0.1:7545"

# Later, when you want to use Infura:
# RPC_URL="https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
And add this to a .gitignore file so you don't accidentally commit your API keys:Now for the actual Python code. Create app.py:Run it with python app.py.

If you use Infura, you'll see a similar message.Actually Reading From the BlockchainNow comes the fun part. Let's ask the blockchain some questions:Run  again, and you'll see all this blockchain data printed to your console!You probably noticed all those w3.from_wei() calls. Here's the deal: Ethereum uses really tiny units internally to avoid floating-point math errors.1 ETH = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 wei (that's 18 zeros)1 ETH = 1,000,000,000 gwei (9 zeros)So when the blockchain returns 20000000000, that's actually 20 gwei, not 20 ETH. The conversion functions save you from doing that math yourself.What You Just AccomplishedPretty cool, right? You just:Connected Python to a blockchain networkQueried live blockchain dataHandled the weird unit conversions automaticallyDid it all with clean, readable Python codeNo manual JSON-RPC construction, no hex encoding/decoding headaches, no network protocol debugging. Just Python talking to blockchain.Next time, we're going to deploy and interact with smart contracts. That's where things get really interesting - calling functions, sending transactions, handling events.But first, play around with this code.Quick troubleshooting: If Ganache won't start, check if port 7545 is already in use.

Whether it's for a dream job, a collaboration, or just networking, crafting personalized, impactful messages can be a time sink. This challenge inspired me to build the  – an AI-powered Streamlit application designed to automate and enhance this process.In this post, I'll walk you through how this app works, its core functionalities, and the step-by-step workflow that empowers you to create compelling outreach messages in minutes.
  
  
  The Problem: Tedious & Time-Consuming Outreach
We've all been there: staring at a blank screen, trying to figure out how to introduce ourselves or pitch an idea to someone we don't know. Manually extracting relevant details from a resume, summarizing key achievements, and then weaving it all into a compelling message is a multi-step process that demands attention to detail and significant time.My goal was to create a tool that could significantly reduce this effort, allowing users to focus on the  rather than the .
  
  
  The Solution: A Seamless AI-Powered Workflow
The  automates much of this process using the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and a friendly Streamlit interface. Here’s a detailed look at the user experience and the underlying processes:
  
  
  Step 1: Secure Setup & Resume Upload 🚀
The journey begins when you launch the application. First, you'll provide your Groq API key in the dedicated sidebar section. This ensures the app has the necessary credentials to communicate with the powerful AI models. The primary input is your resume. You simply upload your resume in PDF format using the designated file uploader.Once your resume is uploaded, the application immediately gets to work behind the scenes: The system rapidly extracts all textual content from your PDF resume. Simultaneously, it scans the extracted text for any visible URLs.
  
  
  Step 2: Intelligent Link Classification & Summarization 🧠
This is where the AI and smart processing truly shine, transforming raw data into actionable insights.Hidden Link Classification: Beyond simple extraction, the app employs a specialized utility that goes through the discovered links. It intelligently classifies ambiguous or "hidden" links, ensuring that your LinkedIn, GitHub, and personal portfolio URLs are correctly identified and categorized, ready for easy inclusion in your message.AI-Powered Resume Summarization: The full text of your resume is then sent to an advanced LLM. This AI model doesn't just condense text; it analyzes your experience and skills to generate a concise, professional, and impactful summary. This summary is automatically populated into a dedicated text area on the screen, ready for your review. This feature saves you the significant effort of crafting a summary from scratch.At this point, you'll see the AI-generated summary and any automatically detected and classified links pre-filled into input fields, allowing you to easily review and make any minor adjustments or add links if they weren't detected.
  
  
  Step 3: Message Tailoring & Template Generation ✍️
With your profile data processed, you guide the AI in crafting the perfect message. You select the desired message type from a dropdown, such as "Cold Email," "LinkedIn Message," or "Other," indicating the communication channel. You input the specific job title or role you're targeting (e.g., "Software Engineer," "Data Scientist"). This critical piece of information allows the AI to tailor the message's content directly to the context of that role. With a simple click of the "Generate Template" button, the application sends all your prepared inputs – the refined resume summary, your social links, the chosen message type, and the target job type – back to the LLM.The AI then processes this comprehensive input to produce a customized message template. This template is designed for immediate use and includes dynamic placeholders, specifically  and .
  
  
  Step 4: Final Personalization & Send-Ready Message ✨
The last mile of customization is in your hands, leading to a complete, ready-to-send message. You'll see dedicated input fields where you simply type in the specific recipient's name and the company's name for your current outreach. Upon clicking "Generate Message," the application seamlessly substitutes your entered recipient and company names into the template's placeholders.The result is a fully formatted, personalized message displayed in a large text area, ready for you to copy and paste directly into your email client or LinkedIn message window. This entire process significantly reduces manual effort, allowing you to scale your outreach while maintaining a personalized touch.
  
  
  Why Groq & Streamlit? (Under the Hood Efficiency)
 The choice of Groq's API for the LLM inference is crucial. Its Language Processing Units (LPUs) provide incredible speed, making the AI summarization and message generation almost instantaneous. This eliminates frustrating wait times, providing a snappy user experience that truly saves time.Streamlit's User-Friendliness: For building interactive Python web applications, Streamlit is a fantastic choice. Its simplicity allowed me to focus primarily on the core AI logic and user workflow, rather than getting bogged down in complex web development frameworks. Leveraging libraries like LangChain helps orchestrate the LLM calls and ensures structured outputs. Pydantic schemas enforce data consistency, guaranteeing that the AI's responses are always in the expected format, leading to reliable processing at every step.I'm always thinking about how to make this tool even better: Introducing options for networking events, informational interview requests, and more diverse outreach scenarios. Allowing users to specify the desired tone (e.g., formal, friendly, direct, assertive) for their messages.ATS Keyword Optimization: Integrating functionality to analyze job descriptions and suggest relevant keywords to include in the message for Applicant Tracking System (ATS) compatibility. Exploring options for simple export functionality to popular Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tools.Ready to automate your outreach and make impactful first impressions?I'm keen to hear your feedback, suggestions, or ideas for future improvements!

Now, here is the current progress that I wanted share with you all:Modified the existing Product model to add category as Foreign key field.Applied Database migration. Added Category serializer, with a addon serializer method inside the respective serializer class to get product count for a particular category.Modified Product serializer to show category info as nesting category serializer.Created APIs to handle CRUD operation on Category.Registered both Product and Category models on Django admin interface for easy data management.Created superuser and interacted with Django Admin interface.While applying database migration, I encountered an issue as I have some data already added as Products. And no data under Category were available. Here is how I solved this(definitely with the help of prompting LLM):Deleting migration file which got created when executing  command.Commented out category field(Foreign key) in Product model. Applied migration only for creating Category model in Database.Then added data in Category model using shell command.Uncommented, category field(Foreign key) in Product model. Applied migrations again, it asked for some default value to be added in category field in existing product data. Chose the option 1. And issue sorted. I believe, there can be other ways to sort this issue.Overall, it was a great experience to till now and hoping to keep going like this.

However, after exploring many of the mainstream workflow platforms on the market, we found a common limitation: most are designed with a no-code interface. While this lowers the entry barrier, it also restricts flexibility—especially when predefined nodes can't meet specific needs. In such cases, the user experience quickly deteriorates due to the lack of extensibility.
To address these challenges, we created oomol studio, a workflow platform that strikes a balance between visual simplicity and code-level control. Our goal is to provide a tool that's not only intuitive to use but also powerful enough for complex, customizable workflows.

  🔒 Why Authentication Matters?
Think of it as creating a blog similar to Dev.to. You would prefer that no one:Articles published on your behalf 😱Get to your private drafts 📝 A  is required that: Every request is verified using this token.What is  vs What is a  and why use itHow to:

Protect routes using tokensEvery request sent via Basic Auth includes the , which are Base64-encoded (not encrypted!).  It is simple, however unless you use HTTPS, it is not secure for production.
  
  
  It's convenient, but it's unsafe, like writing your ATM PIN on the back of your debit card.

  
  
  🔐 What is OAuth2 Password Flow?
An industry-standard authorisation protocol is OAuth2.First-party apps, such as your own web or mobile app, employ a particular kind called , in which the user sends their username and password once in order to receive a .This token is sent with every request and is stored client-side.Consider the token as a  — you can roam the theatre after being validated at the gate (API).
  
  
  🧾 What is JWT (JSON Web Token)?
A  is a compact, self-contained token that contains information like:It’s  (not encrypted), so it can be verified by the server using a .
  
  
  🔐 Libraries Used for Authentication in FastAPI
Let's break down two essential libraries we use to handle authentication securely in FastAPI. is a Python implementation of the  (JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption) standard. It provides support for  handling.: Generate access tokens with user data contained.: When users get access to protected endpoints, they must read and confirm the token.: Secure tokens that use techniques like  and a secret key.Consider it the digital signature tool for the identity cards (tokens) in your app. is a comprehensive password hashing library for Python.When installed with the  extra (), it enables support for the  algorithm — one of the most secure and widely recommended password hashing methods.: Instead of storing plain text passwords, we hash them.: Compare hashed input with stored password hashes.: Used by major web frameworks and recommended for production.In real-world applications, never store plain text passwords. Use  with  to hash and verify them securely.⚠️ On some shells like Zsh, square brackets need to be quoted!pip3 install python-jose "passlib[bcrypt]"
Here's how your FastAPI authentication project is organised:authentication/

        return payload.get("sub")
    except JWTError:
        return None
This is the main application file where we define our FastAPI routes, handle user authentication, and protect endpoints using JWT tokens.from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException, status
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer, OAuth2PasswordRequestForm

Yes, you heard that right. I have no formal software engineering education, and my only past experience was a bit of HTML and PHP. But right now, I have a software project with 85% test coverage, a benchmark dashboard, and over 310 pytest test cases, featuring a custom compression engine: .So how did I achieve this?🤖 My Team: ChatGPT + GitHub CopilotBefore starting this project, I had been interested in software development for years but always stayed one step away. Everything began about a month ago when a friend showed me GitHub Copilot. "You don't have to write code," he said, "just tell it what you want to do."I took this seriously. My goal became creating a modern, open-source alternative to WinRAR. That's how Pagonic was born.My initial plans were very simple. Plain .txt files with basic headings:Step 1: Set up test infrastructure
But then my friend  showed me his planning examples. Plans with emojis, headers, graphics. That's when I realized something: Software development isn't just about code—it's also about organization, design, and strategy. Inspired by these examples, I created 12 main planning files. Each worked like a sprint, with steps, sub-headers, platform targets, and performance metrics.I first showed these plans to ChatGPT for analysis, then created my own version. Then I fed this plan to Copilot to generate code. I tested the generated code, got feedback, and reorganized. This cycle—Plan > Generate > Test > Improve—is still ongoing.
  
  
  🛠️ Development Process: Planning > Testing > CodeI ran the project not with the classic "write code first, fix later" approach, but entirely planning-centered. My plans included user scenarios, sprint days, module targets, and other details. Every day, I aimed for small but meaningful progress.
  
  
  🔬 Phase 1: Test InfrastructureI spent the first 2 weeks just writing infrastructure files like ,  and creating their tests. With files like , I increased test coverage from 12% to 85%. During this time, I established the software's testing architecture. I had to be able to test the code before understanding its behavior. This testing architecture gave me confidence. Now I was ready to move on to the compression engine.Here's an example of the registry system I built:When developing the ZIP module, I created daily sprint plans. I progressed step by step each day. I first wrote the compression engine, then included parts like entropy control, performance monitoring, and buffer management. At each step, I consulted ChatGPT and guided Copilot. But the most challenging step was "Day 5, Step 4." When ChatGPT's AI-assisted optimization strategies combined with Copilot, the  file exceeded 3000+ lines. Copilot was now reversing operations and couldn't scan the code from scratch. Finally, I completely rolled back that day, replanned, and re-implemented it in a modular way.
  
  
  😳 My Embarrassing Oversight: The Forgotten HalfHere's where I have to admit something really embarrassing that I only discovered weeks later during performance testing.: While I was obsessing over compression performance, achieving 500+ MB/s speeds and celebrating my AI-guided optimization breakthroughs, I had completely forgotten about the other half of the equation—decompression. When I finally ran end-to-end tests, I discovered my "decompression engine" was literally just one line of code:: This wasn't even using my custom ZIP parser, SIMD optimizations, or buffer pools. It was just delegating to Python's standard library. While my compression was blazing at 500+ MB/s, decompression was crawling at 2.8 MB/s.: Picture this—I'm showing my friend Ömer these amazing compression benchmarks, proudly talking about entropy analysis and AI-guided parameter tuning. Then he asks: "Cool, but how fast does it extract files?" I run the test. 2.8 MB/s.The silence was deafening.: This taught me that AI-assisted development has the same pitfall as traditional development—you can get so excited about the interesting problems that you neglect the "boring" parts. The most sophisticated compression engine in the world is useless if you forget to build the extraction engine.: Once I realized my mistake, fixing it became my biggest breakthrough...
  
  
  🚀 The ZIP Decompression Breakthrough: From Embarrassment to 90x PerformanceAfter that humiliating discovery, the decompression module became my redemption challenge. What happened next was unexpected—a performance breakthrough that transformed my biggest oversight into my proudest achievement.: My embarrassing 2.8 MB/s one-liner that wasn't even using my own code.: When I finally ran performance tests on the complete pipeline, the decompression bottleneck was glaring. While my compression engine was hitting 500+ MB/s, decompression was limping at 2.8 MB/s. This wasn't just a performance gap—it was a development oversight that needed immediate attention.: Three AI-guided optimization strategies that transformed everything—from a forgotten one-liner to industry-competitive performance:1. Hybrid Fast Path Strategy (10MB Threshold)ChatGPT analyzed my performance bottlenecks and suggested an intelligent file size strategy: Thread startup cost is ~3ms. Below 10MB, thread overhead > benefit. Above 10MB, parallel processing > overhead.2. SIMD CRC32 Hardware AccelerationZIP files require CRC32 validation for every file—a major bottleneck. ChatGPT suggested hardware acceleration:: 899% speedup on Intel/AMD CPUs with hardware CRC32 instructions.3. Memory-Aligned Buffer PoolsThe biggest surprise was memory optimization. Every decompression was allocating new buffers—extremely wasteful:: 100% buffer reuse rate, 58% memory operation speedup (2.9μs → 1.2μs).From One Line to Enterprise-Grade: The Complete Transformation: I had built an amazing compression engine but completely neglected its counterpart. This oversight taught me that AI-assisted development requires attention to the complete pipeline, not just the exciting parts.
  
  
  🎮 AI Management Tactics: How I Tame ChatGPT & CopilotWorking with AI isn't just about asking questions—it's about building a systematic workflow that maximizes AI capabilities while avoiding common pitfalls.🎯 My AI Command & Control Strategy1. The "Context Loading" Technique2. The "Incremental Complexity" RuleStart with 20-line MVP functionsTest immediately with Add complexity only after base worksNever let any single file exceed 1000 lines3. The "AI Handoff Protocol"
Step 1: Copy problem code to ChatGPT
Step 2: Get architectural advice  
Step 3: Return to Copilot with clear plan
Step 4: Implement with guided autocomplete

Not just the last piece of information, but the entire sequence of events, allowing it to understand context and predict future outcomes based on past experiences. This isn't science fiction; this is the power of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Unlike traditional neural networks that process data independently, RNNs possess a unique "memory" that allows them to analyze sequential data, making them ideal for tackling problems that involve order and context.Understanding the Core Concept: A Network with a MemoryTraditional neural networks are like static snapshots. They process a single input and produce an output, forgetting everything about the previous input. RNNs, however, are more like a video recording. They maintain an internal state, a kind of memory, that's updated with each new input. This memory allows the network to consider the sequence of inputs, understanding not just what happened but  it happened.Think of reading a sentence. Understanding "The cat sat on the mat" requires remembering "the cat" to understand where it "sat." A traditional neural network would process each word independently, failing to grasp the relationship. An RNN, however, would maintain a memory of "the cat," allowing it to correctly interpret the entire sentence.Technically, this memory is achieved through loops in the network's architecture. The output of a layer is fed back into the same layer, allowing the network to retain information from previous inputs. This loop, combined with the network's weights (which determine the importance of different inputs), enables the RNN to learn complex patterns and dependencies within sequential data.The Significance of RNNs: Tackling Sequential ChallengesThe ability to process sequential data opens up a vast array of possibilities. Many real-world problems involve sequences: time series data (stock prices, weather patterns), natural language (text, speech), and even genetic sequences. RNNs excel in these domains, offering solutions where traditional methods struggle.Applications and Transformative Impact:The impact of RNNs is already being felt across various industries:Natural Language Processing (NLP):  RNNs are revolutionizing NLP, powering applications like machine translation, text summarization, chatbots, and sentiment analysis.  They excel at understanding the nuances of language, capturing context and generating coherent text.  RNNs are crucial for converting spoken language into text, significantly improving the accuracy and efficiency of voice assistants and dictation software.  From predicting stock market trends to forecasting weather patterns, RNNs provide powerful tools for analyzing and predicting changes over time.  This has implications for finance, meteorology, and other fields.  RNNs, particularly those advanced architectures like LSTMs and GRUs, have significantly improved the quality of machine translation, enabling more natural and accurate translations between languages.  RNNs are used for analyzing medical images, predicting patient outcomes, and even assisting in drug discovery.  The ability to process sequential data like patient records allows for more personalized and effective healthcare.Challenges and Ethical Considerations:Despite their power, RNNs also present challenges:Vanishing Gradient Problem:  During training, information can be lost as it's passed through the recurrent loops, making it difficult to learn long-range dependencies.  Advanced architectures like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks were developed to mitigate this issue.  Training RNNs can be computationally expensive, requiring significant processing power and time, particularly for large datasets.  Like all machine learning models, RNNs are susceptible to biases present in the training data. This can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes, highlighting the need for careful data curation and model evaluation.  Understanding  an RNN makes a particular prediction can be challenging, limiting their transparency and accountability, especially in critical applications like healthcare and finance.A Forward-Looking Summary:Recurrent Neural Networks represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, offering powerful tools for processing sequential data and tackling complex problems across diverse fields. While challenges remain, particularly regarding computational cost and explainability, ongoing research and development are continuously refining RNN architectures and addressing these limitations. As we move forward, the transformative potential of RNNs will undoubtedly continue to reshape industries and offer innovative solutions to some of humanity's most pressing challenges. The ability to build systems that learn from sequences, remember context, and predict future outcomes based on past experiences is a cornerstone of truly intelligent systems, and RNNs are leading the way.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Is Python Good For Rapid Prototyping Applications?</title><link>https://dev.to/shriyansh_iot_98734929139/why-is-python-good-for-rapid-prototyping-applications-4e7i</link><author>Shriyansh IOT</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 01:27:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Python is an excellent language for rapid prototyping due to its simplicity, readability, and extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.

django.db.utils.IntegrityError: NOT NULL constraint failed: orders_order.total_amount

[19/Jun/2025 02:06:41] "POST /api/orders/ HTTP/1.1" 500 32475


  
  
  The Diagnosis: Where Model Tests Meet API Logic
Interestingly, my dedicated unit tests for the  and  models were passing perfectly. This confirmed that my models were correctly defined and behaved as expected in isolation.For example, for the  model, my tests covered creation, default values,  representation, updates (including  fields like  which required a small  for accurate testing!), and deletion.This led me to understand that the issue wasn't within the model itself, but rather in how the  was processing the incoming API request data before saving it to the database. The  is a calculated field (derived from order items), and my API wasn't providing an initial value.
  
  
  The Solution: Smart Serialization and Initializing Values
To resolve the  constraint violation and streamline the API's behavior, I implemented key changes in my :
  
  
  1. Making Calculated Fields Read-Only
Fields like , ,  (for initial creation), and  are typically generated or calculated by the backend, not provided by the client. Marking them as  in the serializer's  class tells DRF to ignore them during input (deserialization) but include them in the output (serialization).
  
  
  2. Ensuring Initial total_amount During Order Creation
Even after making total_amount read-only, the database still required a non-null value during the Order object's instantiation. I explicitly passed a default of 0.00 when creating the Order in the serializer's create method.# orders/serializers.py (inside OrderSerializer's create method)

import decimal # Make sure this is at the top of your file!

class OrderSerializer(...):
    # ...
    def create(self, validated_data):
        items_data = validated_data.pop('items') # Crucial: Extract nested items data

        # Initialize total_amount to 0.00 to satisfy the NOT NULL constraint.
        # This is particularly important if the model itself doesn't have a default.
        order = Order.objects.create(total_amount=decimal.Decimal('0.00'), **validated_data) 

        for item_data in items_data:
            product_instance = item_data.pop('product_id') 
            OrderItem.objects.create(
                order=order, 
                product=product_instance, 
                **item_data
            )

        # Note: I removed an explicit call to order.calculate_total_amount() here.
        # My Django signals (post_save/post_delete on OrderItem) are already configured
        # to automatically update the Order's total when its items are saved or deleted.
        # This keeps the serializer lean and relies on the model's self-maintaining logic.

        return order

  
  
  3. Handling Nested Relationships for Read/Write
For OrderItems, I used a powerful DRF pattern:For Reading (GET requests): I use product = ProductSerializer(read_only=True) to show detailed product information nested within the OrderItem.
For Writing (POST/PUT requests): I use product_id = serializers.PrimaryKeyRelatedField(queryset=Product.objects.all(), write_only=True) to expect just the product's ID from the client, simplifying the input payload.# orders/serializers.py (inside OrderItemSerializer)
# Assuming ProductSerializer is correctly imported from products.serializers
from products.serializers import ProductSerializer 

class OrderItemSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    product = ProductSerializer(read_only=True) # Full product details on read
    product_id = serializers.PrimaryKeyRelatedField( # Product ID on write
        queryset=Product.objects.all(), 
        write_only=True
    )
    # ...

  
  
  The Sweet Taste of Success!
After implementing these changes and restarting my server, the API calls from Swagger were finally successful![19/Jun/2025 02:57:30] "POST /api/orders/ HTTP/1.1" 201 378
[19/Jun/2025 02:57:59] "GET /api/orders/ HTTP/1.1" 200 742

  
  
  This journey reinforced the immense value of:
Thorough Unit Testing: Pinpointing where the issue truly lies (model vs. serializer).
Understanding DRF's Mechanics: Especially read_only_fields and custom create/update methods for nested writes.
Data Integrity: Ensuring fields meet database constraints.
Django Signals: Leveraging them for automated calculations and maintaining data consistency.

I like C# because whenever I'm writing programs in C# it's always for a Unity game. Very exiting. However, this language is by far the one on this list I know the least.

The six-figure salary. Free lunches and ergonomic chairs. The validation that you’d “made it.”So yeah, I chased it too. I did the LeetCode grind, memorized dynamic programming patterns, practiced mock interviews, followed the guides. I even reached final rounds a few times.But in 2024, I stopped. Cold.Not because I gave up. But because I .
  
  
  The FAANG Dream Is… Different Now
Here’s the thing: the tech industry in 2021 was not the tech industry in 2024.Back then, companies were throwing money at developers. Offers were wild. I saw junior devs making $180K+. Everyone was hiring. Everyone was growing. Engineers were being treated like kings.Fast forward to today, and it’s a different game.Layoffs hit hard. Not just at startups, but at , you name it.Projects were cut. Teams dissolved. Entire divisions disappeared.People who had spent  grinding for that FAANG job were shown the door in a Slack message.The myth of “job security in Big Tech” crumbled.
  
  
  I Realized I Wasn’t Chasing  Dream
At some point, I had to ask myself: Was it for the money? The brand name? The approval of other developers?I never stopped to think whether I’d actually enjoy working in a massive organization where you’re just one cog in a huge machine. Where "impact" means shipping a feature behind a feature flag that 0.02% of users might see for a week.I didn’t want to spend my days optimizing signup buttons or writing glue code between microservices I couldn’t control.
  
  
  The Interview Process Burned Me Out
Honestly? Interviewing at FAANG companies started to feel like a second job.I was coding all day… and then spending nights grinding algorithms I’d never use at work. Just to be asked some tree traversal question by someone who wouldn’t remember my name 10 minutes later.And even when I did well? Ghosted. Or given vague feedback like “we’re moving forward with someone else.”At some point, I realized I was pouring time and emotional energy into a process that didn’t even guarantee me anything in return.
  
  
  What I’m Focusing On Instead
When I stepped off the FAANG treadmill, I started seeing the ecosystem more clearly.Turns out, the world is  bigger than Silicon Valley darlings.
  
  
  Smaller Companies, Bigger Opportunities
I started working with mid-size startups and profitable bootstrapped companies. Guess what?I had way more ownership.I made product decisions.I saw my work go live in days, not quarters.I wasn’t just “Software Engineer #1283.”And I still got paid well.I also started building side projects again. Real ones. SaaS apps, tools, scripts, products I  to use.Not to pad a resume. Not to impress a recruiter. Just to , , and  again.One of them even started making money. Not a lot—but enough to remind me that there’s another path.The past few years have been a reality check for a lot of developers. Myself included.Here’s what I’ve taken away:Brand names don’t guarantee stability. Your startup job might outlast a Meta role. And it’s not always correlated with being a great developer.Ownership matters more than perks. You’ll grow faster where you have impact.Learning how to ship is more valuable than solving LeetCode Mediums.There’s no “one true path.” FAANG is not the only measure of success.I’m not saying you shouldn’t apply to FAANG.If you’re passionate about it—go for it. It’s still a great experience and a solid paycheck. But don’t do it just because the internet says it’s the holy grail.Ask yourself what kind of work you  want to do. What kind of problems you want to solve. What kind of developer you want to become.Because the truth is, no one path fits all of us.And in a world where AI is changing everything, adaptability, creativity, and autonomy might end up being your most valuable skills—not your company badge.Have you stepped off the FAANG train too? Or are you still aiming for it? Let’s talk in the comments. I’d love to hear your take.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>EuroPython: June Newsletter: Last Chance for Tickets!</title><link>https://blog.europython.eu/last-chance-for-tickets/</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 20:55:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We added a lot of new subscribers since the last newsletter – if this is your first newsletter – Welcome! 🎉Some of the tickets are sold out already 🎉We have a Python documentary premiere at EuroPythonMemorial session for Michael FoordNew sprints venue, and a completely new Social Event on an island in the heart of Prague this year!Community Organisers & PyLadies EventsSpeaker guidelines and an update on the Speaker Mentorship ProgrammeAnd a surprise at the end of the newsletter belowWe’re excited to share that tutorial and combined tickets are now ! Conference tickets are still available – but don’t wait too long. Late Bird pricing kicks in on , and ! If you can’t attend in person please check our Remote tickets – those are already available in the tickets store. Platinum, Gold and Silver Sponsorship packages are now fully booked. If you’re interested in sponsoring, please contact us at sponsoring@europython.eu. We’d love to explore options with you! We’ve also added a new startup tier – contact us for more details 🙂The filmmakers from Cult Repo, formerly known as Honeypot, are working on a documentary about the history of Python and its vibrant community. It features over 20 core developers and takes us on a journey from the first days of Python to the latest developments. At EuroPython, we’re excited to share a special preview of the film, followed by a Q&A with Brett Cannon, Paul Everitt, and Armin Ronacher. As part of EuroPython, we will be holding a memorial session to commemorate Michael Foord. Michael Foord (1974-2025) was a central figure in the Python community. He was an original thinker whose warmth, passion, and unfiltered humor touched the lives of many. A core Python developer and the creator of the influential unittest.mock module, he played a pivotal role in shaping testing practices and helped establish the Language Summit at PyCon. More than a brilliant engineer, Michael was a beloved mentor and friend, known for his elaborate vaping setup, colorful attire, and heartfelt conversations. His passing earlier this year left a profound void in the community, but his legacy lives on through his contributions to Python, his generous spirit, and the countless moments of camaraderie he inspired.Friends of Michael are invited to attend this session and share their memories. We will provide more details about it closer to the event.On Saturday 19th July, we’ll be hosting a Beginners’ Day to help introduce people to Python programming and its applications. Beginners’ Day will feature three tracks running in parallel; The Unconference, Django Girls, and Humble Data. The events are designed to welcome newcomers to the Python ecosystem, including a series of talks and panels by junior developers and two workshops designed to introduce complete beginners to web development and data science.We are running the following three tracks:, a series of panels and discussions designed to help people just getting into tech to start or grow their career, a hands-on workshop teaching the basics of web development, a hands-on workshop teaching the basics of data scienceBeginners’ Day is open to everyone, and you don’t need a EuroPython ticket to attend (although note that some tracks will cost €5 to attend otherwise). From students to those exploring a career change, we warmly invite anyone curious about starting their programming journey. Expect a friendly, fun, and supportive environment that will leave you feeling more confident and inspired to continue learning.Please see this page for more details and to apply. Places are limited and will be given on a first come, first serve basis.Join us for EuroPython&aposs traditional Sprint Weekend on Saturday and Sunday (19–20 July) following the main conference. The conference team provides space, lunch, and coffee—you bring the projects, energy, and ideas. Whether you’re a seasoned maintainer or trying your first contribution, sprints are informal hackathons to collaborate on open‑source, share knowledge, and solve problems together. We’ll host a laid‑back social evening on Thursday, 17 July at 19:30 CEST on Střelecký Island—right in the heart of Prague. Expect riverside seating, live music and jam sessions (feel free to bring an instrument), plus board games and plenty of relaxation spots. There&aposs also a mix of outdoor sports (volleyball, croquet, pétanque) and light snacks and drinks for a summery, informal vibe. A limited number of social-event tickets will be available separately—keep an eye out so you don’t miss out. The Python community is an essential part of the language, and for many people, it’s the reason they stick around and keep meetups, conferences, forums, and so much more running to help others.We have several activities focused on communities across Europe and around the world, as well as initiatives centered around Python itself.We’re excited to announce a range of events for underrepresented groups in computing this year! 🎉 Whether you’re new to PyLadies or a long-time supporter, we warmly welcome you to join us and be part of our supportive community.These events are open only to those who have a conference ticket, giving our participants an opportunity to connect, share, and grow together.Have you ever wondered what people snack on in Spain?

  quick answers for the desperate
Q: How can I detect when my LangChain RAG pipeline hallucinates technical terminology?
pattern matching for danger words works. if your bot explains "python" with "snake" or "kafka" with "author", you've got terminology hallucination. takes ~80ms to check.Q: What's the most effective way to prevent domain terminology confusion in production RAG systems?
inject correct definitions before the llm sees anything. pre-populate context with your glossary. stopped 95% of our terminology disasters.Q: Should I use pre-filtering or post-processing for terminology validation?
both. pre-filter removes obviously wrong contexts (python + reptile docs). post-process catches creative interpretations. belt and suspenders.Q: How do I handle ambiguous technical terms in my RAG pipeline?
force disambiguation in your prompts. explicitly state "Python (programming language, NOT the snake)". sounds dumb, works great.
  
  
  the morning logs of shame
checked slack. it got worse:user: "explain our circuit breaker pattern"
bot: "circuit breakers are electrical safety devices that stop current flow..."

user: "what's kafka in our stack?"
bot: "kafka, named after franz kafka, handles messages with existential reliability..."
we use hystrix, not electrical circuits. and that kafka explanation? our cto called it "poetic but useless."
  
  
  why yesterday's fix missed this
my pattern detection caught lies about features. but terminology? different beast:llms know multiple meanings (python = snake AND language)retrieval gets partial matchesbot fills gaps with general knowledge
  
  
  definition injection that actually works

  
  
  the prompt that saved my job

Tools like Doodle make scheduling easier — but I wanted to create something simpler, open-source, and custom-built with a modern stack. That’s how  was born.EventStack is a lightweight event scheduling app that allows users to propose time slots, vote on availability, and finalize meetings — all with a slick frontend and real-time updates.I wanted to explore , a powerful Python framework known for handling asynchronous and real-time web apps. Unlike Flask or Django, Tornado gives fine-grained control over sockets, routing, and performance. I also wanted to integrate: for easy login as a robust backendA beautiful frontend using Potential for WebSocket-based real-time votingThis project was a perfect way to combine learning with utility.: Tornado – asynchronous Python framework: Tailwind CSS + custom HTML templates: GitHub OAuth2 (manual token exchange using ): PostgreSQL (used NeonDB Postgres during initial dev, later moved to local): Runs locally and deployable to platforms like Railway, etc.
  
  
  Authentication with GitHub
OAuth integration was handled manually — bypassing libraries like Authlib — to better understand the token exchange process. Users log in via GitHub, and their profile data is stored securely in the database.✅ Create events with multiple time slots✅ Vote for available slots✅ Real-time voting updates✅ Auto-finalization and notifications (planned)A clean dashboard for users to view and manage eventsInteractive voting interfaceMarkdown-ready comment section (coming)All templates are rendered server-side with Jinja2 and styled using Tailwind for responsiveness and polish.Tornado requires more boilerplate than Flask, but it pays off for async control.GitHub OAuth is surprisingly easy when broken down.NeonDB's PostgreSQL is handy for prototyping — but local or cloud-managed Postgres is better for production.Real-time updates will require integrating tornado.websocket.WebSocketHandler.Email or GitHub notifications on finalizationEventStack is more than just a clone — it’s a showcase of how you can build something powerful, fast, and modern with minimal libraries. If you’re looking to build real-time apps in Python, give Tornado a try.Want to contribute? The GitHub repo will be public soon.

Still feels like I’m “new” because every time I think I’ve figured it out, Python throws me a new curveball.In the beginning, it was just print statements and if-else ladders. Then came list comprehensions, then lambda, and then… well, I started breaking things just to understand how they work.Somewhere between debugging spaghetti functions and reading other people’s cleaner code, I stumbled onto a few features that felt advanced but also cool. Not scary textbook stuff, but practical tools that instantly made my code feel smarter.So I made a list.These are the 7 features that made me go, “Wait, Python can do THAT?”€50 free credits for 30 days trial Promo code: If you’re also somewhere between “I kinda get it” and “please don’t make me touch metaclasses,” this list is for you.When I first saw , I thought it was a typo. Looked like someone fell asleep on the keyboard.And my brain short-circuited.Both work the same but the walrus version? Cleaner. Less cognitive load. It feels like a pro move.The walrus operator (introduced in Python 3.8) allows you to assign and return a value in a single expression. Think of it like a shortcut that lets you reuse a value without writing an extra line.I was filtering a massive list of objects and needed to both check if a value existed and use it without calling the function twice.Before, I would’ve written:Both are valid. But one of them makes you feel like you finally speak Python like a native.There’s a certain pain that comes with writing class constructors in Python when you’re doing it the old-school way:Every beginner tutorial shows you this. And it works… until you have 6 fields. Then it gets annoying. You write  a hundred times and start wondering if you're doing something wrong.That’s it. No constructor. No , , or other magic methods. Python just gives them to you.I was working on a side project with a bunch of models, and my classes were getting out of hand. I needed clean, readable code that wasn’t buried in boilerplate.Using  instantly made everything more elegant. I could even set default values or make fields optional with just a few extra keystrokes.It’s like Python saying: “Hey, I got you. Stop writing stuff I can handle.”Want your objects to be immutable (like a tuple)? Just add:Now trying to change  will raise an error. This saved me from dumb bugs more than once.I used to write stuff like this all the time:Not because I loved it because I didn’t know any better.Then someone commented on my GitHub code:“You know you can just use , right?”And boom. My brain rebooted. you’re declaring exactly what you’re using: an index and an item. no  surprises if you refactor the list. no unnecessary  wrapper or manual indexing.I was building a CLI tool that processed user input line-by-line. I needed the line number and the content.  made the loop stupidly clean:That ? Chef’s kiss.At first,  felt like Python’s way of trolling me.That’s not returning a list. It’s returning… something that feels like a ghost list.When a function uses , it becomes a . It doesn’t return all the values at once it  on each call.You’re working with huge datasetsYou want You need lazy evaluation (like streaming log files or paginated APIs)I had a CSV file with ~10 million rows (don’t ask). Loading the whole thing into memory crashed my script faster than a triple nested loop.So I rewrote the loader with :Now I could iterate row by row without a memory meltdown.bonus: generators are resumableEvery time  runs, it “saves” the state of the function and picks up from there next time. It's like your function hits a  instead of exiting.Photo by Shahadat Rahman on UnsplashThis one was like discovering a hidden input slot in Python’s controller.“Cool cool… but what black magic is this and why are there asterisks?”Turns out, it’s one of the most  ways to make your functions flexible, reusable, and clean.: collects extra positional arguments into a tuple: collects  into a dictionaryThis means your function can accept as many inputs as someone throws at it and sort them out like a boss.I was writing a wrapper function around a third-party library. The underlying method took a  of arguments, and I didn’t want to replicate them manually.No more worrying about which exact parameters to expect. It just… worked.Bonus: you can also unpack themYou can use  and  not only to  arguments, but also to  them:It feels like Python saying: “Here’s a shortcut. Don’t make it weird.”Ever written a recursive function that technically works but practically melts your CPU?Let me introduce you to the decorator that made me feel like a performance wizard:I first tried it on a basic Fibonacci function:No fancy tricks. Just a simple line of magic: .Before: took forever to get to  After: instant result (Least Recently Used cache)  of previous calls. So if the same input shows up again, Python just returns the cached answer no need to recompute.Functions with repeatable input/outputI was calculating some deeply nested config dependencies in a tree structure. Re-running the same function on the same node again and again slowed everything to a crawl.Boom. Problem solved. Like a function with memory but without you needing to manage a cache dictionary manually.It only works with  (same input = same output)All arguments must be  (so no lists or dicts directly) is like a brain for your function: it remembers what it’s done and doesn’t repeat itself. If only people worked that way.Like most folks, I first saw  used like this:So naturally, I thought it was just a shortcut for opening and closing files.Wait. WHAT?! You can use  on ?Yes. Anything that has  and  under the hood can be used in a  block.That’s when I discovered: context managers are low-key Python gold.A context manager is just a way to set something up, do some work, and clean up afterward safely.Cleanup runs after even if there’s an errorThink: safe transactions, locks, temp files, database sessions, timing blocks…You can even write your ownHere’s a simple custom context manager that times how long a block of code takes:Boom. Clean, reusable, and no stray  blocks.Bonus:  makes it even easierYou can skip the whole class and use a generator-style context manager:Once you realize  is just a fancy lifecycle manager, you start seeing uses for it .Look, I’m not a Python pro. I still Google basic stuff like how to reverse a list or the difference between  and  (don’t judge me). But every time I learn a feature like the ones above, Python feels more like a language and less like a puzzle.The best part? These aren’t obscure, academic features. They’re . You can start using them  and feel the difference in how clean, fast, and flexible your code becomes.So if you’re somewhere around year 1 or 2 of your Python journey, I hope these gave you some “aha” moments. And if you’re already past that point? Hey drop your favorite underrated Python feature in the comments. I’m still learning.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Build &amp; Deploy Apps in Under 10 Minutes with Neuronum - A Getting Started</title><link>https://dev.to/yannisscherer/build-deploy-apps-in-under-10-minutes-with-neuronum-a-getting-started-26o7</link><author>Yannis</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 19:15:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Neuronum is a framework to build serverless connected app & data gateways automating the processing and distribution of data transmission, storage, and streaming.Cell: Account to connect and interact with NeuronumNodes: Soft- and Hardware components hosting gatewaysTransmitters (TX): Securely transmit and receive data packagesCircuits (CTX): Store data in cloud-based key-value-label databasesStreams (STX): Stream, synchronize, and control data in real timepip neuronum          neuronum create-cell          neuronum connect-cell         neuronum view-cell            Initialize Node (default template):neuronum init-node            neuronum start-node           neuronum stop-node            Connect Node to Neuronum:neuronum connect-node         ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>My First Week with Python: A Summer of Curiosity and Code</title><link>https://dev.to/misspresidentcodes/my-first-week-with-python-a-summer-of-curiosity-and-code-2kap</link><author>Khyati Sahu</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 19:05:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello, world!
I’m a first-year engineering student from Madhav Institute of Technology & Science (Deemed University), currently on my summer break, and I’ve decided to spend this time not just relaxing — but learning. Growing. And most importantly, building a solid foundation in coding.
This is the story of my first week learning Python, and if you're someone who's just starting out, or someone who loves seeing others learn, I hope this post finds you with a spark of joy.🐍 
Python felt like the perfect companion for this journey — simple to read, powerful under the hood, and used across so many fields: web development, automation, AI, data science, you name it!
But I didn’t want to just read about Python. I wanted to understand it, to try things, to break things, and fix them again. And so, I dove in.💫 Reflections From a Beginner’s Heart
I’m not perfect. I’ve written buggy code. I’ve stared at error messages like they were ancient riddles. But in every moment of frustration, there’s also this tiny flicker that says —“Hey, you’re learning. This is how growth looks.”
I may be at the start of this journey, but I am walking with wonder. And even when the road feels steep, I remind myself that every coder was once a confused beginner — just like me.🔹** What I’ve Learned in Week 1**
Here’s what my mind is full of right now:
🌸 Basics of Python Syntax
The way Python talks is… soft-spoken and neat. No messy semicolons, no curly brackets. Just logic and indentation — like poetry for machines.🌸 Variables and Data Types
From strings to integers, floats to booleans — I learned how to store and juggle different kinds of data. And yes, Python makes it very beginner-friendly.🌸 Input/Output Functions
Using input() and print() gave me a sense of interaction — like the code wasn’t just doing things for me, but with me.🌸 Python 2 vs Python 3
This was so eye-opening! I learned key differences like:
print being a statement in Python 2, but a function in Python 3 and much more.
(P.S. Python 3 is the future and the now!)🌸 Pattern Printing
This was my first taste of real logic-building. Those triangle stars!
They look innocent — but they're sneaky logic puzzles in disguise. I loved trying different loops and seeing shapes appear.✨** Let’s Grow Together**
If you’re also on a coding journey — whether you’re at Day 1 or Year 5 — I’d love to hear from you. Share your favorite resources, tips, or just say hi in the comments! Let’s cheer each other on.
Thanks for reading my little update. Until next time, keep coding, keep blooming. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Untitled</title><link>https://dev.to/ozen_temeozen_e88de16e9a/untitled-228p</link><author>Ozen Teme Ozen</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 18:22:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out this Pen I made!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🤖 From Using Bots to Building One</title><link>https://dev.to/panicatthekernel/from-using-bots-to-building-one-2775</link><author>PanicAtTheKernel</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 17:54:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the last post, I talked about this cool bot I  — a Telegram bot that handed out disposable emails and pinged you when you got mail. Super handy. But using that tool sparked something deeper:"Why not build my own bot?"
  
  
  ⚙️ What I Wanted To Build
I wanted a bot that wasn’t just a gimmick — something that:🤝 Responds to commands like , , and 🧠 Remembers user sessions and states📨 Lets users send a fake email  to an actual inbox🚀 Maybe, just maybe, automate future workflows with buttons, menus, and repliesBasically, I wanted it to feel less like a bot and more like a . Railway (yes, I’m cheap and lazy) Integrated with SMTP for outbound fake emails Markdown formatting, async functions, and custom keyboards for replies
  
  
  🛠️ The Build Process (With Dumb Mistakes I Made)

  
  
  Step 1: Setting Up the Bot Token 🔑
Grabbed the token from @botfather (yes, still feels like talking to mafia). Put it in a  file — lesson learned from hardcoding it once and almost pushing to GitHub. 😅
  
  
  Step 2: Basic Command Handling 🚦
Wired up , , and . Pretty straightforward.
  
  
  Step 3: Sending Emails via Telegram 📤
Hooked up the backend with SMTP. Had the user enter subject ➝ recipient ➝ body — in that order.Also added some basic validation because people type like goblins.Instead of plain text, I used Telegram inline buttons. So now, it’s tap-and-go instead of sending a wall of text.How to use inline queries and callback handlersThat bot UX is way harder than expectedSending emails from bots is easy, validating human input is notHosting bots that don't go offline is a full-time jobAdd a dashboard for viewing sent emailsSchedule emails using cronIntegrate with GPT for auto-generating email replies 🤯Maybe… maybe even turn it into a public utility?I used a Telegram bot.
I liked it.
It sends fake emails and talks like me.Moral of the story? Curiosity + caffeine = shipping cool shit.Built with 💻, ☕, and a hint of "I wonder if this breaks..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>YouTube channel mirror on Jekyll - part 2</title><link>https://dev.to/solvecomputerscience/youtube-channel-mirror-on-jekyll-part-2-g0f</link><author>Solve Computer Science</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 17:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Continuing the previous post we'll now transform the shell script into a Python one.

The chat template applied in the above result uses the  in  by default, unless a separate  option is specified.Chat template testing can be performed as follows:
  
  
  Request/Response Schema of Now that I understand the fundamental differences between the endpoints, let me examine the detailed structure of the  request and response schemas.
Understanding these schemas is crucial for effective API integration and troubleshooting, as they define the contract between client applications and vLLM's serving infrastructure.My analysis here is based on vLLM's source code implementation, providing insights into both OpenAI-compatible fields and vLLM-specific extensions that enhance functionality beyond the standard API specification.The  class in vLLM implements the complete OpenAI Chat Completions API specification while adding several vLLM-specific extensions for advanced sampling and optimization features.The schema is carefully organized to match the official OpenAI API documentation order, ensuring maximum compatibility with existing OpenAI client libraries and tools.list[ChatCompletionMessageParam]Array of conversation messagesFrequency-based token penalty (-2.0 ~ 2.0)Optional[dict[str, float]]Bias for specific tokens' logitsWhether to return log probabilitiesNumber of top log probabilities to return (0-20)Maximum number of tokens to generateNumber of completions to generatePresence-based token penalty (-2.0 ~ 2.0)Optional[AnyResponseFormat]Response format specification (JSON mode)Seed for reproducible outputOptional[Union[str, list[str]]]Stop strings for generationWhether to stream responsesSampling temperature (0.0 ~ 2.0)Nucleus sampling probabilityOptional[list[ChatCompletionToolsParam]]Function call tool definitionsOptional[Union[Literal, NamedToolChoice]]Number of generations to select best fromWhether to use beam searchConsider only top k tokensMinimum probability thresholdMinimum number of tokens to generateWhether to skip special tokens in outputspaces_between_special_tokensWhether to add spaces between special tokensTruncate prompt to specified token countNumber of prompt log probabilities to returnThe message object structure supports both simple text conversations and complex multimodal interactions. vLLM extends the standard OpenAI message format to support custom roles and enhanced tool integration.Message role: , , , Union[str, list[ChatCompletionContentPartParam]]Message content (text or multimodal array)Tool call ID (required when role is )Optional[Iterable[ChatCompletionMessageToolCallParam]]The response schema follows the OpenAI specification closely while incorporating vLLM-specific enhancements for advanced use cases like KV caching optimization and detailed logging.Unique identifier for the completion requestLiteral["chat.completion"]Object type ( or )Creation time represented as Unix timestamplist[ChatCompletionResponseChoice]Array of generated completion choicesOptional[list[Optional[dict[int, Logprob]]]]Prompt log probability informationEach choice represents a single completion generated by the model.

When a user sends a  request to , FastAPI's routing system directs the request to the following function, which serves as the main entry point for chat completion requests.I can see that the  is defined through the  function.
This function retrieves the  instance that was registered in the  during server initialization, as shown below.The  object is a class included in the Starlette framework, and it inherits the  property from its parent class .
This design provides access to the application state and configuration throughout the request lifecycle.The  property provides access to the FastAPI application instance, while  contains ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) information about the current request.
This architecture follows the ASGI specification, enabling efficient handling of asynchronous web requests.
  
  
  Application State Initialization
Looking at the initialization of state.openai_serving_chat, it occurs in the  function as follows.
This initialization happens during server startup, ensuring that all necessary components are ready before handling incoming requests.The  mechanism can be tested with the following example.
This demonstrates how FastAPI's application state works in practice and how components are shared across request handlers.curl  | jq
: 0,
  : 0.7867811845314955
Examining the server logs reveals the initialization sequence: the  instance is initialized before FastAPI starts running.
When a request arrives, the  is retrieved from request.app.state.openai_serving_chat and executed.This pattern demonstrates FastAPI's application lifecycle management, where:: Critical components are set up during server startup: Pre-initialized components are accessed through the application state: The actual request handling occurs with the retrieved handler

As I observed in the router's  function above, all preprocessing, LLM inference, and postprocessing for  requests are performed within the following method.How does the complete processing flow work?
Let's examine the step-by-step process:: When the request's  is , it undergoes validation and generates . \
                     Now that I've examined the overall chat completion processing pipeline, let me dive into the important core logic components.For this analysis, I'll assume that beam search is not being used and examine the code accordingly.Content Format and Conversation Setup: Prepares  (determines the content format for chat templates based on tools and model configuration),  (parsed conversation messages with multimodal data handling), and  (future object for asynchronous multimodal data processing), then updates the  (user-specified chat template settings) into  (internal chat template configuration dictionary).Process tool parsing if enabled: When a tool parser is configured and the tool choice is not , the system determines whether tool parsing should be performed. If tools are being used, the request is adjusted through the tool parser to handle function calling capabilities. This step ensures that the model can correctly interpret and respond to tool-related requests.Tokenize the request prompt: Convert the string-based prompt into token format for model processing. For string prompts, the system uses asynchronous tokenization with optional prompt truncation and special token handling through the OpenAIServing._tokenize_prompt_input_async() method, which performs tokenization in a thread pool to prevent blocking the main event loop. For , token IDs are already provided, so the system creates a  object containing both the decoded text and the token IDs.: Construct the final  object that will be passed to the inference engine. This includes the tokenized prompt, multimodal data (if present), multimodal processor kwargs, and cache salt for caching optimization. The function returns the processed conversation, request prompt, and engine prompt for the next stage of processing.Inference is performed through the OpenAIServingChat(OpenAIServing).engine_client.generate() method.
In this document, I'm using  as the , so let me examine the AsyncLLM(EngineClient).generate() method.Initialize output handler: AsyncLLM(EngineClient).output_handler is executed by running the AsyncLLM(EngineClient)._run_output_handler() method.The  executes in the following order:

Pull  from the : Continuously polls the engine core for outputs using await engine_core.get_output_async() and processes them in chunks to avoid blocking the event loop.: Each output chunk is processed through output_processor.process_outputs() which converts raw engine outputs into formatted request outputs and pushes them to appropriate async streams.: Processes any requests that need to be aborted due to stop strings or other completion conditions via await engine_core.abort_requests_async().: Records scheduler statistics and iteration metrics for monitoring and debugging purposes.: The inference request is sent to the core engine through the AsyncLLM(EngineClient).add_request() method.AsyncLLM(EngineClient).add_request() operates as follows:

Process input and create request: Converts the input prompt and parameters into an internal request object using self.processor.process_inputs(), which handles tokenization, parameter validation, and request formatting.Send request to core engine: The AsyncLLM(EngineClient)._add_request() method calls the AsyncMPClient(MPClient).add_request_async() method to send an EngineCoreRequestType.ADD request to the core engine, enabling asynchronous communication between the client and the engine process for efficient request queuing and processing. \
            Process request through busy loop: The request sent in this way is processed through  via a busy loop as shown below and scheduled in the EngineCoreProc(EngineCore).scheduler.: The scheduler determines which requests to process next based on factors like priority, available resources, sequence length, and batching constraints. It creates batched sequences for efficient GPU utilization and manages the transition of requests between different states (waiting, running, swapped).Execute model with scheduler output: The EngineCoreProc(EngineCore).model_executor.execute_model() method is executed using the  (which contains batched sequences, execution metadata, and resource allocation information) from the Scheduler(SchedulerInterface).schedule() method output.Send model inference request: The model inference request is sent through the UniProcExecutor(UniProcExecutorV0, Executor).collective_rpc() method. \
            Add results to output queue: The results are added to the EngineCoreProc(EngineCore).output_queue.Yield outputs until completion: The queue () yields outputs until the inference is .The process of preparing the response that users will receive is very complex, so the code for this section has been excluded.Method Initialization

But I  curious what Amazon Q CLI could do. And yeah, the swag sounded fun.So I gave myself a quick challenge:🧠 Let Q CLI do most of the work🎮 End up with something that runs
  
  
  🧪 My Iteration Journey (with Prompts I gave Q)

  
  
  🎮 Getting the First Build Running
“Build an endless jumper game in Python using pygame.”Q spun up a basic prototype:It worked! But sometimes… you just drop off the screen instantly. RIP.“Fix a bug where the player sometimes falls immediately when the game starts.”But there was another issue: once you lost, the game window just closed. No warning, no time to react.
  
  
  💀 Game Over Screen + Reset
“When the player loses, show a ‘Game Over’ screen and wait for a key press before closing. Also, add a reset feature, pressing ‘R’ should restart the game.”Super helpful for testing. No more relaunching the app every time I mess up.But there was something weird, the platforms were too wide. You literally couldn’t lose. You just bounced forever.
  
  
  📏 Fixing the “Can’t Lose” Bug + Adding Difficulty
“Fix the bug where when you jump further up, the platform becomes too big — like make some difficulty in the game.”With this prompt, Q made the game more challenging: : You could finally miss a jump and fall : Platforms spread apartNow we’re talking. It finally felt like a game — one you could actually lose.“Add a random power-up — you decide what it is — and spawn it on some platforms. Enhance the game.”Q gave me power-ups like:Cool stuff — but a new bug appeared: timer kept ticking even after you lost.“Fix the timer — once the game ends or is frozen, the timer should stop.”Clean fix. Timer now pauses properly during freezes and stops on game over. That wrapped it up nicely.“Create a README.md for the project.”Q generated a clean, well-written README file with usage instructions.This was a fun, focused experiment. In under 2 hours, I went from nothing to:A playable endless jumper gameScaling difficulty and proper fail conditionsA working power-up systemReset and game-over mechanicsNo, I haven’t claimed the T-shirt yet.

You're hours into a problem, you've run through all your checklists, and you hit a wall. You lean back and have that all-too-familiar thought: For the past few months, I've been building a project called RAWPA (Rodney the Advanced Web Pentesting Assistant) to be the answer to that exact question. But before I show you what it is, I need to tell you what it .I need to state this with utmost importance: RAWPA is not a "get bugs quick scheme."I strongly encourage the manual process of scouring through JS files, searching for business logic errors, finding exposed endpoints, and getting creative in Burp Suite. RAWPA is not an automation script to replace those skills. It's a companion to provide more ideas when your own list runs out.
  
  
  The Shiny AI Feature (And Why I Benched It)
Naturally, I wanted to build a slick, AI-powered assistant. I dove in headfirst, building a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model to act as a "Copilot" for each testing step. The initial results were amazing! The AI was parsing commands and providing genuinely helpful guidance. It felt like magic. ✨But as I tried to make it more precise, the magic started to fade. The responses got noisy, the code started breaking, and I realized I was spending all my time debugging the AI instead of building the core of the app.So I made a tough call: I put the entire feature on hold.I built an admin panel for the project (a huge win in itself!) and added a simple toggle to turn the AI off. It felt like benching my star player, but it was the right strategic move. Perfecting that AI is a whole project on its own, and the core methodologies had to come first.
  
  
  So, What Am I Doing Now? The Grind.
Right now, I'm in the deep-dive research phase. This is the less glamorous part of development that doesn't always make it into blog posts. I'm spending my days (and nights) scouring the web, watching technical talks, and digging through research papers to find, test, and validate every single methodology that goes into RAWPA.This process was validated when I stumbled upon lostsec's site, which has a similar purpose. Instead of feeling discouraged, it gave me the will to continue, proving there's a real need for tools that augment, rather than automate, our thinking.This project also thrives on community knowledge. A connection from LinkedIn gave me a fantastic list of future feature ideas, like gamification, tool integrations, and collaborative modes, which have really shaped the long-term vision.
  
  
  What's Next & How You Can Help
My goal is to make RAWPA a reliable, community-informed resource.This is a community-driven effort. If you have methodologies, ideas, or suggestions, I would love to hear them. The best way to reach out is on 
At the end of the day, I believe RAWPA will help someone get unstuck and learn something new. And for me, that's good enough.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Most Advanced Open-Source AI Assistant</title><link>https://dev.to/randomperson131213/most-advanced-open-source-ai-assistant-157m</link><author>Syed Aayan Ahmed</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 14:51:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[🧠 Great SAGE — An Offline AI Assistant I Built During My Exam Break (Now Open-Source)Hi everyone — I’m Aayan, and I want to tell you about a project I’ve poured weeks of work into: a fully offline, desktop-based AI assistant I built from scratch during my exam break.It's called Great SAGE — short for Smart AI Guided Entity. It works locally on Windows, has its own GUI with an avatar, understands voice commands via a wake-word, and even runs a full large language model (LLM) offline to handle AI tasks.And now... it’s open-source. The project is up and running, but I need help with polishing, debugging, and expanding it. If you're a Python dev, AI enthusiast, or just someone curious about real offline AI automation — this is for you.What is Great SAGE?
Great SAGE is a full-featured AI assistant designed to run completely offline on your PC. It doesn’t send anything to the cloud, doesn’t rely on APIs, and doesn’t need internet access to function.Detects a wake word (“Hey SAGE”) using local wake-word detectionUnderstands voice input with offline speech recognition (Vosk)Processes AI queries using a local LLM (MythoMax 13B, via llama.cpp or ollama)Responds via TTS and GUI outputControls apps and files with your voice — open programs, move/delete files, organize foldersSets reminders and fetches daily info like weather or newsSupports image generation from voice prompts using Stable DiffusionIncludes Android sync features via KDE Connect and ScrcpyHas a login system secured with password + facial recognitionComes with a GUI and animated assistant avatar built in TkinterIt’s a real, functioning system — not a concept, not a mockup, not a UI template.Why I Built It
To be honest, I built it to challenge myself. I wanted to prove that a full AI assistant could be done without the cloud. No Google APIs, no OpenAI keys, no server dependencies.Just Python, local models, open-source tools, and a lot of trial-and-error.I also wanted something that felt personal — not a generic bot. So I added the avatar. The GUI. The wake word. The local AI engine.I’m proud of what I managed to build alone — but I know it could be so much better with help.What It Needs Now
The core of Great SAGE is solid — but it's rough around the edges. Some parts of the voice pipeline need syncing. The GUI and backend integration could be cleaner. There are some bugs. Optimization is needed for smoother performance, especially when multiple subsystems run at once.That’s why I’m opening it up.Looking for Contributors
Whether you’re a Python dev, GUI designer, AI tinkerer, or just someone who loves improving open-source software — I’d love to have your help.Fixes for voice input/output bugs and integration issuesGUI improvements (Tkinter enhancements, avatar effects, layout tweaks)Async cleanup and smarter subprocess handlingBetter error handling across the appGeneral performance optimizationTesting on different Windows systems (it currently runs on Quadro M5000M + i7-6820HQ + 32GB RAM)If you enjoy working with speech recognition, local LLMs, Tkinter, automation, or system control via Python — this is a goldmine.Download and Try It

The aim isn’t to launch the next blockbuster transcription service—it’s to give myself a dependable way to capture ideas on the go in a structured format. For the last couple of years I’ve relied on its predecessor, voice-cli, which proved how powerful that workflow can be. SpeechDown is the natural successor and, yes, a playground for practicing software-craft principles and experimenting with AI-driven development.This post is a brief tour of that journey so far.First things first: I don't recommend using SpeechDown for any critical work . It's a work in progress. However, I believe the code and the development practices behind it can serve as a useful, real-world example for the concepts I'm about to discuss.Capture and organise my own voice notes in a searchable Markdown corpus
Personal sandbox to practise software-craft principles
Test-bed for AI-assisted coding workflows
Architecture in a nutshellDomain-Driven Design (DDD) keeps core logic pure and language-aligned
Ports & Adapters (Hexagonal) pattern isolates I/O, letting adapters swap freely
Four layers: , , , Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture the “why” of each big choice
Design / PRD docs outline features up front for both humans  AIs
Design docs serve as rich prompts for Copilot, Codex, Claude Code, etc.
A single  file synchronizes naming, layout, and testing rules across tools
sd transcribe --within-hours 24 turns recent audio into timestamped Markdown
Adding a new speech-to-text engine is as simple as implementing another adapter
Pre-v1 playground: solid for learning and tinkering, not yet production-gradeSee the  section at the end for a curated set of recent deep-dive posts and tools that extend these ideas.
  
  
  Part 1: A Playground for Software Craftsmanship
One of my main goals with SpeechDown was to apply and practice established software design patterns in a Python context.
  
  
  Domain-Driven Design (DDD) & Ports and Adapters Pattern
I structured the project using a layered architecture inspired by DDD and the Ports and Adapters (or Hexagonal) pattern. This helps keep the core logic of the application separate from the tools and technologies it uses.The project is split into four distinct layers:: Contains the core business logic, entities, and value objects. It has zero external dependencies.: Orchestrates the use cases. It defines interfaces (Ports) for external interactions.: Provides concrete implementations (Adapters) for the ports. This is where database connections, file system access, and API calls live.: The user-facing layer, in this case, the Command-Line Interface (CLI).This structure is reflected in the source code directory:src/speechdown/
├── application/
│   ├── ports/
│   └── services/
├── domain/
│   ├── entities.py
│   └── value_objects.py
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── adapters/
│   └── database.py
└── presentation/
    └── cli/
A  is just an interface. For example, to get a timestamp from a file, the application layer defines a simple contract:The  is the concrete implementation. This one parses filenames or falls back to the file's modification time:This separation makes the system incredibly flexible and testable. I can easily swap out the  for one that reads metadata from the audio file without changing any of the application's core logic.
  
  
  Documenting Decisions with ADRs and Design Docs
To keep track of  certain decisions were made, I use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). They are simple Markdown files that document a decision, its context, and its consequences. You can see them in .For more detailed feature planning, I use , which outline the —covering product requirements, UX, and technical design. This practice is especially useful when working with AI assistants.
  
  
  Part 2: A Playground for AI Collaboration
The second major goal of SpeechDown is to explore how to work effectively with modern AI coding assistants. Simply asking an AI to "add a feature" often results in code that breaks the established architecture.My solution involves two key practices:
  
  
  1. Design Documents (PRDs) as AI Prompts
I write detailed design documents before starting a feature. These documents serve as a comprehensive prompt for the AI, giving it the necessary context to generate code that fits the project's structure. I'm considering renaming my  folder to  (Product Requirement Documents), as this seems to be emerging as a standard term for this practice.
  
  
  2. Explicit Rules for AI Assistants
I maintain a master rule file, , that explicitly defines the project's architecture, naming conventions, and testing requirements. Follow Domain-Driven Design with four layers: , , , .
 Domain layer () contains entities and value objects only. No external dependencies.
 Application layer () defines ports (interfaces) under ...
 Dependencies point inward...

 Interfaces end with  (e.g., ).
 Implementations end with  (e.g., ).
 Service classes end with .
A simple Python script (scripts/generate_ai_rules.py) then generates specific configuration files for different AI assistants from this master file:.github/copilot-instructions.md for GitHub Copilot for OpenAI Codex for Anthropic's ClaudeThis ensures that no matter which tool I'm using—GitHub Copilot, Google's Jules, or Claude Code—it has the same set of instructions. This has dramatically improved the quality and compliance of AI-generated code.Despite being a playground, SpeechDown is a usable CLI tool. After initializing a project with , you can run a transcription with a simple command:
sd transcribe  24
This processes the audio files and groups the transcriptions into daily Markdown files, like :

This powerful synergy is giving rise to Web3 AI Agents – autonomous, intelligent entities that can perceive, reason, plan, and act within decentralized ecosystems, promising a new frontier in digital interaction, automation, and value creation.Gone are the days when AI was confined to centralized servers, opaque algorithms, and corporate control. Web3 AI Agents embody a future where intelligence is distributed, transparent, and user-centric, fundamentally altering how we interact with the internet and manage digital assets. This blog delves into what Web3 AI Agents are, their transformative potential, the challenges they face, and the exciting future they herald.What are Web3 AI Agents? A Fusion of Intelligence and Decentralization
At its core, a Web3 AI Agent is an AI-powered software program that can independently interact with blockchain networks and decentralized applications (dApps). It's not just a smart contract; it's an intelligent entity that can:Perceive (Web3 Data): These agents are designed to "see" and interpret the vast amount of data residing on blockchains. This includes real-time transaction streams, smart contract states, NFT metadata, DeFi protocol data (liquidity pools, lending rates), DAO proposals, and even market sentiment from decentralized social platforms.Reason (AI Models): Equipped with advanced AI models, primarily Large Language Models (LLMs) but also other machine learning algorithms, the agents process the perceived data. They understand complex contexts, identify patterns, infer knowledge, and analyze situations to make informed decisions.Plan (Goal-Oriented Logic): Unlike reactive chatbots, Web3 AI Agents can formulate multi-step plans to achieve specific, often complex, goals. This involves breaking down a high-level objective into a series of actionable steps within the decentralized environment. Businesses seeking to implement these sophisticated systems will often look for specialized expertise in crafting cutting-edge AI agent development solutions.Act (On-Chain Interactions): This is where the "Web3" truly comes into play. Agents can execute actions directly on the blockchain by:Sending signed transactions.Calling smart contract functions.Participating in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) by voting or proposing.Managing crypto wallets and digital assets (tokens, NFTs).Interacting with various dApps and decentralized protocols.Learn & Adapt (Continuous Improvement): They are designed for continuous improvement, learning from the outcomes of their actions, market feedback, and new information to refine their strategies and behaviors over time. Their "memory" can be sustained through decentralized storage solutions, allowing for persistent context and evolving intelligence.Self-Custody (Potential): In advanced iterations, a Web3 AI Agent might even possess its own crypto wallet, managing its own digital assets and participating directly in decentralized economies.This combination of AI intelligence with Web3's decentralization, transparency, verifiability, and censorship resistance makes Web3 AI Agents fundamentally different from traditional, centralized AI systems.The Driving Force: Why Web3 AI Agents Now?
The rise of Web3 AI Agents isn't accidental; it's a culmination of several technological advancements and growing demands for a more open and efficient internet:Maturity of LLMs: The exponential growth in LLM capabilities provides the "brain" for agents, enabling sophisticated natural language understanding, reasoning, and planning.Robustness of Blockchain Infrastructure: More scalable, efficient, and interconnected blockchain networks (Layer 2s, cross-chain bridges) make on-chain interactions feasible and cost-effective for automated agents.Demand for Decentralized Automation: As Web3 ecosystems grow in complexity (DeFi, DAOs, GameFi), the need for intelligent automation that doesn't rely on centralized intermediaries becomes critical.Emergence of Agent Development Frameworks: Specialized frameworks (which we'll touch upon later) are making it easier for developers to build, deploy, and manage these sophisticated agents.Focus on User Empowerment: Web3's core tenet is returning ownership and control to users. AI agents, when decentralized, align with this by offering personalized, autonomous assistance without compromising privacy or inviting censorship.Transformative Use Cases: A Glimpse into the Future
The implications of Web3 AI Agents span across virtually every sector touching digital economies:Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Revolution:Autonomous Portfolio Management: AI agents can monitor countless market variables (gas fees, liquidity pool rates, token prices, lending/borrowing yields) across multiple DeFi protocols in real-time. They can then autonomously execute strategies like rebalancing portfolios, optimizing yield farming positions, or engaging in arbitrage opportunities to maximize returns and minimize risk, all without manual intervention.Risk Management & Security: Proactively identifying and responding to potential exploits or anomalies in DeFi protocols. Imagine an agent detecting a flash loan attack in progress and initiating countermeasures.Liquidity Provisioning: Dynamically adjusting liquidity positions in decentralized exchanges based on market conditions to ensure optimal impermanent loss mitigation and fee generation.Empowering DAO Governance:Intelligent Proposal Summarization & Analysis: DAOs often face "voter fatigue" due to overwhelming numbers of complex proposals. AI agents can analyze proposals, summarize key points, highlight potential impacts, and even simulate voting outcomes, providing digestible insights to human members.Automated Voting Delegation: Members can delegate their voting power to an AI agent based on predefined criteria (e.g., "vote for proposals promoting sustainable energy," "vote against proposals increasing protocol fees"). The agent then consistently participates on their behalf, increasing decentralization and active governance.Treasury Management & Allocation: Agents can analyze market conditions and community needs to propose or even execute optimal asset allocation strategies for DAO treasuries.Revolutionizing Web3 Gaming & the Metaverse:Intelligent NPCs (Non-Player Characters): Beyond scripted behaviors, AI agents can power NPCs with dynamic personalities, adaptive dialogue, and the ability to learn and evolve. These NPCs could own their own wallets, participate in the game's economy (buying/selling NFTs, trading resources), and even initiate interactions with players based on their behavior.Dynamic Content Generation: AI agents can procedurally generate unique in-game assets, quests, or storylines that adapt to individual player choices and game states, creating endlessly engaging experiences.In-Game Economy Balancing: AI agents can monitor the health of a game's decentralized economy, dynamically adjusting token rewards, resource scarcity, and NFT minting rates to prevent inflation or deflation and ensure long-term sustainability.Anti-Cheat & Fraud Detection: AI agents can analyze player behavior on-chain and off-chain to detect sophisticated cheating, botting, or fraudulent activities that compromise fair play.Personalized Web3 Assistants:Onboarding & Education: For new users navigating the complexities of Web3, AI agents can act as personalized guides, explaining concepts like gas fees, wallet management, token standards, and guiding them through their first dApp interactions.Curated Information & Alerts: Agents can monitor specific blockchain addresses, NFT collections, or DeFi protocols, alerting users to important events, price changes, or new opportunities tailored to their interests.Digital Asset Management: Beyond trading, agents could help manage users' entire digital footprint, including NFT collections, managing proofs of identity, or organizing decentralized file storage.Cross-Chain Interoperability and Bridging:AI agents can monitor opportunities and liquidity across different blockchain networks, enabling seamless and optimized asset transfers or swaps between chains. They could identify the most efficient bridge or swap path for a user's assets.
Challenges on the Path to Widespread Adoption
Despite the immense promise, Web3 AI Agents face significant hurdles that development companies and researchers are actively working to overcome:Computational Cost & Scalability: Running complex AI models and frequent on-chain interactions can be computationally intensive and incur high gas fees. While Layer 2 solutions and off-chain computation (with on-chain verification) are mitigating factors, optimizing efficiency remains crucial.Data Privacy vs. Data Needs: AI models thrive on vast amounts of data, but Web3 prioritizes user privacy and data self-sovereignty. Striking a balance between providing enough data for effective AI operations and maintaining user privacy and decentralization is a complex challenge.Security Vulnerabilities: Autonomous agents interacting with real assets on a blockchain present high-stakes security risks. Bugs in the AI's logic, vulnerabilities in smart contract interactions, or susceptibility to adversarial attacks could lead to significant financial losses. Robust auditing, formal verification, and secure execution environments are paramount.Trust and Explainability (XAI): When an autonomous agent makes a critical decision (e.g., executing a large trade or voting on a crucial DAO proposal), users and stakeholders need to understand why that decision was made. Ensuring explainability and verifiability of agent actions is vital for building trust.Regulatory Landscape: The legal and regulatory frameworks for autonomous AI agents, especially those handling financial transactions in a decentralized manner, are still in their infancy. This uncertainty can hinder adoption by larger institutions.Interoperability and Standardization: While many individual agents are being developed, achieving seamless communication and collaboration between diverse AI agents across different blockchains and protocols requires common standards and robust interoperability layers."Hallucinations" and Unintended Actions: AI models, especially LLMs, can "hallucinate" or generate incorrect information. When this translates to autonomous actions on-chain, the consequences can be severe and irreversible. Robust guardrails, validation mechanisms, and human-in-the-loop oversight are crucial.The Road Ahead: A New Digital Frontier
The journey to fully realized Web3 AI Agents is a collaborative effort involving AI researchers, blockchain developers, cryptographers, and regulatory experts. Key areas of ongoing development include:Decentralized AI Infrastructure: Building robust, scalable, and cost-effective decentralized networks that can host and power AI agents. This includes decentralized compute, storage, and oracle networks.Agent-Specific Frameworks: Developing specialized frameworks and libraries that simplify the creation, deployment, and management of Web3 AI Agents, integrating LLM capabilities with blockchain interaction logic.Security Primitives: Innovations in zero-knowledge proofs, secure multi-party computation, and on-chain verification to enhance the security and verifiability of agent actions.Ethical AI Governance: Establishing clear guidelines and technical mechanisms to ensure Web3 AI Agents operate ethically, transparently, and in alignment with human values.The emergence of Web3 AI Agents marks a pivotal moment in the digital age. They are not merely tools for automation; they are intelligent, self-sovereign entities poised to transform industries, empower individuals, and unlock unprecedented levels of efficiency and innovation in decentralized environments.For businesses looking to fully embrace this paradigm shift, engaging with a reputable AI agent development company will be essential. If you're considering building your own intelligent entities, you'll want to hire AI agent developer talent with a deep understanding of blockchain and advanced AI. The burgeoning field of agentic AI development company will be at the forefront of this evolution, guiding organizations in integrating these powerful agents into their operations.Web3 AI Agents promise a future where digital interactions are more intelligent, autonomous, and aligned with the principles of decentralization, setting the stage for a truly transformative digital frontier.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Best IT Company in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India</title><link>https://dev.to/cmpglobalsolutions/best-it-company-in-ahmedabad-gujarat-india-1fed</link><author>CMP Global Solutions</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 11:22:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CMP Global Solutions is a leading IT solutions company based in Ahmedabad, India, delivering cutting-edge web development, software, and mobile app services globally.

  Building a Memory Matching Game with Amazon Q CLI + Pygame

In this blog, I walk through how I built a 2D memory matching game using Amazon Q CLI, an AI-powered coding assistant by AWS, combined with Python and the Pygame library.As someone exploring the intersection of AI and interactive tech, I was amazed at how Amazon Q CLI guided me through every step — from game logic to visual layout — simply by chatting with it. It was like pair programming with an AI mentor.This project was part of the “Build Games with Amazon Q CLI” challenge, and it opened up a new creative path for me — showing how AI can help bring even small, personal game ideas to life quickly and powerfully.To begin, I followed these steps:: Set up an AWS Builder ID
You need this to use Amazon Q CLI and join the AWS Builder community. It only takes a few minutes:https://community.aws: Install Amazon Q CLI
I installed the CLI on my local machine using the official instructions:: Install Python + Pygame
I used Python (3.x) and installed Pygame with:bash
Copy
pip install pygameWith these tools ready, I opened Amazon Q CLI, typed in my game prompt, and began building.I created a Memory Matching Game — a fun, visual challenge where the player flips over cards to find matching pairs.A grid of face-down cardsOn click, two cards are revealedIf they match: they stay visible; if not, they flip backThe game ends when all pairs are matchedThis game is perfect for kids, educators, and even beginners learning pattern recognition.
  
  
  How I Built It Using Amazon Q CLI:
_"Create a simple 2D memory matching game using Python and Pygame."
_
Amazon Q responded with step-by-step code that handled:Setting up the display windowMatching logic with memory resetsShowing success messages when the game was completeReplace symbols on the cardsImprove timing for mismatched card resetsThis was one of the smoothest experiences I’ve had turning an idea into a game — thanks to the conversational nature of Amazon Q CLI.Using Amazon Q CLI truly changed the way I think about coding.Rather than starting from scratch, I could collaborate with AI, adapt what it gave me, and learn while building. It felt empowering — especially as someone passionate about building tech that’s accessible and supportive of real-life needs.I could see how this would help:New coders learning PythonTeachers creating simple educational gamesParents introducing kids to game logicFor me, it also connects to my deeper mission through MDBot for Her — supporting women in tech by encouraging creativity, visibility, and growth.Want to build a game with just a few prompts?Start chatting with Amazon Q CLI and see how far your imagination goes.

Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
The simplest solutions are often the most elegant and efficient. This truth has been known since the Renaissance, as the famous saying “simplicity is the ultimate sophistication” is often attributed to Leonardo da Vinci.Simplicity may not always be possible, though, as some systems are complex by nature, consisting of many moving parts and layers. But that doesn’t mean they have to be complicated or difficult to understand. You can often break a bigger problem down into smaller and more manageable subproblems. Python offers a variety of tools to help you with that, such as list comprehensions, generators, iterators, and more.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.When it comes to the structure of your code, it’s generally preferable to keep things flat by avoiding deeply nested structures. In an earlier example, the lambda expression replaced an inner function, 
On the other side of the spectrum, you might feel tempted to cram as much code as possible into a single line. This is where the second statement comes in. Instead of using one long line of dense code, it’s usually better to spread the individual instructions out, making them easier to reason about.These rules of python have inspired me alot and I intend to work with them while coding python to make my codes less ambiguous and unique.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Get Started with pytest: The Best Python Testing Framework</title><link>https://dev.to/testrig/how-to-get-started-with-pytest-the-best-python-testing-framework-37mf</link><author>Testrig Technologies</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 09:00:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In our previous article — “Introduction to Python for Test Automation” — we discussed why Python is a powerful language for building automation testing frameworks. We also explored the benefits of Python’s readability, rich ecosystem, and seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines. Now, let’s go deeper and talk about how to practically implement test automation using one of Python’s most widely adopted testing libraries — pytest.pytest isn’t just a testing framework; it's an ecosystem designed for fast, scalable, readable, and maintainable test automation.
  
  
  Why pytest for Test Automation?
pytest offers a significant advantage over traditional unittest or nose:Function-based testing: No need to create classes unnecessarily.Automatic test discovery: Zero configuration needed to find test files.Powerful fixture system: Dependency injection for setup/teardown.Built-in assertions: Native assert statements with introspection.Massive plugin ecosystem: Support for parallel execution, HTML reports, mocking, and more.
  
  
  Step 1: Installing pytest
Start with setting up your environment.
pip install pytestOptional: Use a virtual environmentpython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate.bat     # Windows
pytest --version
  
  
  Step 2: Project Structure and Test Discovery
pytest uses convention over configuration, so if your files and test functions follow naming conventions, they’re automatically detected.File Naming Conventions
Test file must start with test_ or end with _test.pyTest function must start with test_project/
│
│   ├── test_login.py
│   └── conftest.py      # Shared fixtures and hooks
├── src/
│
└── pytest.ini           # Configuration filepytest will search for all matching tests under the current directory.
  
  
  Step 3: Writing Your First Test
Let's write a simple test to validate a function:def add(x, y):
    return x + ydef test_addition():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5collected 1 item
test_math.py .                                       [100%]pytest provides clean, readable, and color-coded output.
  
  
  Step 4: Configuring pytest with pytest.ini
Create a pytest.ini or pyproject.toml file to customize test behavior.[pytest]
addopts = -v --maxfail=2 --disable-warnings
python_files = test_*.py--maxfail: Stop after 2 failurestestpaths: Where pytest should look for testspython_files: Pattern for test files🔍 Pro Tip: For larger teams or CI/CD pipelines, version-controlling this config ensures consistency.
  
  
  Step 5: Fixtures – Reusable Setup Logic
pytest’s fixture system lets you abstract test setup and teardown into reusable functions:@pytest.fixture
def user_data():
    return {"username": "admin", "password": "secure123"}def test_username(user_data):
    assert user_data["username"] == "admin"
You can control how often a fixture is invoked:@pytest.fixture(scope="module")   # "function", "class", "module", "session"Fixtures improve test readability, modularity, and maintainability.pytest stands out as the most efficient, flexible, and developer-friendly framework for Python test automation. Whether you’re just starting out or scaling a large QA project, pytest offers the simplicity of writing tests, the power of fixtures, and the extensibility of plugins — all of which make it the go-to choice for modern test automation.By mastering the basics of pytest — from installation and configuration to writing and running tests — you're laying the foundation for a scalable, maintainable, and reliable automation suite.As a leading Web and mobile automation testing company, at Testrig Technologies, we help startups and enterprises build scalable test automation frameworks. Our QA engineers specialize in creating CI/CD-ready, Python-based testing architectures that reduce release cycles and improve quality at every stage.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Streamlit Dashboard: Let&apos;s analyse how Virat Kohli performs!</title><link>https://dev.to/dhanushdevadiga/streamlit-dashboard-lets-analyse-how-virat-kohli-performs-ian</link><author>Dhanush D</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 08:24:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi, I'm  — a front-end developer and passionate analyst. But at the same time, I’m also a cricket enthusiast and a fan of , arguably the best batsman in the world today.So, I thought, why not combine my love for  and ?

  Why Use ?
Using  instead of a hardcoded path makes your script more portable and environment-friendly.The  command searches for  in the user's current .This ensures the script runs with the correct interpreter, whether it's the system Python, a user-installed version, or one from a virtual environment.It's especially useful when your script might be run on different machines or OS configurations.In short: env** when you care about portability, especially across macOS, Linux distros, and dev environments.
  
  
  Making a Python Script Executable
Want to run your Python script directly from the terminal, just like a native command?Here’s how to do it in three simple steps:
  
  
  Step 1: Add a Shebang Line
Create a file called  and start it with the shebang:This tells the operating system to use Python 3 to run your script.
  
  
  Step 2: Make the Script Executable
Use the  command to give the script execute permissions:This step allows the script to be run as a standalone program.Now you can run the script directly from the terminal (no need to prefix it with ):That’s it, your Python script is now an executable command!
  
  
  Run Your Script from Anywhere (Add to )
By default, you can only run your script from the directory it lives in.But if you want to use it like a global command, from  in your terminal, just move it to a directory that’s included in your system’s .Rename and move your script to a directory in your  (e.g.,  or ):hello.py /usr/local/bin/hello
💡 You might need  to move files into system directories like . +x /usr/local/bin/hello
Now your Python script behaves just like any other command-line tool, clean, simple, and accessible globally.Tip: If you prefer to keep scripts in your home directory (e.g., ), make sure  is added to your . Add this line to your , , or : ~/.bashrc   
  
  
  A Note on File Extensions
Once your script has a proper shebang and executable permissions, the  extension becomes optional.For example, instead of naming your script , you can simply call it :hello.py /usr/local/bin/hello
Now you can run it just like any other system command:This is common practice for CLI tools, many system utilities are written in Python but .py** , keeping command names clean and professional.While dropping the extension is fine for production-ready or user-facing scripts, you may want to keep  during development to benefit from:: Syntax highlighting, linting, and type checking work best with  files.: Test runners, formatters (like  or ), and debuggers expect  files.Use  while developing or sharing source code.Drop it when installing or deploying the script as a command-line utility.
  
  
  Use Virtual Environments in Shebangs
If your script relies on third-party packages installed in a , you can make sure it always runs with the correct dependencies by pointing the shebang directly to the virtual environment’s Python interpreter:This ensures your script uses the specific Python interpreter, along with all the packages, from your virtual environment, rather than falling back to the system Python.Activate your virtual environment, then run:You'll get something like:/home/user/myproject/venv/bin/python
Use this path in your shebang:You should use this mainly if:You're deploying a script alongside a virtual environment.You want strict control over the Python version and dependencies.You're bundling a CLI tool for isolated use.💡: Hardcoding virtual environment paths can reduce portability. If the script is meant to be used across machines or by other users, prefer  and activate the virtual environment in the shell instead.The  is a simple but powerful feature that transforms your Python scripts into first-class command-line tools.By including it at the top of your file, you can:Run scripts directly without typing .Make your code more portable and easier to share.Build clean, user-friendly CLI tools and automation scripts.Use  for maximum portability.Don’t forget to make your script executable with .Move it to a directory in your  to run it from anywhere.With just a few extra steps, you can make your Python scripts behave like native Unix commands, cleaner, faster, and more professional.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Easiest Way to Build an AI Chatbot for Your Website (Full Dev Tutorial)</title><link>https://dev.to/zachary62/the-easiest-way-to-build-an-ai-chatbot-for-your-website-full-dev-tutorial-37kp</link><author>Zachary Huang</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 03:05:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Want to build an AI chatbot for your website, but worried about the complexity? Are you picturing a maintenance nightmare of endless data updates and complex pipelines? Good news. This tutorial shows you how to build a lightweight AI chatbot that learns directly from your live website. No vector databases, no manual updates—just a chatbot that works. The project is open-sourced on GitHub.
  
  
  1. That "Simple" Chatbot Project... Isn't
So, you want to build an AI chatbot for your website. It sounds easy enough. You call an API, write a clever prompt, and you're basically done, right?Except for one tiny, soul-crushing detail: Your brand-new AI knows... .It has no idea what your company sells, what your return policy is, or who you are. It's just an empty brain in a box. To make it useful, you have to feed it knowledge. And that's where the "simple" project becomes a total nightmare.
  
  
  The Old, Broken Way to Build a Chatbot's Brain
Here’s the standard, painful process everyone seems to follow: First, you go on a company-wide scavenger hunt, digging through folders and old emails to find every PDF, FAQ, and policy document you can. Then, you become a data janitor. You write a bunch of tedious scripts to chop all that messy information into clean little "chunks" the AI can understand.The Expensive Brain Surgery. Finally, you perform some expensive brain surgery. You set up a complicated (and often pricey) "vector database" and shove all those data chunks into it.After all that, you  have a chatbot that knows things. For about a day.
  
  
  And Now... Your Chatbot Is a Liar
The moment your bot goes live, it starts to rot.The marketing team updates the pricing page. The engineers release a new feature. Suddenly, your chatbot is confidently telling customers the wrong price. It's a walking, talking liability. You didn't build a smart AI assistant. You built a manual-syncing, high-maintenance chore that you have to babysit forever.But what if this entire approach is wrong? What if the knowledge base wasn't some clunky database you have to constantly update? What if...  was the brain? That’s the chatbot we’re building today. A bot so simple, it feels like cheating.This project is powered by PocketFlow, a tiny but mighty AI framework that makes building this kind of intelligent, looping agent incredibly straightforward. Forget vector databases and manual updates. Let's build a chatbot that just works.
  
  
  2. Our Solution: A "Dumb" Crawler That's Actually Smart
Let's throw that entire, complicated process in the trash. We are not going to hunt for documents, clean up data, or set up a single database.Instead, our chatbot will get its information directly from the source: your live website. Think of it like this. The old way is like printing a map once a year and hoping the roads don't change. Our new way is like using Google Maps on your phone—it's always live, always current.
  
  
  The Master Plan: Let the Bot Read
Our chatbot works like a very fast, very focused intern. When a user asks a question, the bot doesn't look up the answer in some dusty old database. Instead, it visits your website and starts reading, right then and there.Let's imagine your website has a realistic structure. A user asks a question that requires information from multiple places: "How do I get a refund for Product A?"The bot needs to be smart. It has to navigate the site to find  the relevant pieces of the puzzle. In the diagram below, the lines show all the possible links. The  shows the  our bot takes to find the answer.Here's a play-by-play of the bot's clever thought process:It starts on the Homepage. It sees both "refund" and "Product A" in the question. It decides to find the product page first to confirm the product's details.It navigates to the "Product A" page. It reads the content and finds key info, like a "30-day warranty," but it doesn't find the  for actually getting a refund.It intelligently changes course. It realizes the refund steps aren't on the product page. So, it thinks like a human would: "Okay, I need to find the general company policies." It navigates back to the site's main "Support" section to find the official information. It doesn't need a direct link; it understands the site's structure.It finds the final piece of the puzzle. On the Support page, it sees a link to "Shipping & Returns Policy," reads it, and learns the exact steps to submit a refund request.Now, it combines the "30-day warranty" from the product page with the "how-to steps" from the returns policy to give a perfect, comprehensive answer.
  
  
  Why This is So Much Better
The beauty of this approach is its simplicity.Your Knowledge is Always Fresh: You change your pricing? The bot knows instantly. You update your team bio? The bot knows that too. There is no sync step. There is no "stale data." Ever.There is Zero Maintenance: You never have to tell the bot about updates. Just update your website like you normally would, and the chatbot takes care of the rest.But what stops it from wandering off your site and crawling the entire internet? Simple. We give it a leash. We provide a list of approved website domains (like ) and tell it: "You are only allowed to visit links on these sites. Don't go anywhere else."This all sounds great, but building an agent that can make decisions and get stuck in a loop sounds complicated, right? You'd think you need a massive, heavy framework to manage that kind of logic.Actually, you don't. And that’s where PocketFlow comes in.
  
  
  3. PocketFlow: The Tiny Engine That Powers Our Bot
You wouldn't use a bulldozer to plant a single flower. In the same way, we don't need a massive, heavyweight AI framework for our straightforward crawling task. We need something small, fast, and built for exactly this kind of job.That's why we're using . PocketFlow is a minimalist AI framework that's just 100 lines of code. It has zero dependencies and zero fluff. Let's look at its three core ideas.
  
  
  The Node: A Specialist Worker
In PocketFlow, each task is a . A Node is like a specialist worker who is a pro at . Here’s what a Node looks like in the actual PocketFlow code:Don't worry if  or  look weird; they're just Python things! The important bit is the  cycle:: "Hey, I'm about to start. What info do I need from the  whiteboard?": "Okay, I have my info. Now I'll do my main job!" (Like calling an AI).: "Job's done! I'll write my results to the  whiteboard and tell the manager what to do next by returning a signal (like a keyword, e.g.,  or )."
  
  
  The Shared Store: The Central Whiteboard
This is just a plain old Python dictionary (we'll call it ). All our Node workers can read from it and write to it. It's how they pass information—like the user's question or the list of URLs to visit—to each other.For our chatbot, it might look like this initially:As Nodes do their work, they'll update this  dictionary.
  
  
  The Flow: The Workshop Manager
A  object is the manager of your workshop. You tell it which Node to start with, and it handles the rest. When you  a Flow, it just keeps doing one thing over and over: The Node finishes and returns a  (just a string, like ). The Flow looks at the Node's connections to see where that signal leads, and moves to the next Node.Here's how tiny the  manager class actually is in PocketFlow:That's it! It starts a  loop, runs a node, gets a signal, and finds the next node. If there's no next node for that signal, the loop ends.
  
  
  Tiny Math Example: PocketFlow in Action!
Let's build a super-tiny workflow: take a number, add 5, then multiply by 2.Notice  doesn't return anything? PocketFlow automatically treats that as the signal .Worker 2: The Multiplier NodeConnecting the Workers and Running the Flow:If you run this, you get exactly what you'd expect:Starting math game with: {'number_to_process': 10}
AddFive Node: Added 5, result is 15
MultiplyByTwo Node: Multiplied, final answer is 30
Math game finished. Whiteboard looks like: {'number_to_process': 10, 'intermediate_result': 15, 'final_answer': 30}
See? Each Node is simple. The  dictionary carries the data. The  manager makes sure  runs, then .Now, just swap our math workers for chatbot workers: becomes . becomes .  And instead of just a  signal,  will return  to loop back or  to move forward.The pattern is exactly the same. Now that we have our blueprint, let's build the three "workers" that make our chatbot come to life.
  
  
  4. Building the Brain: A Look Under the Hood
Alright, theory's over. Let's look at the actual code that makes our chatbot's brain tick. By the end of this section, you'll understand the entire backend, from the high-level workflow down to the individual "workers."(Note: We've simplified the code below to focus on the core ideas. For the complete, unabridged version, you can view the full code in the project on GitHub.)First, let's look at our workflow diagram. This is the entire brain of our operation: a simple loop.
  
  
  The Assembly Line Instructions ()
Before we build the individual workers, let's look at the instructions that tell them how to work together. This is our  file, and it's the "manager" that directs the assembly line.That's the entire orchestration logic. It's a simple, readable blueprint for our agent's behavior.
  
  
  The Shared Whiteboard ( dictionary)
Next, our workers need a central place to read and write information. This is just a simple Python dictionary that holds the state of our operation.Now let's look at the simplified code for our three specialist nodes.
  
  
  1. : The Librarian
This  efficiently processes a list of URLs. Its job is to read a page and return its text and any new links it finds. It crawls each page on its to-do list, stores the content, and adds any new, unique links to the master URL list.
  
  
  2. : The Brain
This node looks at what we've learned and decides what to do next, returning a signal to the Flow. It asks the AI for a strategy ( or ) and returns that exact signal to the Flow, which knows what to do next.
  
  
  3. : The Writer
Once the Brain says , this node crafts the final response. It gathers all the text we found, gives it to the AI, and asks it to write a beautiful, helpful response.And that's the core of the system. Three simple nodes, each with a clear job, passing data through a simple dictionary.Now that the magic is revealed (and you see it's not so magical after all), let's give our chatbot a pretty face so you can put it on your website.
  
  
  5. Giving Our Bot a Face: From Terminal to Website
Okay, we have a functional AI brain that runs in the terminal. That's a great start, but it's not very useful for your website visitors.Let's connect that brain to a user-friendly chat bubble. This is a classic web development pattern with two simple parts: a  (our Python script) and a  (the chat bubble on a website).
  
  
  The Architecture: A Brain and a Face
 This is our Python script, . Its only job is to wait for a question, run our PocketFlow logic to find the answer, and send the answer back. It's the powerhouse that does all the heavy lifting. This is a small piece of JavaScript, , that you add to your website. It creates the chat icon and the chat window. When a user types a question, the JavaScript simply sends it to our backend for processing.They communicate over the network. The frontend asks a question, and the backend provides the answer.Let's look at the minimal code that makes each part work.We use a lightweight Python framework called  to create a simple web server. Its job is to expose a single "endpoint" (like a URL) that the frontend can send questions to.Here’s the core logic in : The server waits for a POST request at . When it gets one, it runs the same PocketFlow we built before and sends the result back.This is the JavaScript that lives on your website. It listens for the user to click "send," then makes a simple web request to our Python backend.Here's the simplified logic from : When the user sends a message, it packages up the question and sends it to the  endpoint on our server. When the server responds, it displays the answer.Now the process is clear: First, you need to run the brain. In your terminal, run . This starts the web server and gets it ready to answer questions.Add the Frontend to a Page: Next, you add the <script src="chatbot.js"></script> tag to your website's HTML. This makes the chat bubble appear.To make testing easy, the project includes a sample  file that already has the script included. Once your server is running, just open that file in your browser to see your live, interactive chatbot in action
  
  
  6. Conclusion: Simple, Maintainable, and Live
Let's take a step back. We just built a fully-functional AI chatbot that can intelligently answer questions about any website.And we did it without touching a single vector database, writing a complex data-syncing script, or worrying about our information ever going stale. Its brain is your live website, which means its knowledge is always up-to-date.This isn't just another chatbot. This is a better, simpler way to build one. Here’s why this approach wins: Your bot’s knowledge is never stale. When you update your website, you've instantly updated your chatbot. There is no sync step, ever.Practically Zero-Maintenance. You can finally "set it and forget it." Your only job is to keep your website current—something you were already doing anyway. Because the entire system is built on PocketFlow and a few straightforward Python scripts, the logic is easy to read and modify. There are no black boxes to fight with.The days of babysitting your AI are over. You now have the blueprint for a system that’s not only intelligent but also practical and sustainable.Ready to add a real-time brain to your own website?The complete, open-source code for this chatbot is waiting for you on GitHub.

This detailed, focused observation is similar to how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) "see" images. These powerful algorithms are revolutionizing how computers process visual information, unlocking possibilities previously confined to the human mind.CNNs are a specialized type of artificial neural network, designed specifically for processing data with a grid-like topology, such as images and videos. Unlike traditional neural networks that treat data as a flat sequence, CNNs leverage the spatial relationships within data, making them exceptionally effective at image recognition, object detection, and more.Understanding the Core Concepts:At the heart of a CNN lies the "convolution" operation. Think of it like a magnifying glass sliding across an image. This magnifying glass, called a filter or kernel, is a small matrix of weights. As it moves across the image, it multiplies its weights with the corresponding pixel values under it, summing the results to produce a single number. This number represents a feature extracted from that specific area of the image. For example, one filter might be sensitive to edges, another to corners, and another to textures.This process is repeated across the entire image, creating a feature map – a representation of the image highlighting the presence and location of specific features. Multiple filters are used simultaneously, each detecting different features, resulting in multiple feature maps. These maps are then typically passed through a pooling layer, which downsamples the data, reducing its dimensionality while preserving important features. This process helps to make the network more efficient and less sensitive to small variations in the input.The output of the pooling layer then feeds into further convolutional and pooling layers, progressively extracting higher-level features. Finally, the extracted features are fed into a fully connected layer, similar to those in traditional neural networks, which performs the final classification or prediction.Significance and Problem Solving:CNNs address the long-standing challenge of enabling computers to understand and interpret visual information. Before CNNs became prevalent, image recognition relied on hand-crafted features and rules, a laborious and often inaccurate process. CNNs, however, learn these features directly from the data, achieving remarkable accuracy and efficiency.Applications and Transformative Impact:The impact of CNNs is far-reaching and spans numerous industries:  CNNs are used for disease detection in X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans, assisting radiologists in making faster and more accurate diagnoses.  They can detect subtle anomalies often missed by the human eye.  Object detection and recognition are crucial for autonomous vehicles.  CNNs enable cars to identify pedestrians, vehicles, traffic signs, and other obstacles, ensuring safe navigation.  From unlocking smartphones to security systems, CNNs power facial recognition technologies.  While raising ethical concerns (discussed below), their accuracy is continuously improving.Satellite Imagery Analysis:  CNNs analyze satellite images to monitor deforestation, track urban sprawl, and assess the impact of natural disasters.  CNNs help robots navigate complex environments, recognize objects, and perform tasks requiring visual input.Image Enhancement and Restoration:  CNNs are used to improve the quality of images, removing noise, sharpening details, and even inpainting missing parts of an image.Challenges, Limitations, and Ethical Considerations:Despite their remarkable success, CNNs face several challenges:  CNNs require vast amounts of labeled data for training, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain.  Training large CNNs can be computationally intensive, requiring powerful hardware and significant energy consumption.Explainability (Black Box Problem):  Understanding why a CNN makes a particular prediction can be difficult, raising concerns about transparency and accountability, especially in critical applications like medical diagnosis.  CNNs can inherit biases present in the training data, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.  Addressing this requires careful data curation and model evaluation.Security and Adversarial Attacks:  CNNs can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small, almost imperceptible changes to an image can lead to misclassification.  This poses security risks in applications like autonomous driving and security systems.Conclusion: A Future Shaped by SightConvolutional Neural Networks represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, revolutionizing our ability to process and understand visual information. While challenges remain, particularly concerning data bias and explainability, the potential benefits are immense. As research continues and computational power increases, CNNs will undoubtedly play an even more crucial role in shaping the future across various sectors, from healthcare and transportation to environmental monitoring and beyond.

This was the challenge that sparked "Yuh Hear Dem," our submission for the . The project began as a father-daughter mentoring journey into AI and evolved into a powerful tool for civic engagement in Barbados. It combines deep experience in backend AI architecture with a fresh perspective on user experience, guided by principles from the world of education. This blend allowed us to build a system that is not only technically sophisticated but also genuinely accessible, transforming the way citizens can interact with their government.This post details our technical journey, from the initial data pipeline to a crucial architectural pivot, all powered by Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK), Gemini, and a Knowledge Graph backend.
  
  
  The Problem: From Hours of Video to Actionable Insight
Parliamentary sessions in Barbados, like in many places, are published as long-form YouTube videos. Finding what a specific minister said about a particular topic, like the "sugar tax," requires manually scrubbing through hours of footage. This creates a significant barrier to civic engagement.Our goal was to transform this unstructured data into a structured, queryable format, allowing any citizen to ask a natural language question and get a direct, source-verified answer.
  
  
  The Solution: An AI-Powered Parliamentary Research Assistant
"Yuh Hear Dem" (Bajan dialect for "Did you hear them?") is a conversational agent that allows users to query parliamentary data. A user can ask, "What has been discussed about the sugar tax?" and receive a concise summary, direct quotes from MPs, and links to the exact moments in the source videos.The system is built on a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that combines the semantic power of vector search with the structured precision of a knowledge graph.
  
  
  The Technical Architecture: A Three-Stage Pipeline
Our system is built on a robust data processing and retrieval pipeline.1. Ingest, Clean, ExtractThe foundation of our system is a structured knowledge base built from raw, messy transcripts. We start by ingesting the full YouTube transcripts from hundreds of parliamentary session videos—over 1,200 hours of content. The raw transcripts are often riddled with grammatical errors and misattributions. We use  to clean and structure this text, correcting grammar, identifying speakers, and aligning the text with accurate video timestamps. With clean, timestamped text, we use Gemini again to perform entity and relationship extraction. It identifies people, topics, bills, and the connections between them (e.g., "Minister X  Bill Y"). This structured data, including over 33,000 nodes and 86,000 statements, is stored in .This process creates a rich, interconnected Knowledge Graph that forms the backbone of our agent's "brain."2. Hybrid Retrieval with GraphRAGWhen a user asks a question, the agent doesn't just rely on a simple semantic search. It uses a hybrid retrieval strategy: We run a vector search over MongoDB Atlas embeddings to find semantically similar transcript segments. This is great for broad, topic-based queries. We traverse the entities and relationships in our knowledge graph to find precise connections (e.g., Minister -> Topic -> Session). This excels at specific, factual queries.The results are combined and ranked using a hybrid scoring model (GraphRAG), giving us the best of both worlds. Critically, every piece of information is grounded in video timestamps, allowing us to generate direct links to the source.3. The Agent Architecture Evolution: A Lesson in PragmatismOur journey with ADK taught us a valuable lesson about the current state of multi-agent frameworks.The Original Vision: A Multi-Agent PipelineInitially, we designed a classic multi-agent system using a . The idea was to have a clear separation of concerns: The main entry point.ResearchPipeline (): Collects data from our knowledge graph. Enriches the data with video sources and timestamps. Synthesizes the final response.The Roadblock: Session State ManagementWe quickly hit a wall. We found that  was not being reliably shared between the agents in our  pipeline. The  would fetch data, but by the time the flow reached the  or , the state was often empty or corrupted.This appears to be a known challenge, which we tracked in GitHub Issue #1119. This roadblock became a critical learning moment: while the theory of multi-agent systems is powerful, the practical implementation can be fraught with state management complexities.The Pivot: A Robust Single-Agent SolutionTo solve this, we refactored our architecture into a single intelligent agent with a set of specialized function tools. This approach proved to be far more reliable and easier to debug.The agent maintains context reliably, and the tools are called synchronously, ensuring data is passed correctly.This pragmatic pivot allowed us to achieve our desired modularity—with each tool handling a specific task—without the overhead and unreliability of inter-agent state management.
  
  
  The User Experience: Making AI Accessible
Technology is only as good as its interface. Our focus on educational design was instrumental here. The frontend was built to make the agent's powerful capabilities accessible to everyone.Key design principles included: Information is presented in expandable cards, preventing cognitive overload. Users see a high-level summary first and can expand for details. We used D3.js to create interactive knowledge graphs, helping users visually understand the relationships between speakers, topics, and sessions. The agent uses the knowledge graph to generate relevant follow-up questions, guiding users on natural exploration paths.
  
  
  Conclusion and What's Next
"Yuh Hear Dem" is more than just a technical demo; it's a functioning tool for enhancing democratic transparency. Our journey taught us several key lessons: Combining knowledge graphs and vector search provides superior retrieval accuracy. While multi-agent state sharing needs maturing, ADK’s single-agent with function tools model is incredibly robust for building complex, reliable AI systems. A simpler, more reliable architecture is often better than a theoretically "purer" but fragile one.Human-Centered Design is Key: An intuitive UI, grounded in learning principles, is essential for making powerful AI accessible and useful.We invite you to explore the project yourself.Our next steps involve expanding the data sources to include official legislative documents and exploring a return to a multi-agent architecture as the ADK framework evolves. For now, we're proud to have built a tool that helps citizens hear what really matters.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>QuCode - 21DaysChallenge - Day 18</title><link>https://dev.to/paulobmsousa/qucode-21dayschallenge-day-18-2im1</link><author>Paulo B.M.

You're ready to demo it to stakeholders. You fire up your Jupyter notebook, load your carefully curated dataset, and... it works perfectly! Then someone asks: "Great! When can users actually use this?" You realize you have a model that works in a notebook but no idea how to get real data into it, how to serve predictions at scale, or how users will actually interact with it. You've built the engine but forgotten the car.Sound familiar? You've fallen into the  🪤—building sophisticated models that can't bridge the gap to production. This is where AI tracer bullets come to the rescue.
  
  
  🎯 The Original Tracer Bullets: A Quick Refresher
If you've read  📖, you know tracer bullets as a way to build software incrementally. Instead of building components in isolation, you create a thin end-to-end slice that connects all the major parts of your system.Traditional tracer bullets gave us:: See how components work together: Find integration problems early: Stakeholders see working software quickly: Adjust direction based on real feedbackIn traditional software, this might mean connecting a simple UI to a database through an API—minimal functionality, but the whole pipeline works.
  
  
  🤖 AI Tracer Bullets: End-to-End Intelligence
AI projects have a unique challenge: they're not just about moving data around, they're about extracting intelligence from it. An AI tracer bullet is a minimal, production-quality slice that spans:: Real data sources, not curated CSVs: Actual predictions, not hardcoded responses
: Users can see and act on results: It runs somewhere other than your laptopThe goal isn't to build the best possible model—it's to prove that your concept can work in the real world.I've seen countless AI projects die because teams focused on model accuracy instead of end-to-end viability:📊 "Our model is 96% accurate!" (on carefully cleaned training data)⏱️ "Inference takes 30 seconds" (acceptable in research, death in production) (your production environment has 4GB)🔌 "Just feed it this exact CSV format" (real data is never that clean)An AI tracer bullet forces you to confront these realities early, when you can still pivot.

                            ⏱️ TIMELINE: 8-13 DAYS MAX
                            🎯 OBJECTIVE: RAPID VALIDATION
                            💡 PRINCIPLE: FAIL FAST, LEARN FASTER
: Sequential progression required: Experience feedback and possible adjustments: Key steps with specific deliverables: Strict time constraint to avoid over-engineeringAfter building (and failing with) several AI projects, I developed this framework. It's saved me months of wasted effort:
  
  
  1. 📋 Minimal Dataset Selection: Use real, messy data from day one: 100-1000 samples max for initial validation: Bad data, missing fields, weird formatsReal talk: If your model can't handle messy data in the tracer bullet, it won't handle production data either. 💀
  
  
  2. 🔌 Model Endpoint Integration: Hugging Face, OpenAI API, or cloud services: If you need custom training, fake it first: How does your app talk to the model?Don't build a custom model until you know the integration works. 🎯
  
  
  3. 🚰 Thin Pipeline Implementation: Just enough to make it work: Log failures, don't crash: Know when things breakYour pipeline will evolve. Start simple, add complexity later. 🔧
  
  
  4. 🧪 : Real request → model → response: Track inference time and resource usage: Catch bad inputs earlyIf it's not tested, it's broken. Even for POCs. ✅
  
  
  5. 🔄 : User behavior, model performance, system load: What's the next most critical piece?: Only add complexity when you need itEach iteration should prove or disprove a key assumption about your AI concept. 📊
  
  
  💻 Real Code: Building an AI Tracer Bullet
Let me show you what this looks like in practice. Here's a complete AI tracer bullet for a document classification system—the kind of thing that could take months to "do properly" but can be validated in days.I'll show you two implementations: Python (Flask) for data science teams and JavaScript (Node.js) for frontend-heavy teams:For JavaScript/Node.js teams, here's the equivalent tracer bullet:
  
  
  🔍 What Makes This a Tracer Bullet?
This isn't just a prototype—it's a  that proves the concept:: Accepts messy input, handles edge cases: Uses a real model, not mock responses: Other systems can integrate with it: Runs as a service, includes health checks: Logs performance, catches errorsYou can deploy this to a cloud service today and start getting real user feedback. More importantly, you'll discover the real challenges:How long does inference actually take? ⏱️What happens when users send weird input? 🤔How much memory/CPU does it need? 💾Can it handle concurrent requests? 👥
  
  
  🎯 The Tracer Bullet Advantage
Here's what happened when I started using AI tracer bullets instead of traditional POCs:Instead of 3 months building a perfect model, I spent 3 days proving the concept was viable (or not). When it wasn't viable, I pivoted early instead of doubling down on a doomed approach.
  
  
  🔧 Real Integration ChallengesI discovered that our "95% accurate" sentiment model was useless because inference took 45 seconds. The tracer bullet forced us to find a faster model before we'd invested months in the slow one.Showing a working demo (even a simple one) gets way more excitement than showing accuracy charts. Non-technical stakeholders can actually  the tracer bullet.Each iteration adds one more critical piece. Maybe it's better data processing, maybe it's model optimization, maybe it's UI improvements. You're always building on something that works.
  
  
  📊 Real Case Study: E-commerce Content Moderation
Let me share a concrete example from a client project that demonstrates the power of AI tracer bullets:: An e-commerce platform needed to automatically moderate user-generated product reviews for inappropriate content (spam, hate speech, fake reviews). (what they almost did):📊 Spend 8-12 weeks building a custom classification model
🧪 Achieve 94% accuracy on curated test data💾 Require 16GB RAM and custom GPU infrastructure📝 Total estimated cost: $150k and 6 months to productionOur Tracer Bullet Approach (what we actually did):: Built the Node.js tracer bullet using OpenAI's moderation API⚡ 3 days to working end-to-end demo🔧 Integrated with their existing review system📊 Started processing real user reviews immediately✅  on real production data (better than planned custom model!)⚡ 200ms average response time (vs. projected 45 seconds)💰 $500/month operational cost (vs. $150k development cost)🚀 Zero infrastructure changes needed that saved the project:API latency was acceptable: 200ms vs. feared "too slow for real-time": 10k reviews/day fit well within API limits
Edge cases were different: Real spam was simpler than test data suggestedIntegration was the hard part: Not the AI, but webhook reliability and error handling🎯  instead of 6 months💰  in development costs📈  due to cleaner review sections🔄 : Easy to swap AI providers or add custom models laterThis is the power of AI tracer bullets: real validation with real metrics in real time.
  
  
  🚀 Beyond POCs: Production-Ready Thinking
The magic of AI tracer bullets isn't just speed—it's that they force you to think like a production system from day one:: How do you validate inputs?: How do you know if it's working?: Can it handle real load?: How do you update the model?According to recent research: show that 85% of AI projects fail to reach production indicate average AI POC takes 6 months, but 70% never see production demonstrate API-based inference is 3-10x faster than local deployment for most use casesThe primary reason for failures? Teams focus on model accuracy instead of system integration. AI tracer bullets flip this priority.💡 : Use Hugging Face Inference Endpoints for your first tracer bullet—they handle scaling, caching, and model optimization automatically. Perfect for validating concepts before committing to infrastructure.💡 : Always log three metrics from day one: inference time, input size, and error rate. These will guide your scaling decisions later.💡 : Network timeouts kill user experience. Set aggressive timeouts (5-10s max) and always have fallback responses ready.The next time you're tempted to spend weeks perfecting a model in isolation, try this instead:Identify smallest end-to-end sliceClear success/failure criteriaUse pre-trained models, cloud APIsWorking demo in days, not weeksUse messy, incomplete real dataDiscover real blockers earlyTrack performance, accuracy, UXData-driven decisions for v2Let usage drive next improvementsContinuous value deliveryRemember: The goal isn't to build the perfect AI system. It's to prove your concept can work in the real world, then make it better.💡 : Pick one of the code examples above, replace the model with your use case (OpenAI API, Google Vision, etc.), and deploy to Vercel/Heroku in under an hour. You'll learn more in that hour than in weeks of model tweaking.

You're not alone! Many developers find themselves wrestling with boilerplate code and confusing configurations. FastAPI swoops in as a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ that's actually  to use. This guide will walk you through creating your first production-ready FastAPI application, even if you're a complete beginner.
  
  
  What Makes FastAPI So Special?
Why choose FastAPI over other frameworks like Flask or Django REST Framework? Well, FastAPI offers several key advantages: Built on top of Starlette and Pydantic, FastAPI delivers blazing-fast performance, comparable to NodeJS and Go.Automatic Data Validation: Pydantic handles data validation and serialization, reducing errors and simplifying your code.Automatic API Documentation: FastAPI generates interactive API documentation (using Swagger UI and ReDoc) automatically, making it easy to test and explore your API. Leverages Python type hints for improved code readability and maintainability. A powerful design pattern built right in that simplifies testing and code organization.Let's dive into creating a simple "To-Do" API to illustrate these features.
  
  
  Setting Up Your Environment
Before we write any code, let's set up our development environment. I recommend using a virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies.Create a Virtual Environment:Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory. Then, run the following command:Activate the Virtual Environment:*   On macOS/Linux:

    bash
    source venv/bin/activate

*   On Windows:

    bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
Install FastAPI and Uvicorn:Uvicorn is an ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) server that we'll use to run our FastAPI application. Run this command to install both:bash
pip install fastapi uvicornThat's it! Your environment is ready. A virtual environment keeps your project dependencies separate, avoiding conflicts. Always activate it before working on your project.
  
  
  Building Your First API Endpoint
Now for the fun part! Let's create a simple API endpoint that returns a list of to-do items. Create a file named  in your project directory and add the following code:python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModelclass Todo(BaseModel):
    id: int
    completed: bool = Falsetodos = [
    Todo(id=1, task="Learn FastAPI", completed=True),
    Todo(id=2, task="Build a to-do API", completed=True),
    Todo(id=3, task="Deploy the API", completed=False),@app.get("/todos", response_model=List[Todo])
async def get_todos():
    """Retrieves all to-do items."""
    return todos@app.post("/todos", response_model=Todo)
async def create_todo(todo: Todo): # Notice the type hinting! FastAPI validates the incoming data against the Todo model
    """Creates a new to-do item."""
    todos.append(todo)Let's break down what's happening here: We import  to create our application,  for type hinting, and  from  to define our data model. We define a  class using . This class represents a to-do item and includes fields for , , and . Pydantic handles automatic validation and serialization based on this model. We create an instance of the  class, which will be our main application object.  We create a list of sample  objects for demonstration purposes. We define a GET endpoint at  using the  decorator.  The response_model=List[Todo] argument tells FastAPI to serialize the returned data as a list of  objects. The  keyword indicates that this is an asynchronous function, which is crucial for FastAPI's performance. We define a POST endpoint also at  using the  decorator. This endpoint takes a  object as input (notice the type hint ). FastAPI automatically validates the incoming data against the  model. If the data is invalid, FastAPI will return an error response. The new  is appended to the  list and returned.✅   FastAPI uses type hints extensively.  This not only improves code readability but also enables automatic data validation and API documentation.To run your API, execute the following command in your terminal:bash
uvicorn main:app --reload is the name of the file where your FastAPI application is defined. is the name of the FastAPI instance. enables automatic reloading, so your server will restart whenever you make changes to your code.   Don't use  in production!Now, open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs. You should see the Swagger UI, which provides interactive documentation for your API. You can use it to test your endpoints. Uvicorn runs your FastAPI app. The  flag is great for development but avoid it in production.
  
  
  Going Further: Automatic API Documentation
One of the coolest features of FastAPI is its automatic API documentation. As you saw in the previous step, navigating to  provides a Swagger UI interface.  FastAPI also provides an alternative documentation interface at .FastAPI generates this documentation based on the type hints and docstrings in your code. This makes it incredibly easy to keep your API documentation up-to-date.✅   Write clear and concise docstrings for your API endpoints.  These docstrings will be displayed in the API documentation. Embrace FastAPI's auto-generated docs. It saves time and keeps your API understandable.In this tutorial, you've learned how to create a simple yet powerful API using FastAPI. You've seen how FastAPI leverages type hints, Pydantic, and automatic documentation to streamline the development process.Next steps?

Don't forget to follow me on Medium and show your support. Thank you! Your support means the world!Creating tailored languages and interpreters in Python allows me to solve specialized problems with elegant, readable tools. When building domain-specific tools, I focus on techniques that maintain Python's clarity while extending its capabilities. Here are eight methods I regularly use, each with practical applications.

Text command parsing turns natural language into actions. I often use regex with dataclasses to process user inputs cleanly. This approach works well for chatbots and CLI tools where intuitive commands matter.


python
from dataclasses import dataclass@dataclass
class Command:
    subject: strdef interpret(input_text):
    cmd_pattern = r"^(?P\w+)\s+(?P\w+)(?:\s+using\s+(?P.*))?$"
    match = re.match(cmd_pattern, input_text)
    if not match: mods = {}
if mod_str := match.group("mods"):
    pairs = [p.split(":") for p in mod_str.split(";")]
    mods = {k.strip(): v.strip() for k,v in pairs}

return Command(
    verb=match.group("verb").lower(),
    subject=match.group("subject").lower(),
    modifiers=mods
)
user_cmd = interpret("resize image using width:800; height:600")
print(f"Action: {user_cmd.verb}, Object: {user_cmd.subject}, Settings: {user_cmd.modifiers}")
Operator overloading creates intuitive domain objects. By defining special methods like `__add__` or `__mul__`, I build expressive APIs for scientific computing. This technique makes complex operations feel native.


python
    def (self, elements):
        self.composition = elementsdef __add__(self, other):
    new_comp = {}
    for elem, count in {**self.composition, **other.composition}.items():
        new_comp[elem] = self.composition.get(elem,0) + other.composition.get(elem,0)
    return ChemicalCompound(new_comp)

def __repr__(self):
    return "+".join(f"{count}{elem}" for elem, count in self.composition.items())
water = ChemicalCompound({"H":2, "O":1})
oxygen = ChemicalCompound({"O":2})
reaction = water + oxygen
print(reaction)  # 2H+3O
AST transformations modify code behavior during compilation. I use Python's `ast` module to inject domain logic directly into the parse tree. This is powerful for adding custom optimizations.

class LogInjector(ast.NodeTransformer):
    def visit_FunctionDef(self, node):
        log_stmt = ast.Expr(value=ast.Call(
            func=ast.Name(id='print', ctx=ast.Load()),
            args=[ast.Constant(value=f"Calling {node.name}")],
            keywords=[]
        node.body.insert(0, log_stmt)source_code = """
def calculate(a, b):
"""
tree = ast.parse(source_code)
modified = LogInjector().visit(tree)
exec(compile(modified, "", "exec"))
calculate(3, 4)  # Prints "Calling calculate"
Parser combinators handle complex grammars elegantly. Libraries like `parsy` let me construct recursive parsers through composition. I find this ideal for SQL-like mini-languages.


python
from parsy import string, regex, seqkey = regex(r"[a-zA-Z_][\w]*")
value = regex(r"[^\n]+")
    key << string("="),
).combine(lambda k, v: (k, v.strip()))config_parser = assignment.sep_by(regex(r"\s*"))config_data = config_parser.parse("""
color = blue
shape = circle
print(dict(config_data))  # {'color':'blue','size':'large','shape':'circle'}
Symbol tables manage execution contexts. I implement custom environments for safe evaluation, which is crucial when processing untrusted inputs.


python
    def (self):
        self.variables = {}
        self.allowed_functions = {"min": min, "max": max}def set(self, name, value):
    self.variables[name] = value

def run(self, expr):
    return eval(expr, {"__builtins__": None}, {**self.variables, **self.allowed_functions})
env = SafeEnvironment()
env.set("x", 10)
result = env.run("min(x, y) + 5")
Metaclasses shape class behavior at definition time. I use them to enforce domain rules automatically, such as validation for financial models.


python
class FieldValidator(type):
    def (cls, name, bases, dct):
        fields = [k for k, v in dct.items() if isinstance(v, Field)]fields'] = fields
        return super()._(cls, name, bases, dct)class Field:
    def (self, min_val, max_val):
        self.min = min_valclass Trade(metaclass=FieldValidator):
    amount = Field(1, 10000)def __init__(self, amount):
    if not (self._fields[0].min <= amount <= self._fields[0].max):
        raise ValueError("Invalid trade amount")
    self.amount = amount
try:
    t = Trade(15000)  # Raises ValueError
    print(e)
Recursive descent parsers handle nested structures. When I need full control over parsing, I implement token-by-token processing.


python
    def (self, expression):
        self.tokens = iter(expression.replace(" ", ""))
        self.current = next(self.tokens, None)def advance(self):
    self.current = next(self.tokens, None)

def parse(self):
    return self.expr()

def expr(self):
    result = self.term()
    while self.current in ('+', '-'):
        op = self.current
        self.advance()
        term = self.term()
        result = result + term if op == '+' else result - term
    return result

def term(self):
    result = self.factor()
    while self.current in ('*', '/'):
        op = self.current
        self.advance()
        fac = self.factor()
        result = result * fac if op == '*' else result / fac
    return result

def factor(self):
    if self.current == '(':
        self.advance()
        result = self.expr()
        if self.current != ')':
            raise SyntaxError("Mismatched parentheses")
        self.advance()
        return result
    else:
        return self.number()

def number(self):
    num_str = ''
    while self.current and self.current.isdigit():
        num_str += self.current
        self.advance()
    return int(num_str)
calc = MathParser("(3+2)*4")
print(calc.parse())  # 20
Decorators extend functions for domain tasks. I wrap core logic with context managers to handle resources like database connections automatically.


python
def database_transaction(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Opening database connection")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("Committing transaction")
        return result@database_transaction
def save_record(data):
    print(f"Persisting {data}")save_record({"id": 101, "status": "active"})
These techniques form a versatile toolkit for building specialized languages. Each approach balances expressiveness with Python's inherent readability. When I design domain-specific tools, I start with the simplest method that solves the problem, gradually adopting more advanced techniques as requirements evolve. The real power comes from combining these approaches - like using parser combinators with AST transformations or decorators with operator overloading. This flexibility lets me create solutions that feel like natural extensions of Python rather than foreign constructs.
