Agriculture plays a vital role in feeding the global population, making it essential to improve productivity and efficiency in this sector. One of the key challenges in modern agriculture is the accurate classification of agricultural products, which directly impacts quality control, pricing, and supply chain management. Traditional methods of classification often rely on manual inspection, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors.With the rise of data-driven technologies, Machine Learning (ML) offers a powerful alternative to automate and enhance agricultural product classification. By analyzing dimensional and shape factors, ML algorithms can accurately classify various agricultural products, reducing manual labor and increasing efficiency. This project explores how machine learning techniques can be applied to classify agricultural products using real-world data, leading to smarter agricultural practices and better decision-making.📊 Project Overview

  Chapter 2: Continuous Integration (ci)
Having a ci is mandatory for any project that aims at having multiple contributors. In the following chapter, a proposal ci will be implemented.As ci implementation is specific to a collaborative platform being , , ,  etc. The following chapter will try to provide a technology agnostic ci as much as possible.Similar concepts are available in all ci, you will have to transpose the concepts that will be used here.The ci here will be very minimal but showcases concepts that you implemented in Chapter 1, namely:There are many more addition to the continuous integration that will not be tackled here. A minimal ci is required to guarantee non regressions in terms of:code styling rules to guarantee no indivual contributors diverge from the coding styletests, namely all tests must be passing is expecting ci files to be provided at a specific location, you can therefore create a file in .github/workflows/ci.yaml.In this file, you can addThe  and  define the names of the pipeline that will run.The  defines the event that will trigger the pipeline to run,  means that for every commit the pipeline will run.The  defines a list of jobs, the ci is made of one job with multiple steps for the sake of simplicity.The  defined the docker image used to run (the runner) the environment against, it's a list of docker images maintained by .Now into the steps section we can add:The  is the  action that checkout the current branch of the repository.The  is the  action that will read the  and install everything for us.The  step will install the dependencies and run the formatting. It there is an error, the command will fail and the pipeline too.The  step will run the tests. It there is an error, the command will fail and the pipeline too.As it was stated, the ci is the only source of truth. If it passes on ci, it should pass on your local setup. If not, it means there are discrepancies between the ci setup and yours.Going through the ci implementation will help you on reproducibility. Maybe you're not using the same way to install python version, or the same dependency management tool. You need to align your tools and the ones presented in chapter 1 help not to conflict with your local setup. You might have installed python package globally or you might have manually changed  or your  and this can easily be a mess.To help on reproducibility, a dev container approach can be used. It means, the ci will run inside a container and this container can be reused as a developer environment. This will not be implemented for the moment.To improve readability and segregates between code formatting and testing,  actions can be implemented as job with interdependencies. Then, the workflow becomes:In here we added the  to create dependencies between ci job. It means, we will not run the tests until the code style is compliant; this will save some time and resources. Indeed, if the code is not formatted, don't even bother running the tests. The execution graph will be like:We can see here some duplication, which is not ideal as for future code improvements, you will have to do it at two places at the same time. This is technical debt that one would have to tackle using composite action. We will consider it's ok for now.
  
  
  Caching dependency resolution
You will see additional steps in the , namely related to cacheThese steps aim at caching the  when there are no changes on the  and reusing it. The intent is to speed up the ci execution as dependency resolution and installation can be time consuming.An extra step to minimize caching size is added as  proposes such feature, namely an extra step and an environment variable is added to configure the location of the cache.On the next chapter, you will implement your first spark code and implement a way to guarantee test automation of it. This is long overdue as we spent 3 chapters on setup...You can find the original materials in spark_tdd.

I'm Shrijith Venkatrama, founder of Hexmos. Right now, I’m building LiveAPI, a tool that makes generating API docs from your code ridiculously easy.
  
  
  Training: Changing  based on  slightly (accorindg to Learning Rate)
From the previous post - we created   a list of all the nodes in the neural network.In total we have  neurons:One of the neuron's data value is shown below:Now the goal is to change the data value of this neuron, in accordance with the gradient feedback.for p in n.parameters():
    p.data += 0.01 * p.grad # something like that (wip)
We also note that the gradient is negative for that neuron:
  
  
  Determining the sign of the step factor So there's a bit of reasoning to do here, to determine the sign of step factor.The goal is to minimize the loss (bring loss = 0). is negative - .In , the result is  is decreased a bit, increasing the loss.But in , the result is  is increased a bit, reducing the loss.So therefore, the correct option is to have a negative step factor.Now we can see that the loss before/after weight adjustment and conclude that - through the backward pass plus gradient descent, we got a more accurate result:
  
  
  Automating Gradient Descent To Get a Highly Accurate Network
Setting the right learning rate value is a subtle art. If it is too low, it takes too long to converge. If it is too large a step size, the process gets unstable and may explode the loss. So finding the perfect rate is a subtle art.
  
  
  Implementing a Training Loop
We put a loop repeating the forward pass, backward pass and weight updates process:The training gives an output like this:0 4.149044341397712

You can see that the loss is getting to really small numbers near the final passes.Now we compare actual y to predicted y:And we get perfect results:actual [1.0, -1.0, -1.0, 1.0]
predicted [
    Value(data=1.0, grad=0.0, label=''), 
    Value(data=-0.9986538494836703, grad=0.0026923010326593833, label=''), 
    Value(data=-0.9993079543151291, grad=0.0013840913697418245, label=''), 
    Value(data=1.0, grad=0.0, label='')
]

  
  
  Fixing a subtle bug in the training loop
Each of the neurons in the net has weight and grad attributes.In our training loop, the first iteration is fine - when we do  we fill in the grad values for each neuron.But on the second iteration and next, we keep accumulating the grad values (and are never reset to 0).So the feedback given to each neuron could be slightly wrong. We have to reset grad to 0.We get a similar result as above in this case, since the problem was quite a simple one. It so happens in neural network that sometimes, we seem to get a successful result even when the logic is a bit buggy. For complex problems, these sorts of issues/bugs can derail the solution process - and one has to watch out for common mistakes.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Build Your Own AI Agents - From Scratch &amp; with Frameworks!

Only  library is used.Full source code will be given at the end.We only need to install  library.We will define 2 tools. One is to get today's date and the other is to convert the timezone.We also define  which stores the details about the tools. The key of the map is the function name.  is the details we will send to LLM and  is the function we will call.If your tools perform sensitive operations, you should verify or sanitize the parameters first.We apply "ReAct Prompting" to enable act and reasoning abilities. This also allows us to use tools.In order to make LLM stop generating after proposing an action, we ask it to output "PAUSE" text after an action.Before we see the actual code of AI agent, we check the pseudocode first.We have a loop to keep sending messages to LLM and performing actions.messages = [system_prompt, question_prompt]

completion = chat(llm, messages)
add completion to messages with role 'assistant'

while 'Final Answer' is not in completion and maximum round is not reached:

  If 'Action' is not found in completion:
    continue
  action = parse_action(completion)

  If 'Action Input' is not in completion:
    continue
  action_input = parse_action_input(completion)

  result = action(acion_input)

  add result to messages with role 'assistant'

  completion = chat(llm, messages)
  add completion to messages with role 'assistant'
 function is straight forward. It only creates chat completion with the messages we have.Stop word "PAUSE" is used to make LLM stop generation after proposing an action.We use regular expression to extract tool function name. Tool function will be returned. We also make sure tool function is defined in  for security reason.You can also change the system prompt to ask LLM returning JSON to ease parsing. function
As same as , we use regular expression to extract parameters of tool.Here is the implementaiton of the above pseudocode.Question: Convert 13:49 today in London time to Japan time. Please consider daylight saving.
Chat completion:
Thought: To accurately convert 13:49 London time to Japan time, it's important to consider the current date and whether daylight saving time is in effect. I'll first fetch the current date in the "Europe/London" timezone to understand if daylight saving time needs to be taken into account.
Action: get_today_date
Action Input: "Europe/London"

Action result: 2025-02-23
Chat completion:
Thought: Today is February 23, 2025. Daylight saving time in London typically starts on the last Sunday in March and ends on the last Sunday in October. Therefore, currently, London is on Greenwich Mean Time (GMT, UTC+0). Japan does not observe daylight saving time and is always on Japan Standard Time (JST, UTC+9). I will now convert 13:49 London time to Japan time for today.
Action: convert_timezone
Action Input: "Europe/London", "Asia/Tokyo", 2025, 2, 23, 13, 49

Action result: 2025-02-23 22:49:00+09:00
Chat completion:
Thought: I have successfully converted 13:49 London time to Japan time. The converted time is 22:49 on February 23, 2025.
Final Answer: 13:49 in London on February 23, 2025, is 22:49 in Japan time.

SPR을 통한 에피토프 비닝의 원리를 간략하게 설명하면 다음과 같습니다. 첫번째 항체를 고정시켜 놓고 항원과 두번째 항체를 넣어서 RU값을 측정하는데, 에피토프가 겹치지 않는 경우에 RU 값이 높게 측정됩니다. 즉, 에피토프가 비슷한 경우는 RU 값이 낮게 측정되는 것입니다. 이제 SPR을 통해 얻은 epitope binning 데이터를 파이썬으로 분석해서 어떤 항체 커뮤니티가 있는지 식별해보도록 하겠습니다.위의 결과를 통해 데이터의 형태를 파악할 수 있습니다. 총 2563개가 있고 최대값과 최소값을 보아하니 실제 실험 값이 아닌 일종의 후처리가된 값으로 구성되어 있음을 알 수 있습니다.히트맵은 차단, 비차단 및 불확실한 항체 쌍에 대한 빠른 개요를 제공합니다. 이를 통해 히트맵 내 데이터를 간편하게 검사할 수 있으며 다음과 같은 이점을 제공합니다:직관적 이해: 복잡한 데이터를 색상 코드로 표현하여 한눈에 파악할 수 있습니다.패턴 식별: 대량의 데이터에서 패턴이나 트렌드를 쉽게 발견할 수 있습니다.유연한 분석: 컷오프 값을 조정함으로써 다양한 조건에서 데이터를 분석할 수 있습니다.효율적인 데이터 해석: 많은 양의 정보를 압축된 형태로 표현하여 빠른 의사결정을 돕습니다.위 히트맵 결과를 통해 크게 4개의 클러스터가 존재하고 있다는 것을 쉽게 유추할 수 있습니다.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 클러스터링은 에피토프 빈닝 데이터를 분석하고 시각화하는 데 유용한 방법으로 히트맵보다 더 명료한 결과를 보여줍니다.위의 결과를 통해 총 4개의 항체의 클러스터를 확인 할 수 있었고 히트맵 결과와 유사함이 확인되었습니다.에피토프 빈닝은 항체의 결합 특성을 파악하고 다양한 에피토프를 표적으로 하는 항체를 선별할 수 있습니다. 히트맵과 KNN 클러스터링 등의 시각화 방법으로 항체 패널의 다양성을 확인하고 가장 유망한 후보를 선별하는 데 도움을 줍니다.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Observability Made Easy: Adding Logs, Traces &amp; Metrics to FastAPI with Logfire</title><link>https://dev.to/devgeetech/observability-made-easy-adding-logs-traces-metrics-to-fastapi-with-logfire-529l</link><author>Joel Gee Roy</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 20:44:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Picture this: You deploy your shiny new application. Everything looks great in dev, the logs are clean, requests are snappy, and life is good. Then… disaster strikes. A user reports a bug. Another complains about slow response times. You check your logs—wait, where are they? You SSH into the server, tail some logs, guess what went wrong, and hope for the best. Sound familiar?Observability—knowing what’s happening inside your app in real time—shouldn’t be this hard. But setting up an observability stack often feels like assembling IKEA furniture with missing instructions. That’s where  comes in.Pydantic Logfire is a platform that makes it ridiculously easy to add observability to your application, no matter the size. In this post, I’ll show you how to integrate Logfire into a  app to get instant insights into logs, traces, and metrics—without the usual setup headaches. By the end, you’ll have real-time visibility into what’s happening under the hood, so you can debug, optimize, and sleep better at night.We will build two services that handles orders and shipping for BigHuge Corp Inc. To keep things straightforward, we'll put both the services in the same repo and run a FastAPI for each of them to emulate two services talking to each other.fastapi-logfire
fastapi-logfire
We'll create a virtual environment and activate it:Let's install the necessary packages:pip  and  services
The ordering service will contain just two endpoints - one to place an order and one to get the details of a specific order. Similarly the shipping service will have two endpoints - one to initiate the shipping process and one to get the status of a shipment. The ordering service will invoke the shipping service in both its endpoints. 
Here's the code for both the services:Now we'll create  and  which will be used to start both the servicesYou can run both services on separate terminals using the  command.fastapi dev 8001 app/main2.py
You can go to  to try the ordering service out and see if everything is working as expected.Before we integrate logfire, you need to create a token from Logfire so that you can write data to the logfire dashboard.  You can read on how to generate the token here. Once you have the token, you can save it as an environment variable in a  file (You might need to install  to use it).We'll start small. We'll integrate logfire into our app such that all logs generated by the app will be sent to the logfire dashboard. We'll integrate logfire into the  standard library. (Tip: you can also emit logs directly using logfire methods like )We've defined a  function that we can call anywhere in our project to send logs.You can add similar statements in the  handler as well.In  and , we'll add the logic to configure logfireDo the same for , but with  as shipping.If you run both the apps again, and try out some requests, you will see some logs displaying on the Live tab of the logfire dashboad:Great! Now we see our logging statements in the dashboard. But Logfire lets us instrument fastapi directly to get even more data for each request. Let's implement that. Under the  in both  and , add a new line of code:Now all your requests to both servers are instrumented automatically.Now all the service level logs are neatly nested under the respective requests. But get this - it can get even better. So we set up our application in such a way the  endpoint will call  endpoint inside it. It would be really nice if our dashboard could display this sequential flow instead of showing both the calls as separate (like we saw before). We can do this using tracing. For tracing to work, context has to be propagated across services. This "context" helps keep track of the parent trace/span of a new span/log so that they can be viewed in tandem.  Thankfully logfire gives us an easy way to do this. Since we're using  to use the  service, we'll install the associated library from logfire.pip We'll update the code in  to add logfire.instrument_requests()We don't need to update  (the shipping one) because we aren't sending any requests in that server for now. will make sure that the traceparent header is automatically set when making requests.  makes sure that the  header is extracted correctly from incoming requests. Thats it. !Run the servers again, and try sending some requests. You'll see something like this in your logfire dashboard:And heavens forbid, if something were to go wrong in one of the services, you now know exactly where it went wrong. Let's test this out:If we try  now, we'll see something like this:Metrics signify how much of something exists. When paired with a time series, we can know the metric value at a point in time. This is useful for observing data like number of requests over a period of time, or things like CPU utilisation over time etc.Setting up system metric tracking is pretty straightforward with logfire, so we'll do that first.pip Now go to the logfire platform on your browser, select the "Dashboards" tab. Click on the "New Dashboard" button. Select "Basic System Metrics (Logfire)" from the drop down.Run the server again and you should be seeing the graph populate with your system data.if you choose "Web Server Metrics" from the create dashboard drop down, you'll get another readymade dashboard containing useful metrics from our services.Now let's add a custom metric to see the orders placed over time. We'll use a counter for this one.Now on the logfire platform, create a new dashboard and choose "Start from scratch" from the dropdown. Click on "Add Chart". We have to retrieve the data we need from logfire using SQL. To get an idea of how to structure your SQL queries, use the "Explore" tab in the logfire platform. To get the total orders placed in a time period we'll use the following query:Set the visualisation type as "Values" and save the chart. Now the chart will get updated based on the time period that you select on top.To chart this in a time series, use the following query:Choose the visualisation as "Time Series", and set the metrics to "scalar_value". In this post, we took a  to setting up observability in a FastAPI app using , covering logging, distributed tracing, and real-time metrics with minimal setup. While we focused on automatic instrumentation, there’s even more you can explore—like , which give you fine-grained control over spans and logs for deeper insights.

  1. Objeto Iterável (Iterable)
Um objeto iterável é qualquer objeto que pode ser percorrido em um loop for ou utilizado com a função . Em Python, para ser considerado iterável, um objeto deve implementar o método especial  ou o método .Exemplos comuns de objetos iteráveis incluem , , ,  e até arquivos.Exemplo de objeto iterável:Uma lista é um tipo de dado composto que pode armazenar uma coleção ordenada de itens. Ela é mutável, ou seja, pode ser alterada após sua criação. Pode armazenar elementos de diferentes tipos, como números, strings ou até outras listas.Em Python, "objeto" é um termo genérico que se refere a qualquer instância de uma classe. Tudo em Python é um objeto, e um objeto possui atributos e métodos definidos pela classe à qual pertence.Por exemplo, se você criar uma classe Pessoa, ao criar uma instância dessa classe (um objeto), ele terá atributos como nome e idade e poderá ter métodos como falar() ou andar().Em Python, o termo "Collection" (coleção) é uma forma genérica de se referir a tipos de dados que armazenam múltiplos itens. Isso inclui listas, tuplas, conjuntos (sets), dicionários, entre outros.As coleções são usadas para armazenar grupos de elementos e podem ser iteráveis, mutáveis ou imutáveis, dependendo do tipo. O módulo collections em Python também oferece tipos de dados especializados como deque e Counter.Exemplo de coleção (lista):Um iterador é um objeto que permite percorrer um objeto iterável, mas ao contrário do iterável, ele mantém o estado de onde está no percurso. Ou seja, um iterador sabe onde ele está no processo de iteração e pode continuar de onde parou.Um iterador implementa os métodos () (que retorna o próprio iterador) e () (que retorna o próximo item da coleção ou levanta uma exceção StopIteration quando não há mais itens).Quando não há mais elementos, o next(iterador) levanta uma exceção StopIteration. Qualquer objeto que pode ser percorrido em um loop (como listas ou tuplas). Um tipo de coleção que armazena elementos ordenados e mutáveis. Qualquer instância de uma classe em Python, com atributos e métodos. Estruturas que armazenam múltiplos itens (listas, tuplas, sets, dicionários).

For newcomers, Dynamic Programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.Let's see how the dynamic programming concept applies to Dynamic Data Tables, which is the solution we're trying to achieve in this article. Data Tables represent a structured way of organizing and displaying data in rows and columns with built-in functionality for managing large datasets. Think of it as an enhanced table that provides:Breaking down large datasets into smaller, manageable pagesAllows users to navigate through data without loading everything at onceTypically shows X records per page (e.g., 10, 25, 50 entries)Rows represent individual recordsColumns represent attributes or fieldsHeaders define the structure and can enable sortingSuitable for small datasetsAll records are pulled once on the client sideData is processed locally in the browser or phone applicationDatabase queries fetch only the required recordsReduces memory usage and improves performanceHandles large datasets efficientlyThe goal of our research is to provide the above features out of the box using a minimal configuration and only the dynamic features of Python that can detect and manipulate data at runtime. Let's break down the task into smaller pieces and start applying the dynamic programming principles to our specific use case. Users should be able to activate the dynamic pattern for any model using a simple and intuitive syntax. For this, we can use a map that uses the URL as the key, and the target model as value.The above definition will use the routing "products" to build the dynamic table for the Product Model defined in the apps/models.pyThe path for the model is now used to load the model class and analyze the fields and the type. The model can be analyzed using the  and  helpers as showcased below:If we call the  with the  input, we should get the  returned by the  helper.Having the class is the first step. Next is to get all fields, the associated types, and also all the foreign keys mapped to external types we don't know yet.   The ordinary fields can be pulled from the class definition using this code:The above snippet will return all fields defined using ordinary types like Integer, String, DateTime, and Text. For the Foreign key discovery, the code needs to use the model metadata that saves the distant relationships with other Models. The code that provides all associated FKs is the one below:After solving the FKs case, the next challenge is to detect the ENUMS used by the model for mapping the information into combos. Without this detection, the ENUMS will be mapped to input fields and we might have issues during creation or update.The above code snippet iterates on the model fields and saves all values for each field detected as ENUM. At this point, we've achieved the following:The model is automatically discovered using the URI segment and the configuration mappingFields information (name and type) covers all cases: simple types, ENUMS, foreign keysThe information is injected into the Jinja files to be presented to the userThe page provided by the dynamic data table provides the usual controls like search, show hide columns control, filters and export in CSV format.The item creation page is displayed with as below:For more inputs regarding the concept feel free to contact the team in support or simply download and inspect the code in your local system:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>COMMON MANUAL TESTING TECHNIQUES</title><link>https://dev.to/saikiran_r_63247e3b241a8e/common-manual-testing-techniques-1ngh</link><author>SAIKIRAN R</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 16:04:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi everyone we will look at the common manual testing techniquesThe client will approach the service provider with some requirements and a plan. Based on that plan, the frontend and backend development teams will work on creating the screens. After development, the testing team will begin testing the process to ensure it functions smoothly and meets the client’s requirements.
  
  
  What are the types of testing
There are 2 types of testingManual testing is the process of manually checking and verifying the functionality of software by using keyboard, mouse and some testing toolsIn business or in a career, there are process steps to follow to achieve success similarly in testing there are different types of testing to followed based on the scenarioLet me give you a simple example to explain Boundary Value Analysis:Imagine you're at a theme park, and there's a roller coaster ride. In the ticket section, there's a condition: the minimum age to get a ticket is 18, and the maximum age is 50.In this case, the system should not allow a ticket to be issued to anyone under 18 (age ≥ 18) or anyone over 50 (age ≤ 50).
Boundary Value Analysis involves testing the input values at the edges of the allowable range (i.e., at the boundaries), as these are the most likely to cause errors.Testing the input values at the allowable range is called boundary value analysis testing.In a login page, the user is required to input a username and password. The client’s requirement is that if the user enters the wrong password three times, the user should be blocked.To test this, we will create a table to test different scenarios, such as entering an invalid username or an invalid password. This helps to ensure that the system behaves correctly in all possible situations.
  
  
  Common manual testing techniques
To test the software’s performance under different network conditions.
This ensures the system can handle varying loads, network speeds, and other factors that could affect its performance.To explore the software and verify that all buttons, features, and functions are working correctly before proceeding to the next testing phase.
In exploratory testing, testers interact with the software to identify defects, without following a predefined set of test cases.Unit testing is done by developers to test individual components or functions of the software.
It ensures that each part of the code works as intended before the software is handed off to the testing team. Sometimes, the testing team may also perform unit testing.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Wk 3 Orchestration: MLOPs with DataTalks</title><link>https://dev.to/afrologicinsect/wk-3-orchestration-mlops-with-datatalks-2057</link><author>Akan</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 15:00:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We've been introduced to the subject of Machine Learning in Operations, familarized with Experiment Tracking with MLflow in the past week, now we work with orchestration tools, where we can manage all our processes all the way to deployment of the models - think CI/CD..

1.2 What's the version of Mage we run?
We will get this from the page's ui, still, hold on.Question 2. Creating a project
2.1 Create Project Name
Create a new project called "homework_03" - How many lines are in the created metadata.yaml file?Yes, so there are many ways to create a project but since we are yet to launch the servers, let's make this by simply tweaking the  variable in the  file - like so:
2.2 Launch Server: Starts up all the services defined in the  file using Docker Compose. This will build and run the containers necessary for the project.We should start to receive some logs indicating that the server is up on , visit the page and we would have version :And two new folders storing these actions:
2.3 Lines in metadata
To get the number of lines in the  file simply run:wc -l homework_03/metadata.yaml => 55 homework_03/metadata.yamlQuestion 3. Creating a pipeline
3.1 Create Standard Pipeline
Click on the Pipeline Icon, start a new  Pipeline and fill out the details.3.2 Load/Ingest Data takes us to this page:
Select  > Python > API, fill out the required details.We've created our first block! It gets fun from here. We can see some default ingestion code in our block - which we would modify into the this:import io

Register the model
Here, we would have to make some configurations to the  file to enable us connect to the MLflow servers - follow the next steps:6.1 Stop server
Ctrl + C or :Container mage-quickstart-magic-1  Stopping6.2 Create Dockerfile for MLflow:FROM python:3.10-slim

RUN pip install mlflow==2.12.1

EXPOSE 5000

CMD [ \
    "mlflow", "server", \
    "--backend-store-uri", "sqlite:///home/mlflow/mlflow.db", \
    "--default-artifact-root, ./artifacts", \
    "--host", "0.0.0.0", \
    "--port", "5000" \
]
6.2.2 Modify docker-compose yaml
As seen on the homework open the  file and make the changes, the file should now look like this:version: '3'
services:
  magic:
    image: mageai/mageai:latest
    command: mage start ${PROJECT_NAME}
    env_file:
      - .env

6.2.3 Run 
This will start up the server and set-up your new requirements - it might take a while to complete, check that both MLflow and Mage are running. NB. For the Author mlflow worked only on  and not on .6.3 Data Explorer
Create a Generic  and we pull the generated model and vectorizer from the previous  and like the assignment requires push the results to mlflow.Paste the following in your exporter block:import os

To make this possible, we need a REST API to handle book data efficiently.REST APIs are the backbone of modern web applications, enabling seamless communication between frontend and backend systems. Django REST Framework (DRF) simplifies API development by providing a powerful toolkit built on top of Django. In this guide, we'll build a simple REST API to manage books.Before starting this tutorial, you should have:✅ Basic understanding of Python programming
✅ Familiarity with web development concepts
✅ Python 3.8+ installed on your system
✅ Basic knowledge of the Django framework
✅ Understanding of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
✅ Experience using the command-line interfaceBy the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:✅ Set up a Django REST Framework project from scratch
✅ Create API endpoints using function-based views (FBVs) and class-based views (CBVs)
✅ Implement model serialization for JSON responses
✅ Perform CRUD operations via a REST API
✅ Test API endpoints using browsable API and cURL commands
  
  
  Why Django REST Framework?
Django REST Framework has become the go-to choice for building APIs with Django because it offers:✔️ Powerful serialization capabilities
✔️ Built-in authentication and permissions
✔️ Browsable API interface for easy testing
✔️ Extensive documentation and strong community support
✔️ Flexible request/response handling
✔️ Support for pagination, filtering, and throttlingLet’s start building our REST API step by step.Step 1: Environment SetupFirst, create a clean development environment:# Create a project folder
mkdir book-api && cd book-api

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate the virtual environment (Mac/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Django and Django REST Framework
pip install django djangorestframework

Now, create a Django project and an app for managing books.# Create a Django project
django-admin startproject bookapi

cd bookapi

# Create a Django app
python manage.py startapp books

Register Django REST Framework and the books app in settings.py:INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',

    # Third-party apps
    'rest_framework',

    # Local apps
    'books',
]

Define a Book model in books/models.py:from django.db import models

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    published_date = models.DateField()
    isbn = models.CharField(max_length=13, unique=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
python manage.py makemigrations books
python manage.py migrate
Step 5: Serializer CreationCreate books/serializers.py to handle data conversion:from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Book

class BookSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Book
        fields = '__all__'
We'll implement both function-based views (FBVs) and class-based views (CBVs).Function-Based Views (FBVs)from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view
from .models import Book
from .serializers import BookSerializer

@api_view(['GET'])
def book_list(request):
    books = Book.objects.all()
    serializer = BookSerializer(books, many=True)
    return Response(serializer.data)

@api_view(['POST'])
def book_create(request):
    serializer = BookSerializer(data=request.data)
    if serializer.is_valid():
        serializer.save()
        return Response(serializer.data, status=201)
    return Response(serializer.errors, status=400)


For a more scalable approach, use Django REST Framework’s generic views:from rest_framework import generics
from .models import Book
from .serializers import BookSerializer

class BookListCreateView(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
    queryset = Book.objects.all()
    serializer_class = BookSerializer

Step 7: URL Configurationfrom django.urls import path
from .views import book_list, book_create, BookListCreateView

urlpatterns = [
    # Function-based views
    path('books/', book_list, name='book-list'),
    path('books/create/', book_create, name='book-create'),

    # Class-based views
    path('books/cbv/', BookListCreateView.as_view(), name='book-list-cbv'),
]

**Update bookapi/urls.py:from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('api/', include('books.urls')),
]

Run the server and visit:📌 http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/Django REST Framework provides an interactive browsable API that allows you to test endpoints without external tools!You can also test the API using cURL commands:# GET request
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/

# POST request
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/create/ \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"title": "Django for Beginners", "author": "William Vincent", "published_date": "2021-09-01", "isbn": "9781735467207"}'
Next Steps: Enhancing Your APINow that you have a working API, consider improving it with:
✔️ Authentication & Permissions (e.g., only authenticated users can add books)
✔️ Pagination for Large Datasets
✔️ Filtering & Searching
✔️ ViewSets & Routers for cleaner URL management🎉 Congratulations! You have successfully built a simple REST API using the Django REST Framework. This foundation can be expanded to develop more complex APIs with additional features and security measures.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>RandomAffine in PyTorch (6)</title><link>https://dev.to/hyperkai/randomaffine-in-pytorch-6-4813</link><author>Super Kai (Kazuya Ito)</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 05:11:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[RandomAffine() can do random rotation or random affine transformation for an image as shown below:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>RandomAffine in PyTorch (5)</title><link>https://dev.to/hyperkai/randomaffine-in-pytorch-5-1c2m</link><author>Super Kai (Kazuya Ito)</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 03:59:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[RandomAffine() can do random rotation or random affine transformation for an image as shown below:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Seamlessly Compare Maps on QGIS with the QMapCompare Plugin</title><link>https://dev.to/mierune/seamlessly-compare-maps-on-qgis-with-the-qmapcompare-plugin-3186</link><author>Raymond Lay</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 02:10:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When working with QGIS, you often switch between basemaps, but  comparing small differences between maps can be challenging when only one map can be displayed at a time.However, QGIS has lacked a stable feature for map comparison until now! This post introduces , a new plugin that enables users to compare multiple maps directly within QGIS using various visualization methods.QMapCompare overview. Created by editing GSI TilesFirst, ensure you are using QGIS version 3.34 or later.
Then, you can install plugin by searching  on QGIS plugin manager.Once plugin installed, a new icon will appear on the toolbar.
Clicking the icon will toggle the QMapCompare panel on the left bottom of QGIS window.QMapCompare provides several ways to compare maps. Select layers you want to compare (1), and choose the following comparison method (2-5):1.  (multiple selections allowed)2. : Displays two maps side by side3. : Divides the map vertically4. : Divides the map horizontally5. : Check compare layers with a circle around the mouse cursor6. : Ends the comparison
  
  
  Comparison Methods Overview
The mirror mode places a duplicate of the map canvas on the right side of the map canvas. This is useful when comparing base maps with satellite imagery or other data.The split mode divides the map into two sections, showing different layers side by side.You can choose either a vertical or horizontal split, depending on your needs.This is may be useful for comparing building accuracy in OpenStreetMap with government-provided data as example.Lens mode displays a circular preview of the comparison layers around the mouse cursor.As you move the cursor, the preview updates in real time.This is especially useful for detailed comparisons of specific locations.QMapCompare is valuable for various use cases as below:Comparing historical aerial photographsTokyo Aerial Photo Comparison between 2024(left) and 1987-1990(right).GSI TilesAnalyzing pre- and post-disaster imagesAerial Photo Comparison of Before 2021 Atami Landslip Disaster (left) and after(right).GSI TilesQMapCompare is a powerful tool for comparing different maps and datasets within QGIS. With this plugin, you can easily:Analyze time-series data (e.g., pre- and post-disaster maps)Evaluate data accuracy (e.g., comparing OpenStreetMap with government maps)Support decision-making (e.g., verifying different analytical results and styles)As this is a newly released plugin, there may still be some bugs.

This is where Python's Virtual Environments package comes in handy.Use this post as a guide or a cheat sheet for future reference.
  
  
  Creating a Virtual Environment
To create a new virtual environment, use the following command:The .venv directory will contain your virtual environment. Using a dot (.) before the name makes it a hidden folder, which is a common practice. However, you can name it anything you like to suit your project structure.
  
  
  Activating the Virtual Environment
To activate the virtual environment, run:source .venv/bin/activate
Once activated, you can install any required packages and libraries. These installations will be isolated within the .venv directory and will not affect global Python packages.For example, to install pandas:
  
  
  Deactivating the Virtual Environment
To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:
  
  
  Listing Installed Packages
While the virtual environment is activated, you can list all installed packages using:The only difference between each command is that  will display a human-readable list while  will outputs installed packages in a machine-readable format.
  
  
  Sharing Your Virtual Environment
If you need to share your project, ensure that others can replicate your environment. You can do this by exporting the installed packages to a requirements.txt file:Save your venv into a .txtpip freeze > requirements.txt
If you receive a requirements.txt file from a colleague or friend, you can install all required packages by running:Import the packages from a requirements.txtpip install -r requirements.txt
By following these steps, you can effectively manage your Python environments and ensure consistency across different projects.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>RandomAffine in PyTorch (2)</title><link>https://dev.to/hyperkai/randomaffine-in-pytorch-2-3d3a</link><author>Super Kai (Kazuya Ito)</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 22:07:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[RandomAffine() can do random rotation or random affine transformation for an image as shown below:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>RandomAffine in PyTorch (1)</title><link>https://dev.to/hyperkai/randomaffine-in-pytorch-1-2j6j</link><author>Super Kai (Kazuya Ito)</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 22:03:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[RandomAffine() can do random rotation or random affine transformation for an image as shown below:The 1st argument for initialization is (Required-Type:,  or /( or )):

So, I thought—why not build an AI (agent type program) that does the boring stuff.It all started when I was working on a project and constantly had to review my own code. While AI-powered coding assistants like GitHub Copilot help with writing code, I wondered, why isn’t there an AI to review my code? That’s when I decided to build one. So yeah, AI-powered code review isn’t just a convenience—it’s a lifesaver.Create a command-line tool where I can input a code snippet.Use OpenAI’s GPT-4 to analyze and review the code.(If you don’t know where to find your secret API key: .Return a detailed review with suggestions, best practices, and potential bug fixes.After some research, I decided on the following stack: Python (Standalone CLI tool) OpenAI’s GPT-4 API Terminal-based command-line applicationYou can subscribe to   for more such cool AI prompts.
  
  
  Here’s your premium prompt:
Please generate a Python script for a terminal-based AI code reviewer application that uses OpenAI's GPT model.

While the documentation is comprehensive, it can be overwhelming to navigate, especially when you're trying to build advanced AI agents.This guide is my attempt to consolidate the key concepts and practical implementations of LangGraph in one place. Whether you're building a conversational agent that needs to remember context, a multi-step reasoning agent, or a complex workflow that coordinates multiple AI components, LangGraph provides the framework to make it happen. I created this reference for myself but I hope it helps others who want a more straightforward explanation of how to use LangGraph effectively.LangGraph is a framework that brings state machines to Large Language Model (LLM) applications. It's particularly useful when you need to build complex, stateful applications with LLMs. The framework allows you to structure your application as a graph, where each node represents a specific task or state, and edges represent transitions between states.Let's start with a simple example to understand the core concepts: we are developing a simple agent that collects information and  processes it, the actions  of collecting and processing information are just fixed actions but they can be replaced with more complex actions.This example shows the basic structure of a LangGraph application:Define your state using TypedDict, it contains the information that the workflow will need to keep track of.Create functions for each state, these functions are the actions that the workflow will perform.Build a graph with nodes and edges, the nodes are the states and the edges are the transitions between them.Compile the graph into a runnable application, this will create a callable object that can be invoked with an initial state.I also added a simple way to save the graph visualization as a PNG file, this will work if you are running this example locally and should save a file that will show the graph structure like below.The graph is a good way to understand the workflow, it shows the nodes and the edges between them, the entry and finish points and the state of the workflow.This particular example is not very useful but it shows the core concepts of LangGraph, you can simply replace the fixed actions with more complex ones and build a useful agent.
  
  
  Serving LangGraph as a Web Service
While LangGraph itself doesn't include built-in server capabilities, you can easily create a web service using FastAPI to serve your LangGraph workflows. Below I have modified the previous example to add a simple FastAPI server that allows you to run the workflow from a web interface.You can run this locally or using the Hugging Face space below, this is the URL to access the swagger API for this example https://jstoppa-langgraph-basic-example-api.hf.space/docs, the API has an end point to run the agent and it returns the messages we've seen in our previous example (see below the results). In simple words, the API has an end point to run the agent and it returns the messages we've seen in our previous example.
  
  
  Making it all work with a more interesting example
We are now going to create a more interesting example, an AI agent that does code reviews, this is far from a production-ready agent but it will give us a better understanding of how to use LangGraph.The screenshot below shows the interface for the code review agent, the user can enter a code and the agent will return a report with the code analysis. This interface uses the Gradio library to create a simple web interface, this saves a lot of time compared to building a full web app.The full code is provided after this but the most impportant part of the example is the graph, it shows the nodes and the edges between them, the entry and finish points and the state of the workflow, this is how the graph will look through the code and analyse the code with different agents that are especialised on different aspects. This is a very similar apporach we've seen in the previous example but it contains more actions and the actions do use LLMs to analyse the code.the full code for the agent is below and it can also be found in Hugging Face below.LangGraph makes it easier to build AI agents that need to manage complex workflows. The graph-based approach keeps things organised and flexible, especially when dealing with multi-step processes or memory.Even though LangGraph doesn’t come with built-in server features, it works well with FastAPI and other frameworks to serve agents as APIs. Whether you’re building a chatbot, a code reviewer, or something else entirely, it gives you a solid foundation to work with.I’m still experimenting and learning, so I’ll keep updating this post as I find better ways to use LangGraph.

While OpenAI’s GPT models are widely used, many developers want to understand how these models work and even train their own versions from scratch. In this in-depth guide, we will explore how to build a lightweight LLM using Python, train it on Hacker News data, optimize its performance, and deploy it for real-world usage.
  
  
  What is a Language Model?
A Language Model (LM) is a type of artificial intelligence model that predicts the likelihood of a sequence of words in a given language. It learns patterns, grammar, and context from a large corpus of text data, enabling it to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. For example, given the phrase "I love to code in," an LM might predict "Python" as the next word, based on patterns observed in its training data.LMs are used in various applications, including:Text generation: Creating articles, stories, or dialogues.Machine translation: Translating text from one language to another.Text classification: Sentiment analysis or spam detection.Autocomplete: Suggesting words or phrases in search engines or text editors.In this article, we'll focus on building a simple autoregressive LM that predicts the next word in a sequence, trained specifically on HackerNews data.Understanding how LLMs workCollecting and preprocessing Hacker News dataTokenizing text and creating structured datasetsTraining a transformer-based model using PyTorch and Hugging Face TransformersFine-tuning and optimizing for better performanceEvaluating model performance using loss metrics and perplexityDeploying the model with FastAPI and making it accessible via an APIImproving the model with reinforcement learning and knowledge distillationScaling the model with distributed trainingReducing computational costs through quantization and pruningEnhancing model security with adversarial trainingBefore we start, install the necessary dependencies:pip torch transformers datasets tokenizers accelerate fastapi uvicorn matplotlib deepspeed bitsandbytes
 for deep learning computations for leveraging pre-built architectures like GPT-2 for handling large text corpora efficiently for high-speed text processing and  for deploying the model as an API for visualizing loss curves and performance metrics for optimizing large-scale model training for quantization to reduce memory footprint
  
  
  Step 1: Understanding Large Language Models
Before diving into code, it's essential to grasp how LLMs function. At their core, these models are neural networks trained to predict the next word in a sequence given an input context. They use: to break text into numerical representationsTransformer architectures (such as GPT-2) with attention mechanisms to understand long-range dependencies to train on vast amounts of unstructured text data to adapt to specific tasks, such as chatbots or code generation
  
  
  Step 2: Collecting Hacker News Data

  
  
  Step 3: Preprocessing and Tokenization
Data cleaning ensures better training results. We remove HTML tags, non-text characters, and normalize text.Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units, called tokens, which can be words, subwords or even characters. This step is critical to transforming text into a numerical representation that deep learning models can understand and process.
  
  
  Step 4: Creating a Dataset and DataLoader
We format our text for training using PyTorch’s  class.
  
  
  Step 5: Training the Transformer Model
We fine-tune a pre-trained GPT-2 model on our dataset.
  
  
  Step 6: Model Optimization
Model optimization focuses on improving the efficiency of a trained model by reducing its memory usage and increasing its inference speed. Two key techniques used for optimization are:Quantization reduces the precision of model parameters (e.g., converting 32-bit floating point numbers to 8-bit integers). This helps decrease memory consumption and speeds up inference, especially on resource-limited devices.
In the code, we achieve this using BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_8bit=True), which loads the GPT-2 model in an 8-bit format, reducing its size and computational requirements.Pruning removes unnecessary parameters from the model, reducing the number of computations required during inference. While pruning is not explicitly implemented in the code, it can be done by eliminating less significant weights from the neural network.
  
  
  Step 7: Deploying as an API
We use FastAPI to make our model accessible.We have successfully built, trained, optimized, and deployed a custom LLM using Hacker News data. Future improvements could involve:Training on a larger datasetOptimizing hyperparametersImplementing reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)Deploying in a production-grade environmentEnhancing security against adversarial attacks]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>This Week In Python</title><link>https://dev.to/bascodes/this-week-in-python-1gc6</link><author>Bas Steins</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 16:24:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This Week in Python is a concise reading list about what happened in the past week in the Python universe.kreuzberg – A text extraction library supporting PDFs, images, office documents and moregpt-from-scratch – Educational implementation of a small GPT model from scratch in a single Jupyter Notebookopendrop – An open Apple AirDrop implementation written in Python]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>RandomRotation in PyTorch</title><link>https://dev.to/hyperkai/randomrotation-in-pytorch-58g</link><author>Super Kai (Kazuya Ito)</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 15:25:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The 1st argument for initialization is (Required-Type:,  or /( or )):

Let's dive in! You can check out my GitHub for the complete code.First, we'll define the Terraform version and set up the backend to store the state in an S3 bucket. Since Terraform doesn't create the backend bucket automatically, you'll need to provision it beforehand. Variables cannot be used in the backend configuration so the values to be hardcoded but feel free to change them.We'll also create a few local variablesNow we'll define the configuration to provision the DynamoDB table. DynamoDB tables require a , a ,which should also specified as an attribute, and a .Next, we'll provision the output S3 bucket by specifying a name using either the  or  field. To manage storage efficiently, we'll add a lifecycle configuration that automatically deletes files after one day. Lifecycle configurations require the bucket name and at least one rule to define the retention policy.We'll start by assigning the AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole, which grants essential permissions like creating CloudWatch logs.To package the Python scripts for the Translate Text and Translate File endpoints, we'll use the  data resource. Since the Translate File API has dependencies, we'll install them beforehand using a  before packaging.We'll also create an IAM role for the Lambda functions and attach the necessary policies. Finally, we'll define the Lambda functions using the packaged files, set the handler to , and configure the required environment variables.Finally, we'll define the API Gateway API. To handle file uploads properly, we'll include  in the  configuration, ensuring that multipart requests are base64-encoded before being sent to the Lambda function.  Additionally, we'll configure the API resources as deployment triggers, so any changes to their properties automatically trigger a new deployment.We'll also define a few outputs.To provision the infrastructure, we first configure the AWS CLI with our credentials:Next, we initialize Terraform and apply the configuration:terraform init
terraform apply
After successful provisioning, we can access the API via the output url.To wrap up this series, we've walked through writing python code for lambda functions and provisioning a complete infrastructure using Terraform and AWS. 
If you've followed along, you should now have an API that can translate text and files running on AWS. But this is just the beginning! There’s always more to explore—whether it’s optimizing performance, integrating monitoring tools, or adding a CI/CD pipeline.I’d love to hear your thoughts!

I'm Shrijith Venkatrama, founder of Hexmos. Right now, I’m building LiveAPI, a tool that makes generating API docs from your code ridiculously easy.
  
  
  Replicating The micrograd Program in PyTorch
In PyTorch we can replicate our micrograd expression using the following code. Here instead of the  class we use the  class.The output is -- which agrees with the output from the previous post:0.7071066904050358
----
x2 0.5000001283844369
w2 0.0
x1 -1.5000003851533106
w1 1.0000002567688737
In a typical real-world project, instead of scalars, we'd use larger tensors.For instance, we can define a 2x3 tensor as follows:tensor([[1., 2., 3.],
        [4., 5., 6.]])
By default, PyTorch stores number as , so we convert them to  as expected:Also, in PyTorch by default nodes are not expected to require gradients. This is for efficiency reasons - for example, we do not require gradients in leaf nodes.For nodes that require gradients, we must explicitly enable it:
  
  
  Start Building Neural Networks on the  Class
The goal is to build a two layer MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron).In the above code  will generate a random number between -1 and 1. And  is the number of inputs. So if we want say 10 inputs to our Neuron, then we will set .For reference, this is the diagram for a neuron:
  
  
  The  Mechanism In Python Classes
We have a  mechanism, which can be used to use the objects of type Neuron  though they were functions.
  
  
  Implementing  on a neuron
I get an output like this:Value(data=-0.6963855451596829, grad=0, label='')
As of now, on every run the value received will be different - since we are initializing with random inputs during initialization.
  
  
  Defining a Layer of Neurons
The code for defining a layer of neurons is as follows:For a layer - we need to take in the number of inputs and number of outputs, and we simply create a list of Neuron objects first.When the Layer is called, we just call each neuron object with the given input values.The above code gives a result like this:[Value(data=0.8813774949215492, grad=0, label=''),
 Value(data=0.9418974314812039, grad=0, label=''),

Whether you log into a website, check the weather on your phone, or order food online, you're likely interacting with a RESTful API in the background.But what exactly is a RESTful API? In this guide, we'll break it down in a simple and digestible way.
  
  
  What Does "RESTful" Even Mean?
Let’s start with the basics.An API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for different software applications to communicate with each other. Think of it like a waiter in a restaurant:You (the client) place an order.The waiter (API) takes your request to the kitchen (server).The kitchen prepares the food and the waiter brings it back to you.In technical terms, an API allows a client (e.g., a web app or mobile app) to request and receive data from a server.So, What Are RESTful APIs??REST stands for Representational State Transfer—don’t worry, it’s not as complicated as it sounds! It’s just a set of instructions for how computers and apps should share info over the internet. Think of it like a simple rulebook for keeping their conversations clear and organized.A RESTful API is an API that follows these REST rules. It’s like calling a café “specialty” because it makes coffee in a certain way. RESTful APIs have their principles which APIs must follow to qualify as "RESTFUL APIs".
  
  
  What Makes an API 'RESTful'
For an API to be RESTful, it must follow these principles:Client-Server Architecture – The client (e.g., a mobile app) and server (e.g., a database) remain separate so they can evolve independently.Statelessness – The server does not store client data between requests. Every request contains all the necessary information.Cacheability – Responses can be cached to improve performance.Uniform Interface – Consistent resource naming and use of HTTP methods.Layered System – Requests can pass through intermediaries (e.g., load balancers) without affecting how they function.RESTful APIs rely on standard HTTP methods to perform actions on resources. Imagine an online payslip system:: (Get payslip with ID 123) (Add a new payslip) (Update payslip with ID 123) (Delete payslip with ID 123)Example API Request (Python)Here’s a simple Python example using the requests library to fetch a payslip:import requests

response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/payslips/123")
if response.status_code == 200:
    print(response.json())
else:
    print("Error fetching data")
This request retrieves a payslip from the API and prints the JSON response.
  
  
  RESTful APIs vs. Other API Styles
REST: Uses lightweight JSON or XML over HTTP.SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol): More complex, uses XML, and requires additional protocols like WS-Security.REST: Fixed endpoints (/users, /orders).GraphQL: Allows flexible queries, fetching only necessary data
  
  
  Authentication in RESTful APIs
APIs often require authentication to protect sensitive data. Common methods include:API Keys – Unique keys assigned to users.OAuth 2.0 – Secure authorization protocol used by platforms like Google and GitHub.JWT (JSON Web Tokens) – Tokens used for secure authentication between client and server.Example authentication using a Bearer Token:headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"}
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/payslips/123", headers=headers)
print(response.json())
RESTful APIs are a clever and organized way for apps and computers to share stuff over the internet. They use simple ideas like resources (think of them as items they’re working with), HTTP methods (like “get” or “send”), and web addresses (called URIs), plus some cool tricks like not remembering past chats (statelessness) and saving info for later (caching). All of this keeps things fast and smooth. Whether you’re creating payslips or playing music on an app, RESTful APIs are quietly making it happen every day.Next time you’re using an app, think about the RESTful magic working behind the scenes—it’s pretty awesome! If you’re curious, try playing with a free API (like a weather API—it’s a fun way to start!).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Talk Python to Me: #494: Update on Flet: Python + Flutter UIs</title><link>https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/494/update-on-flet-python-flutter-uis</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As Python developers, we're incredibly lucky to have over half a million packages that we can use to build our applications with over at PyPI. However, when it comes to choosing a UI framework, the options get narrowed down very quickly. Intersect those choices with the ones that work on mobile, and you have a very short list. Flutter is a UI framework for building desktop and mobile applications, and is in fact the one that we used to build the Talk Python courses app, you'd find at <a href="https://talkpython.fm/apps">talkpython.fm/apps</a>. That's why I'm so excited about Flet. Flet is a Python UI framework that is distributed and executed on the Flutter framework, making it possible to build mobile apps and desktop apps with Python.

Although Google Assistant are better at handling speech to text problem, it has the same limitations as above.I decided to go big this time and build my own Telegram chat bot.  Every time you send a voice, it will process it automatically:Breaking down the text into multiple tasks.Set due date, reminder date, important level based on my personal information.Very convenient.  But the biggest drawback is that I still need to send voice to the app manually, not "Hi Bixby" or "Hey Google", this makes it lose its practicality.  I will find a way to fix this in the futureTo do list is integrated into this tele bot:I used Faiss as vector database and Langchain to get text from any sources I could think of (.pdf, .doc, .ppt, .txt, .md, .epub, link, ebook, youtube...).  If you ask Chatgpt, it will sometime mislead you or create fake answer. Although the answer might be correct, it doesn't follow the lecturer's documents. This RAG system take the answer from our documents to produce results, so the results are more accurate and we can immediately check its correctness.  I also tested on the Software Testing Quizz, the result was about 7/10.  I also ask chatgpt, but the answer seems bad.But Questions with the answer "All the answers are correct" are often wrong.  Perhaps it's because the model only finds the answer with the highest probability, so the aggregated answers are not fit to this case. Maybe I should rewriting the prompt.  Additionally, a small part of the learning resources are images, and I'm actually still looking for ways to optimize the explanation for the images.I just wanna build my own LLM with RAGWelcome to the my LLM with RAG system! This system is designed for me the ease the learning as a master in HCMUT     curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/update

Before running the system, follow these steps to set up the environment:Close the Git repository to your local machine:
git clone [repository_url]Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages using the provided  file:To read  file we need to run this code  apt update
  apt install libreoffice 
During the pandemic, I realized that I'm best at  learning online courses.  I usually watch the video 2 or 3 times, fast forwarding unimportant parts (focusing on the 20% of the time that brings 80% of the value).  I plan to record all the lectures, then ask the model to synthesize and track which time period and what topic is being talked about... Or convert it to text format to save in the database for LLM + RAG systemI am convinced that individuals adept at utilizing LLMs can elevate their performance by up to 200%. To stand out among others, it requires a combination of diligent effort and the right tools. Even a marginal improvement of 1% can contribute significantly to your success.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ElasticTransform in PyTorch (1)</title><link>https://dev.to/hyperkai/elastictransform-in-pytorch-1-56fc</link><author>Super Kai (Kazuya Ito)</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 01:04:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The 1st argument for initialization is (Optional-Default:-Type:,  or /( or )):

  2. Key Concepts to Understand in Ren'Py
Learning Ren'Py can seem overwhelming at first, but once you break it down, it’s not as difficult as it seems. Here are some essential concepts you’ll need to grasp to get started:Ren'Py’s scripting language is simple and intuitive. To create a scene, you’ll write commands that define the characters, backgrounds, and dialogue. For example:label start:
    scene bg room
    show char1 happy
    "Welcome to my visual novel!"
This basic script shows how easy it is to get started with Ren'Py. The syntax is straightforward, allowing you to focus on writing the story rather than wrestling with complex code.
  
  
  Creating Characters & Backgrounds
You’ll need to create character sprites and backgrounds to bring your story to life. Ren'Py makes it easy to display images and manage character emotions or poses:This line will show char1 with a sad expression. You can swap out different images, backgrounds, and even animate characters, adding life to your narrative.Choice Menus and Branching Narratives
One of Ren'Py’s strongest features is its ability to let players make choices that impact the story. With a simple menu command, you can create branching paths for the player to follow:menu:
    "Go left":
        jump left_path
    "Go right":
        jump right_path
This simple choice mechanic adds replayability and depth to your visual novel.Ren'Py offers a variety of transitions and visual effects, like fades, wipes, and custom animations. This is where you can start adding some flair to your visual novel, creating smooth scene changes or dramatic visual effects.For example, to fade out a scene, you can use:This creates a smoother transition between scenes, enhancing the overall experience.
  
  
  Interactivity & Minigames
You can also incorporate minigames into your visual novel, providing an interactive element beyond the traditional choices. For example, in my own project, I developed a puzzle mini-game, where players could engage with the game to unlock new parts of the story.
  
  
  3. Resources to Accelerate Your Learning
While Ren'Py is beginner-friendly, the best way to learn is by combining hands-on experience with structured learning. There are many great resources to help you along the way: The official Ren'Py Documentation is the best place to start. It covers everything from basic scripting to advanced features. The Ren'Py forums are filled with tips, tutorials, and code snippets from experienced developers.Tutorial Blogs and YouTube Channels: There are numerous free tutorials online, many of which provide step-by-step guides to help you create your first visual novel.If you’re looking for a more structured approach, I’ve created a comprehensive Udemy course titled Mastering Ren'Py: Create Visual Novels Like a Pro. In this course, I cover everything from the basics to advanced techniques like creating custom screens, implementing animations, and designing minigames. It's a one-stop resource for anyone serious about mastering Ren'Py.
  
  
  4. Common Mistakes Beginners Make (and How to Avoid Them)
Even the most experienced developers make mistakes, but the good news is that you can avoid common pitfalls by learning from others. Here are a few mistakes beginners often make and how to avoid them:Overcomplicating the Story: While it’s tempting to have a complex plot with endless branching, it’s better to start with a simple story. Focus on making each choice meaningful and impactful. It’s easy to get lost in a pile of code. Make sure to organize your scripts properly and comment on your code to avoid confusion later on. Testing is crucial. Playtest your visual novel frequently to catch bugs or awkward pacing before it’s too late.
  
  
  5. Tips for Creating an Engaging Visual Novel
Now that you understand the basics, here are a few tips to make your visual novel stand out:Great visual novels are driven by compelling stories. Develop deep, relatable characters and create an engaging narrative that keeps the player invested. The power of a visual novel lies in its ability to connect emotionally with players.Visual novels rely heavily on artwork and music to set the tone. Good visuals and sound can elevate your storytelling to new heights. Whether you're an artist or working with a team, make sure your assets complement your story.Once you have the basic structure of your visual novel, go back and refine it. Customize the user interface, add smooth transitions, and tweak the audio to create a more polished experience.

Essentially, it’s a mutex that ensures only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time, protecting internal data structures—especially the reference counting used by the garbage collector—from race conditions. .Excitingly, Python 3.13 is the first release featuring an experimental build mode that disables the GIL, opening the door to significant performance improvements for multi-threaded applications.Before discussing these new changes, let’s do a quick recap of the pros and cons of the GIL.The GIL offers several advantages, including:Simplified Memory Management: By blocking threads from concurrently modifying an object’s reference count, the GIL prevents race conditions and ensures the garbage collector doesn’t free an object while it’s still referenced, making the core implementation simpler and more robust.Ease of C Extension Integration: Many C libraries and extensions, which are not inherently thread-safe, can be used safely under the GIL’s protection.Single-thread Performance: Since CPython uses reference counting for memory management, the garbage collector has minimal impact compared to mark-and-sweep algorithms used in languages - ex: Java -, which can be unpredictable and cause pauses.But if only one thread can use the interpreter at a given time, how does Python run multiple threads?Thread switching is a complex topic; even the interpreter doesn’t always decide which thread runs next, as the operating system also influences scheduling. In this blog, we will focus solely on the Python side of thread management.
  
  
  what happens when a thread holds the GIL?
When a thread holds the GIL, it may encounter one of the following scenarios:If it reaches an I/O task, the thread willingly releases the lock while waiting, allowing other threads to run.During CPU-intensive operations, the lock is automatically released after a defined timeout (typically 5ms).Now that we understand how thread switching works, it’s clear that one of the main downsides of the GIL is limited true multi-threaded parallelism in CPU-bound programs. Removing the GIL requires a solution that grants safe, concurrent access to objects and memory management without compromising single-thread performance.Sam Gross, the author of PEP 703, has proposed an ingenious solution to remove the GIL from CPython while ensuring thread safety. The proposal rethinks CPython’s memory management and introduces three key techniques:Biased Reference Counting:
Many objects are primarily modified by a single thread, so biased reference counting lets that thread update an object’s reference count without atomic overhead. If another thread intervenes, the system safely falls back to slower, thread-safe operations—optimizing the common single-threaded case.Deferred Reference Counting:
For objects like top-level functions, code objects, modules, and methods that are accessed concurrently, deferred reference counting postpones immediate atomic updates. It batches reference count changes to reduce contention, thereby minimizing overhead for dynamic objects that aren’t immortal.:
Certain objects—such as interned strings, small integers, PyTypeObjects, and the True, False, and None—live for the duration of the program. These are marked as immortal (their reference count is set to UINT32_MAX), so Py_INCREF and Py_DECREF become no-ops, avoiding contention when accessed by multiple threads.Together, these techniques pave the way for enhanced parallelism and a more efficient, concurrent CPython.From the Steering Council’s notice about the adoption of PEP 703::
We will add the no-GIL build as an experimental build mode, presumably in Python 3.13 (if it slips to 3.14, that is not a problem). The build mode is experimental to clarify that, although the core developers support it, we cannot expect the community to adopt it immediately. We need time to determine the necessary changes in API design, packaging, and distribution, and we want to discourage distributors from shipping the experimental no-GIL build as the default interpreter.:
Once there is sufficient community support for production use of no-GIL, we will support the no-GIL build—but not as the default—while setting a target date or Python version for making it the default. This timing will depend on factors such as backward compatibility of API changes (e.g., the stable ABI) and the remaining work identified by the community. We expect this phase to take at least a year or two, possibly more. Some distributors may start shipping no-GIL by default, though this will vary with package support.:
Our goal is for no-GIL to become the default, eventually removing any vestiges of the GIL without unnecessarily breaking backward compatibility. We do not want to maintain two common build modes indefinitely, as this can double testing resources and debugging efforts. However, the transition cannot be rushed and may take as much as five years.The move to remove the GIL marks a major evolution in CPython’s design. By rethinking memory management with biased and deferred reference counting, plus immortal objects, PEP 703 offers a practical path to better multi-threaded performance without losing single-thread efficiency. As Python gradually shifts toward a no-GIL future, we can look forward to an interpreter that’s more capable on today’s multi-core systems.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>## Master Django Redirects in Under 3 Minutes 🚀</title><link>https://dev.to/ebereplenty/-master-django-redirects-in-under-3-minutes-4f6</link><author>NJOKU SAMSON EBERE</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 20:13:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Django provides a powerful way to redirect users from one page to another using the  function.

  The tome of wise practices
Some tips on improving code readability.Where the purpose, the author, and the date of creation are inscribedThe header, ahh.. the header. That little snippet of code at the top of the script is like a preamble, a clearing of the throat before the real business begins. What purpose does it serve? Well, the header is a kind of introduction, letting the reader know what's to come with some basic information.Let the Code be governed by a singular, mighty functionAh, the main() function - now there's a topic! It's like the heart and soul of your code, the place where everything comes together. See, when you're working on a code project, it's like you're building a big machine, right? And the main() function, well, that's the control panel, the place where you pull all the levers and push all the buttons to make the whole thing rock. In order to use that machine, you gotta follow a certain set of steps right? Turn the key, check the fuel, prime the pump.. Well, that's what the main() function is all about - it's the sequence of events that gets your code up and running.
  
  
  The parameters, guardians of function
Each one a gatekeeper, ensuring the proper flow of information.Parameters are those little vessels that carry the lifeblood of our functions.
Now, I know what you're thinkin' - "But George, how do I know which one to use?" Well, my friend, it all comes down to the task at hand.
If you're dealing with a relatively simple setup like here, them variables-as-parameters might be just the ticket you need. But if you're working on somethin' a little more complex, with all sorts of moving parts and interdependencies, well, them classes, they're the way to go. Classes, are the real MVPs of the bunch, and they will help keeping everything organized and running smooth as silk.
  
  
  The docstrings, the illuminating scrolls
Where the function's purpose, its workings, and its returns are documented.Alright, people, let me tell you about these things called docstrings. Now, I know what you're thinking - "Docstrings? What in the Sam Hill are those?" Let me break it down for you.
These docstrings, they're like little notes, little snippets of information that you tack on to your code, just to give folks a heads up on what's going on. It's like when you're doing some work around the house, and you leave a little note for the neighbour, just to let ‘em know what you're up to.
Now, these docstrings, they come in all shapes and sizes. But the way I see it, these docstrings, they're not just about the code, no sir. They're about the people too. So, when you write one of these things, you're not just explaining what the code does, you're telling a story. You're givin' people a little glimpse into your mind and your thought process. And this makes  difference because on bigger projects, we all know you will never code alone.
  
  
  Type hints as vigilant sentinels
Ensuring the integrity of the data.Listen up, I'm about to let you in on a little secret when it comes to this Python business. It's all about them type hints, they're guardrails that keep you from taking a wrong turn by telling your fellow programmers, "hey, this is what I'm expecting here, so don't go messing it up, y'hear?"
See, these type hints, they're some kind of guardians of your program, keeping a watchful eye to make sure you don't go trying to mix apples and oranges, so to speak. When you're dealing with a language as flexible as Python, that's a darn good thing to have in your corner. The more you use ‘em, the more you'll see just how powerful they can be.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Basic Selenium – The Easy Peasy Introduction, Chapter 3 of 3</title><link>https://dev.to/atomictangerline/basic-selenium-the-easy-peasy-introduction-chapter-3-of-3-3bb7</link><author>brk</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 15:28:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Automating web-based tasks with Selenium?

The sorcery of the selectorsVII. The bridge of translation is crossedVIII. The file is writtenThe Taming of the Firefox
  
  
  I. In the realm of the browser, a puppet is forged
Where the mighty browser is bound to our will, as if by sorcery.First up, we've got this  business. Now, I know what you're thinking - "George, what in the world is a driver service?" Well, let me tell you, it's the piece of code that's gonna make this whole Selenium thing work. It's like a bridge between our script and the middleman, I name the ! And after that service is up, the gecko’s gonna turn our Firefox into a nice .
And where do we get this driver service, you ask? From the , of course! That's the path to the executable that's gonna make Firefox dance to our tune. Do you know what else it's gonna do? It's gonna log everything that's happening, right into the  file. That way, if anything goes sideways, we can take a peek under the hood and see why’s that.
Now, the options. See, we're creating a shiny new set of , and we're gonna deck them out with some goodies. First up, we're pointing it to the , making sure we've got the right browser to work with.
And then, if that  variable is set to True, we're gonna add a little  argument to the mix. That means the browser's gonna run without a visible window, stealthier than your average ninja. No need for all the bells and whistles (and windows), we're just here to get the job done, right?
And finally, we're wrapping it all up by returning a brand-spankin' new instance of the , complete with our custom service and options. This one's like a well-oiled machine, and we're the ones behind the wheel.
Just remember: if you ever find yourself scratching your head, wondering what in the world is going on, just take a peek at that  file. It's like a crystal ball, and it might tell you everything you need to know.
  
  
  II. The opening of the file
Like an ancient tome unveiling its secrets.Alright, folks, gather 'round, because we're about to dive into some more of this code. Now, this right here, this is the kind of stuff that separates the wheat from the chaff.
First up, we've got this  block. Now, I know what you're thinking: "George, what in the world is a  block?" Well, let me tell you, it's the statement that’s gonna keep us from running headfirst into a brick wall every time something goes wrong. And trust me, in the universe of programming, something's always going wrong.
See, what we're doing here is we're trying to open a file, right? And we're using this fancy-schmancy  function to do it. And that's where the  block comes in.
If everything goes according to plan, and the file is there, waiting for us with open arms, we're gonna read the contents and hand 'em back, no problem.  "But George, what could possibly go wrong?" Well, my friends, the world is a cruel and unpredictable place ( when you’re learning software development), and sometimes, those files, they just up and disappear. But don't you worry, we've got a plan and that's where the  block comes in.
If that  rears its ugly head, we're gonna print out a nice, friendly message, letting the user know that the file they were looking for is.. not there..
It's like a safety net, a way to keep the wheels from falling off even when the road gets a little bumpy. And you know what they say, "the more you plan for the unexpected, the less unexpected it becomes." Or something like that.. I don't know, I'm just making it up as I go along.Anyway, the point is when life hands you lemons, you make lemonade. And when life hands you , you just smile ;)
  
  
  III. Sentence splitting action unleashed
The fellowship of words is broken.Okay, listen up, because we're about to dive into some serious sentence-splitting action.
Now, you might be looking at this line of code and thinking: "what in the world is going on here?" Well, let me tell you, it's a thing of beauty: we're taking this text that we've been handed, and we're gonna break it down into its individual sentences.
And how are we doing it, you ask? With the power of regular expressions () and its  implementation, that's how. "But George, what's a regular expression?" Well, my friends, it's a language all its own, a way of describing patterns in ways that would make your head spin. You can tinker with it here.
But don't worry, we're not gonna get too deep into the weeds here. All you need to know is that this little regular expression is the key to our success. It's gonna look for those periods, question marks, and exclamation marks, and it's gonna use them as the boundaries to split our text into individual sentences. But careful, this regex has its limits, see, every language is like a delicate little dance, with each word and phrase movin' in perfect harmony. Some Pros, they’re like aware of that more than us so they built up nice little tools using carefully crafted and more accurate natural language processing (NLP)  formulas (for example you can experiment with the nltk library). For the sake of simplicity, let’s stick to the basics with the regex way.The next time you find yourself staring at a wall of text, wondering how in the world you're gonna make sense of it all, just remember this little line of code and no more trying to figure out where one sentence ends and the next one begins. And who knows, maybe one day, you'll be the one writing the regular expressions turning chaos of strings into order.
  
  
  IV. The forging of the chunks
The awakening of mighty blocks of text.Hmm, we're about to dive into some serious text-chunking action now. You see, we've got this text that we need to translate, but we can't just send the whole thing off to the translation service all at once. Nah, that would be way too easy. Instead, we've gotta break it down into manageable chunks, little bite-sized pieces that the service can handle without breaking a sweat. That's where this  function comes in handy. It's like a master chef, carefully slicing and dicing the text, making sure each piece is the perfect size.
First, we set up a little , a fancy data structure that's gonna help us keeping track of the current chunk.A , that's just a  way of saying double-ended queue, obviously we deal with small amounts of data here but I wanted to give a try to this exotic thing. Your less sophisticated arrays would work fine there too. Just remember that usual  and  methods don’t perform fast on items on the opposite side of the line. So Python’s  module provides that class called deque that’s specially designed to provide fast and memory-efficient ways to append and pop item from both ends.And then, we start looping through the sentences of the "text" block  (we provided it as an argument when we called the function), and for each sentence, we're gonna figure out its length, -including the space character at the end.
Now, you might be wondering, "But George, how do you know when to start a new chunk?" Well, my friends, it's all about that  variable and the one called  that we use as a counter to keep a running tally of the length of the current chunk. If the current sentence is gonna fit within the chunk size character limit, well, we're just gonna add it on and update the chunk length accordingly. That’s the normal way to go. Got it?
Now, if the length of the current sentence, plus the length of the chunk we've got so far, pushes us  the character limit we've set, well, we're gonna do a few things. First, we're gonna take all the sentences in the chunk and join 'em up with spaces, and then we're gonna yield that beasty. That just means we're gonna spit it out and move on to a new chunk.
Moving on to the next chunk means we're gonna clear out the chunk variable and start fresh, adding the current sentence to it and resetting the chunk length to just the length of that sentence, and then, just like before, we’ll keep rolling until we hit the limit again.
Finally, after we've gone through all the sentences, we're gonna yield the last chunk, if there is one.That’s it for our symphony of text-chunking perfection. And who knows.. maybe you'll even find yourself singing the praises of them deques and character limits soon.
  
  
  V. Print statements illuminate the path
The chronicles of progress are Written.Alright, but George, why do we need all these print statements? Isn't the script just supposed to, you know, just work?"
Well see, we've got this script that's doing all sorts of stuff, translating text and whatnot. But how are we supposed to know if it's working, huh? That's where these print statements come in, my friends, they're like the canaries in the coal mine. They're the early warning system that's gonna deal us some intel to let us know something's gone awry.
We're gonna print out the length of the input text. Because let's be real, how are we supposed to know if this thing is working if we don't know how much text we're dealing with, am I right? It's like trying to bake a cake without knowing how much flour you've got. There's more.. We're also gonna print out the number of chunks that the script has generated. And to top it all off, we're gonna print out the length of each of those chunks. Because, honestly, who doesn't love a good old-fashioned character count? It's like a little treasure hunt, but instead of finding gold, we're finding out how many letters are in each sentence.
A little  for when you will be contributing to bigger projects: there is that other breed of statements called . They're the quiet ones, they slip in the back door and get the job done without all the fanfare of the print. Just keep in mind they're the ones that keep a careful  when things start to get a little hairy.
  
  
  VI. The sorcery of the selectors
Their spell cast the way.Now it’s time to jump into some serious Selenium wizardry.The input field our marionette will search for.
You see, we've got this input field that we need to find on the web page, and we can't just go barging in there, hoping it'll be there. Instead, we've gotta harness the power of Selenium, which is gonna help us navigate this digital bytescape.
To understand this whole pasta here, We need to know more about’em selectors. See, when you're coding a website, just like a building, you got all sorts of elements fitting together - your headings, your paragraphs, buttons, an' the like. Each one of those elements, it's got its own little personality, just like a set of traits and characteristics. And to identify them, you can use all sorts of different selectors:  element selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, and many more other lads. Find out more here.That's where this get_input_textarea_element() function comes in. It's like a secret agent, carefully scanning the page, looking for that elusive  where you insert the text you want to translate.
But there’s a challenge to it: what's the point of finding the input field if it's not even ready for us to use? So first, we create a  object, and we instruct it to wait for up to  seconds (we've set it at the beginning as a parameter, by the way) for the element to be loaded and clickable thanks to this intriguing EC.element_to_be_clickable() thing that tells Selenium exactly what we're looking for. In this case, we're saying, "Hey, Selenium, find me an element that's clickable, and it's gotta match this . But.. how did I found that damn selector we've got here? Well, invoke the inspector by hitting  in Firefox. Then try the  combo, point & clic your target and in the inspector you'll be able to right clic the highlighted piece of code and extract its info.Concretely we’re looking to mimic human behavior just like when you paste your first chunk of text. Let’s break it down again:You select the input field by clicking on it (it’s selected).Depending of your laziness level, either you start typing or you just paste some text into that area.Well, our driver should be instructed to do the same.
Now, I know what you're thinking, "But George, what if the element never becomes clickable? What then?" Well, friends, that's where the  comes to the rescue. If the element doesn't become clickable within the  period, the whole thing is gonna throw an exception, and we'll know that something's gone wrong. Maybe the website has been updated and our old CSS selector pal is no more, or a networking problem occured somewhere. Whatever.
If everything goes according to plan, and Selenium manages to find that input field and confirm that it's ready for us to use, well, that's when the wonder happens. We're gonna return that element, and the rest of the script is gonna be able to work its magic.
  
  
  VII. The bridge of translation is crossed
Meaning is conveyed across the void.Alright, friends, gather 'round, because we're about to witness the main event, the grand finale and the moment you've all been waiting for - the translation process! Now, I know what you're thinking, "But George, how in the world is this script gonna take all those chunks of text and turn them into a beautiful translation?" Well, my friends, watch out.First, we're gonna set up an empty list called . Our little treasure trove of linguistic gold. This is where we're gonna store all the translated chunks.
And then, we're gonna start looping through those chunks, one by one. Now, I know what you're thinking, "But George, how are we gonna keep track of which chunk we're on?" Well, that's where the  function comes in, my friends. It's gonna give us the  of each chunk, so we can keep tabs on our progress.
As we loop through each chunk, we're gonna print out a little separator, just to let the user know that we're hard at work. And then, we're gonna send that chunk of text to the input field, using the  method. It's like we're typing the text over to the translation service, saying, "Here, take a look at this! A new text chunk for you to translate."
But we can't just sit back and wait, oh no, that would be way too easy. Instead, we're gonna print out a little message, letting the user know that we're fetching the translation. And then, we're gonna hit the  function, giving the translation service some time to achieve its task.
When the time is up, we're gonna use Selenium again to find the output area on the web page, and we're gonna grab the text that's been translated by now. We're talking about pure algorithmic alchemy, folks, turning one language into another with the click of a button. The thing there is just that we’re not behind the wheels anymore.
So once we've put our hands on that translated chunk, we're gonna append it to our translation list. And then, just to be on the safe side, we're gonna clear out the input field, making sure we're ready for the next chunk.
When we've gone through all the chunks, and collected all those translated gems, we're gonna return the whole  list  which is the result of all the translations we’ve collected.
  
  
  VIII. The file is written
The chronicle of the realm is inscribed.The last step starts by calling , and let me tell you, it's one of the unsung hero of this whole operation. Because, let's be honest, what's the point of all this translation process if we can't actually, you know, save the results somewhere?
So, here's how it works. First, we're gonna open up a file, using that  statement. And let me tell you, that , it's like a handshake that tells Python, "Hey, I'm about to do some serious file-handling business, so don't you dare interrupt me!" And what are we gonna do with this file, you ask? Well, my friends, we're gonna write some text to it. But not just any text, oh no, we're talking about the fruits of our labor, the translated chunks that we've been slaving over for who knows how long.
Now, I know what you're thinking, "But George, how are we gonna get all those chunks into the file?" Well, that's where the  function comes in. It's like a magic wand, taking our list of translated chunks and turning them into a cohesive piece of writing. When that file finally gets saved, it's gonna be all those chunks of text, neatly packaged up into a tangible reality: a file!
But you know, it's not just about the end result, folks. It's about the journey, the process of getting there. And this  function, was the final step in that journey. A cherry on top, mic drop moment that says, "We did it, folks, we translated the heck out of that text!"Managing files (loading a source file and writing results into another one).Witnessing that the true sorcery of this tutorial lies in the automated process of translating a text by splitting it into sentences, stacking them into  sent one by one to the online translation service, through Selenium, without ever exceeding a And the goodies: raise a glass to the coder's toolkit, by implementing some good practices (using a header, organizing the code using functions, parameters and a main(), use docstrings and type hints).That's just the beginning, isn't it? This Selenium business, it's got so much more to offer. The possibilities, they're practically endless, my friends. So I want you to take this code, tinker with it, experiment, see what else you can make it do. You’re ready to go.
Try it out on different translation services, see how it handles the variations. Heck, see if you can make it do your taxes while you're at it (okay, maybe not that, but you get the idea). The point is, this is tip of the iceberg. So, what are you waiting for? Good luck!The code is available on Github.(Cover picture: ).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Generating ~450 images for $0.50</title><link>https://dev.to/peter/generating-450-images-for-050-1elj</link><author>Peter Kim Frank</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 15:23:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been getting more and more interested in the Bittensor ecosystem, a decentralized, open-source network interconnected machine learning models.One of the more interesting "subnets" in the network is Chutes.ai which provides Serverless AI Compute across a bunch of different LLMs, image models, etc.  I had listened to them in a recent podcast interview and was looking for an excuse to play around.I asked DeepSeek-R1 to come up with 50 imaginative prompts:A celestial cathedral floating atop a spiraling nebula, its stained-glass windows depicting constellations come to life, gilded arches entwined with ivy made of starlight, surrounded by floating orbs of liquid mercuryAn opulent steampunk airship shaped like a mechanical peacock, its feathers crafted from interlocking brass gears and glowing amber lenses, hovering above a fog-shrouded Victorian metropolis illuminated by gaslampsA surreal garden where trees are composed of cascading sapphire ribbons, their roots embedded in pools of liquid gold, guarded by stone serpents with eyes of smoldering opal under a twilight sky streaked with aurorasAnd then ran those through 9 different image models:All in all, it cost about $0.50 (~$0.001 per image), which I paid for using $TAO, the native currency of Bittensor.I used Cursor's new-ish Agent mode to write the Python code to make all of this possible.

  The Fellowship of the Functions
:
 There's a whole lot going on under the hood, and you're gonna want to know what makes this thing tick.For the newcomers out there, on using functions:
Sometimes you got bits of code that you need to use over and over again, right? Well, functions, they make your code a whole lot easier to read and understand. I mean, think about it: instead of trying to decipher a tangled web of spaghetti code, you got these nice, neat little packages that do one thing and do it well. And when you need to make a change, well, you just gotta tweak the function, and b-a-m, problem solved. No muss, no fuss. Embrace 'em, you love 'em. Trust me, your future self is gonna thank you for it.First, let's have a look at this  version of the main function:
  
  
  The Initialization of the Browser
In which the Selenium-forged steed is summoned, and the journey begins.First, we've got the  function. This is where the magic starts - it's setting up a brand new instance of the Firefox browser, all decked out with our custom options.  mode is on by default! No need for a window to appear, we're going full stealth mode here.Where the words are divided into manageable chunks, as if by the wisdom of the regex.Next, we've got . This one's pretty straightforward - it's just reading the contents of a file and handing us back the text.
Then there's split_text_into_sentences(). This is where the script takes that input text and breaks it down into individual sentences. Gotta make sure we're not overwhelming the translation service, you know? Bite-sized chunks are the way to go.
And speaking of those chunks, that's where  comes in. It's taking those sentences and slicing them, making sure each sentence-block is small enough to play nice with the translation service. No more hitting character limits.
  
  
  The Gathering of the Fields
In which the input field is sought and found.Now, the real showstoppers: get_input_textarea_element(). This is the function that use Selenium to find the right spot on the web page to do our work. I mean the input field, where we're gonna pour in our text. Without it, no circus troupe at your fingertips, ready to leap through hoops an' do backflips at your every whim.
  
  
  The Fetching of the Results
The final step, where the fruits of the labors are harvested and the story ends.Finally, we've got  and . These are the heavy hitters.  is where the rubber meets the road, sending those sentence chunks off to be translated and bringing back the long awaited goods.  is the grand finale, putting the whole shebang down on paper (or, you know, in a file).
Whew, that's a lot to take in, I know. But well, once you've got this thing up and running, you’ll see, it's gonna be smooth sailing. Just sit back, let the wind.. Hmm.. the script do its thing.(Cover picture: ).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Basic Selenium – The Easy Peasy Introduction, Chapter 1 of 3</title><link>https://dev.to/atomictangerline/basic-selenium-the-easy-peasy-introduction-chapter-1-of-3-4fe3</link><author>brk</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 15:08:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Automating web-based tasks with Selenium? Efficiently. That's the name of the game here, so.. Take the reins and make technology work for you.A coding story in three chapters (with a bonus).There I was, sitting on a chair, having to gather all these newspaper translations, from who knows where, in who knows what languages. Let me tell you, it was a real slog. The , just wouldn't let me get the full show. Nothing but snippets, snippets, snippets...Then, the idea struck. This script, see, it's gonna let you bypass all that. No more copying and pasting. Just grab a coffee, make it strong, black and wait for the whole enchilada - right there in front of you. A real time-saver, I'm telling you.The best part? Turns out, it wasn't just about solving an immediate problem: it was about deepening my know-how, getting my hands dirty with some real-world programming. A win-win, if you ask me.
  
  
  Installation and Configuration
Alright, let's crack open this code. Step by step, we're gonna peel back the layers of that machine where each piece is fitting in like a puzzle. By the time we're done, you're gonna have a whole new appreciation for Selenium automation and what it can do.And beware, you're not just gonna be learning for learning's sake. Nah, this is about equipping you with the tools to tackle your own challenges. Whatever got you tied up in knots, this is your chance to untangle it and make it sing."Time to get this thing installed and ready to rock."First things first - you're gonna need to clone or download the source code. The repository is online here. Don't worry, I'll wait.If you don't already have Firefox on your system, you're gonna need to get that taken care of. For  Ubuntu and other Debianistas folks out there, it's a simple enough fix:apt update apt firefox
It’s also possible to use Chrome instead of Firefox.. It’s not covered here so if you really want it that way, it’s this way there.Next, we've got some packages to install. Nothing too crazy, but we gotta make sure we've got all the tools ready to roll. So fire up that trusty old pip and run:pip  requirements.txt
Boom. Done and done.
Now, the real kicker - . This is the secret sauce that sits behind the scenes, translating your commands into a language web browsers can understand.
You're gonna want to head over to the Mozilla repository, grab the latest version, and get it all set up. I'm talking extraction, permissions, symbolic links - the whole nine yards. And you know the magic? There’s a bash spell ready out there for that:wget https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/download/v0.35.0/geckodriver-v0.35.0-linux64.tar.gz  /tmp/geckodriver.tar.gz  /opt  /tmp/geckodriver.tar.gz 755 /opt/geckodriver  /opt/geckodriver /usr/bin/geckodriver  /opt/geckodriver /usr/local/bin/geckodriver
That's a mouthful, I know. But trust me, it's worth it. Once you've got all that squared away, you're gonna be almost ready to start automating like never before.Alright, folks, time to dive into the nitty-gritty of this configuration stuff. Because let me tell you, if you don't get this part right, the whole thing's gonna be about as useful as.. a lawn mower in the middle of the Mojave.
First up, we've got those  and  variables. Now, I know what you're thinking - "But how in the world am I supposed to know where these things are hiding on my system?" Well, fellas, depending on the one you’re looking for, there's a little bash command you can run to ferret that out:About the Gecko.. Remember that installation process we went through earlier? Well, the path you set up there is the one you'll want to use here. Not sure about it? No problem, same sauce, Just run:And Zap! Paste that info into the right place. Easy, right?
Now, the  parameter - this one's a bit of a wild card. See, you can run this whole thing in headless mode, which means the browser will run and do its job but won't actually show up on your screen. Kinda like a ninja, you know? But if you want to see what's going on, and watch your Firefox acting like possessed by a spirit you can set it to  and watch the magic unfold – try and see.As for the  and , well, pretty self-explanatory. Just pick the languages you want to translate to (source) and from (output), and the script will handle the rest. If you're looking to learn a little more about the available languages, take a glance at that readme file in the repository here.
Last but not least, we've got the , , and . These are all about fine-tuning the performance. , and  depend mostly on the speed of your network connection. It’s about how long we oughta wait for the website to be fully loaded so we can proceed with the translation.  is linked to deepL’s restrictions (currently 1500 characters). Tinker with them as needed, but be careful - you don't want to break the whole machine.
The  and  - those are the ones you'll want to point to your own input and output files. Simple enough, right? Just make sure you're pointing the input to something that actually contains text, because that's what this script is built to handle.
Now, a quick word of warning – the script is not perfect - if the output file doesn't exist yet, the script's gonna go ahead and create it for you. But if it does exist, well, buckle up, because the script's gonna overwrite it every time you run it. So, you know, maybe keep an eye on that (and specify a different output each time) if you don’t want to see your previous achievements disappear..Wait.. I almost forgot.. You're a  User? WSL now supports running Linux GUI applications in a fully integrated experience. On older configurations, you might need this if you intend to run Firefox as a marionette with its GUI.Once you've got those parameters all squared away, fire up the terminal, go to the script's folder and just run:Ka-boom, the show’s hit the road. The script's gonna take that input file, work its translation-y wonders, and spit out the results into your output file. Fear not, my friend just keep an eye on that output file, and you'll be able to see the fruits of that labor, plain as day.
What are you waiting for? Get out there, update those parameters, and let's see what kind of translation magic you can work!(Cover picture: ).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Day -02 of learning python programming language..</title><link>https://dev.to/kapil_kumarshahsonar_ad/day-02-of-learning-python-programming-language-22pl</link><author>KAPIL SHAH</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 14:11:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

This process enables organizations to make informed decisions. By analyzing data, businesses can gain a competitive edge, better understand customer behavior, and personalize their offerings.Python has emerged as a popular language for data analysis due to its simplicity and versatile ecosystem of libraries. Among these, Pandas stands out as a powerful tool, providing high-performance data manipulation and analysis capabilities. With Pandas, analysts can handle large datasets with ease, perform complex operations, and gain deep insights.Pandas is a powerful open-source library for data manipulation and analysis, primarily used with the Python programming language. It was developed by “Wes McKinney in 2008” while he was working at AQR Capital Management, a quantitative investment management firm.
  
  
  Key Features and Functionality
 Pandas offers two primary data structures — Series (one-dimensional) and DataFrame (two-dimensional) — which are highly flexible and efficient for handling structured data. It provides powerful tools for data manipulation, including filtering, grouping, merging, reshaping, and pivoting data sets. Essential functions for handling missing data, duplicate data, and data type conversions, which are crucial for preparing data for analysis. we can able to integrates with other libraries and tools in the Python ecosystem, such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and SciPy, enhancing its functionality for comprehensive data analysis and visualization.Ensure Python is Installed: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.
Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command:Basic setup and configuration.Loading and Inspecting DataVarious types of data like CSV, Excel, SQL databases, etc can load using below command# Read a csv file

 renaming columns, changing data types, and handling duplicates.# Rename columns
df.rename(columns={'old_name': 'new_name'}, inplace=True)
# Convert data types of a column
df['column_name'] = df['column_name'].astype('int')
# Drop duplicates
df.drop_duplicates()

# Keep the first occurrence of duplicates
df.drop_duplicates(keep='first')

# Keep the last occurrence of duplicates
df.drop_duplicates(keep='last')

  
  
  Data Analysis and Exploration with Pandas
Once the data is cleaned and prepared, the next steps involve performing descriptive statistics. Below are detailed examples of how to perform these tasks using Pandas.Basic Descriptive Statistics:# Generate descriptive statistics for numerical columns
df.describe()
Individual Statistic Calculations:# Mean
mean_age = df['age'].mean()

# Median
median_income = df['income'].median()

# Standard Deviation
std_income = df['income'].std()

# Variance
var_income = df['income'].var()

# Minimum
min_age = df['age'].min()

# Maximum
max_age = df['age'].max()

# Count
count_gender = df['gender'].count()

print(f"Mean Age: {mean_age}, Median Income: {median_income}")

  
  
  Data Visualization with Pandas
Data visualization is a key aspect of data analysis, helping to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that might not be apparent from the raw data alone. Pandas offers built-in plotting capabilities through its integration with Matplotlib, and it can also be used in conjunction with other libraries like Seaborn for more advanced visualizations.Basic Plotting with Pandasimport pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Month': ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May'],
    'Sales': [200, 220, 250, 270, 300]
})

# Line plot
df.plot(x='Month', y='Sales', kind='line')

# Bar plot
df.plot(x='Month', y='Sales', kind='bar')

# Histogram
df['Age'].plot(kind='hist', bins=5)

# Scatter plot
df.plot(x='Height', y='Weight', kind='scatter')

plt.title('Monthly Sales')
plt.xlabel('Month')
plt.ylabel('Sales')
plt.show()
