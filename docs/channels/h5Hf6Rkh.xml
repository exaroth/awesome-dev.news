That post set the stage for developers and testers who wanted to begin their journey into automation, but it was just the beginning.As more development teams integrate quality earlier in the SDLC, there's increasing demand for professionals who can not only write clean Python code but also automate real-world scenarios on web applications. That‚Äôs where Selenium with Python comes in. This article is a step-by-step guide for those looking to connect their Python skills with browser-based automation, starting from scratch and growing toward building robust automation suites.If you're a Python developer exploring QA responsibilities or a QA engineer wanting to strengthen your Python automation foundation, this is for you.
  
  
  What Is Selenium, and Why Pair It with Python?
Selenium is the de facto standard for browser automation. It allows you to simulate everything a real user would do on a website‚Äîclicking, typing, scrolling, verifying content, navigating tabs, and more. Selenium WebDriver directly controls browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, making it perfect for testing across environments.
  
  
  Why Python for Selenium Automation?
Python stands out for a few key reasons:Concise syntax: Short, readable scripts allow teams to iterate faster.Powerful ecosystem: Integration with pytest, unittest, pandas, requests, and faker makes Python automation extremely flexible.Beginner-friendly: New testers and developers can quickly start coding without excessive boilerplate.Together, Selenium and Python form a fast, maintainable, and extensible way to automate your testing process, without steep learning curves.
  
  
  Step 1: Setting Up Selenium with Python
Before you write a single test case, set up your Python + Selenium environment:1. Install Selenium via pip:
pip install selenium2. Download the Chrome WebDriver:Once setup is done, you‚Äôre ready to write your first browser automation script.
  
  
  Step 2: Writing a Basic Selenium Test Script in Python
Let‚Äôs create a simple automated test: open Google, perform a search, and close the browser.from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keysdriver = webdriver.Chrome()search_box = driver.find_element("name", "q")search_box.send_keys("Selenium automation with Python")
search_box.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)driver.implicitly_wait(5)
driver.quit()Opened a browser and navigated to a URLFound a search input element using the name locatorTyped a query and submitted itWaited for results and closed the sessionThis is your first successful test of a working UI automation flow!
  
  
  Step 3: Locating and Interacting with Web Elements
Selenium allows you to find and interact with web elements using multiple strategies. Some commonly used methods include:from selenium.webdriver.common.by import Byemail_input = driver.find_element(By.ID, "email")
email_input.send_keys("test@example.com")You can also perform advanced actions like:These interactions simulate actual user behavior, helping you verify UI flows more reliably.
  
  
  Step 4: Dealing with Waits ‚Äì The Right Way
Web apps are dynamic, and elements don‚Äôt always load instantly. Without waits, your test may fail because the element wasn‚Äôt there‚Äîyet.Implicit Wait:
Applies globally:driver.implicitly_wait(10)  # SecondsExplicit Wait:
Targeted, preferred in modern test scripts:from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as ECelement = WebDriverWait(driver, 15).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, "username"))Use explicit waits when you need to validate specific states like visibility, presence, or clickability.
  
  
  Step 5: Managing Dynamic Test Data
Hardcoded values might work in small tests, but for scalable automation, parameterized, random, or external test data is essential.CSV or Excel files (via pandas)JSON files for structured test casesData generation libraries like fakerfake = Faker()
print(fake.name())        # Random full name
print(fake.email())       # Random email addressThis reduces repetition and improves test realism‚Äîespecially in sign-up or form automation.
  
  
  Step 6: Structuring and Scaling Your Test Suite
As your test cases grow, proper structuring becomes critical. Key practices include:Using pytest for test discovery, grouping, and fixturesModularizing test logic into reusable functionsSeparating page locators using Page Object Model (POM)Externalizing configuration (URLs, credentials, etc.)Sample test file structure:tests/
  test_login.py
pages/
  signup_page.py
  data_generator.py
  
  
  Final Thoughts: Python + Selenium Is Just the Beginning
Selenium with Python gives you direct control over browser-based tests, helping you ensure real user experiences are not just functional, but consistent across deployments.Whether you're building a test suite from scratch or integrating with CI/CD platforms like Jenkins or GitHub Actions‚ÄîPython provides the flexibility and readability to scale your automation goals effectively.Need Help Scaling Your Python Test Automation?

Similarly, web apps need a clear structure to stay organized and maintainable. This is where architectural patterns like MVC and MVT come in!Django, a popular Python framework, follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) pattern.Beginners often confuse MVT with the traditional Model-View-Controller (MVC).This article will clarify the differences and explain Django‚Äôs unique approach.MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, a software design pattern that separates an application into three main components:1.Model: Handles data and business logic2.View: Handles display and user interface3.Controller: Handles user input and mediates between Model and ViewHow Django Implements This PatternLet‚Äôs break it down with a blog website example:A visitor clicks "View Post" on /post/1.Receives the request: "Show me Post ID 1".Asks the Model to fetch the data.Talks to the database: .Returns the post data (title, content, author).Passes the data to the View.Renders an HTML template with the post data.MVC in Popular FrameworksFramework   Language    MVC Implementation
Ruby on Rails   Ruby    Controllers (*.rb), Views (*.erb), Models (ActiveRecord)
Laravel PHP UserController.php, User.php (Model), Blade templates
ASP.NET MVC C#  UserController.cs, User.cs, Razor Views

Or seen a piece of writing generated by AI that‚Äôs almost indistinguishable from something written by a person? These experiences are becoming increasingly common thanks to Large Language Models (LLMs). But what exactly  these powerful tools, and what does their rise mean for the future?LLMs are sophisticated computer programs designed to understand and generate human language. Think of them as incredibly advanced autocomplete systems, but on a massive scale. Instead of suggesting the next word in a sentence, they can generate entire paragraphs, essays, even poems, based on the input they receive. This ability stems from their ‚Äútraining‚Äù on massive datasets of text and code ‚Äì think of it as reading every book, article, and website ever written. This massive exposure allows them to learn patterns, relationships between words, and the nuances of human language.Imagine teaching a child to write by showing them countless examples of well-written stories. Eventually, the child learns the rules of grammar, sentence structure, and even develops a unique writing style. LLMs work similarly, but at a scale unimaginable to human learning. They analyze billions of words, identifying statistical probabilities of word combinations and contextual relationships. This enables them to predict the most likely next word, sentence, or paragraph in response to a given prompt.The significance of LLMs cannot be overstated. They represent a leap forward in artificial intelligence, pushing the boundaries of what computers can achieve in understanding and generating human-quality text. This has far-reaching implications across numerous fields. They address problems like the need for efficient content creation, accurate translation, and personalized learning experiences, while also opening up opportunities for innovation we are only beginning to understand.Applications and Transformative Impact:The applications of LLMs are already vast and rapidly expanding. Here are a few key examples: LLMs can generate various forms of content, including articles, marketing copy, scripts, and even creative writing. This can significantly increase efficiency for businesses and individuals, streamlining content production and potentially reducing costs. LLMs excel at translating text between languages, offering more accurate and nuanced translations than previous methods. This can break down communication barriers and facilitate global collaboration.  AI-powered chatbots driven by LLMs provide instant customer support, answering frequently asked questions and resolving basic issues, freeing up human agents to handle more complex problems. LLMs can personalize learning experiences by generating customized exercises, quizzes, and feedback for students.  They can also help create educational content in various formats. LLMs can assist programmers by generating code snippets, suggesting improvements, and even helping to debug existing code, increasing development speed and efficiency. LLMs can analyze medical texts, assist in diagnosis, and even help develop new treatments by identifying patterns and relationships in vast datasets.Challenges, Limitations, and Ethical Considerations:Despite their potential, LLMs are not without limitations and challenges: LLMs are trained on existing data, which may reflect societal biases.  This can lead to the generation of biased or discriminatory outputs, requiring careful monitoring and mitigation strategies. LLMs can sometimes generate incorrect or nonsensical information, a phenomenon known as ‚Äúhallucination.‚Äù  Their outputs should always be critically evaluated and verified. The potential misuse of LLMs for malicious purposes, such as generating fake news or impersonating individuals, raises serious ethical concerns.  Robust safeguards and regulations are crucial to prevent such misuse. The training of LLMs requires significant computational resources, leading to a substantial carbon footprint.  Developing more energy-efficient training methods is essential.  The automation potential of LLMs raises concerns about job displacement in certain sectors.  Addressing this requires proactive measures like retraining and upskilling initiatives.Large Language Models represent a powerful and transformative technology with the potential to reshape numerous aspects of our lives. While challenges remain, ongoing research and development are actively addressing issues related to bias, accuracy, and ethical implications. As LLMs continue to evolve, we can expect even more sophisticated and impactful applications, further blurring the lines between human and machine intelligence. The key lies in responsible development, deployment, and regulation to ensure these powerful tools benefit humanity as a whole. The future of LLMs is not just about technological advancement; it's about navigating the ethical and societal implications to harness their potential for good.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ANN</title><link>https://dev.to/docmath/ann-5b8g</link><author>Dr. Mathews K.

  What is the Excitement Score?
As someone aspiring to work in sports data content, I designed the  based on what I feel makes a football match more engaging:Both teams scoring adds immersion and drama, so I gave it a weight of 3 points.
-** Total goals **are the core fun factor, weighted 2 points.**Total shots **represent match dynamism, contributing 0.5 points each.I considered including other factors like red and yellow cards to reflect game intensity, but my current skill set limited this for now.This score is my personal interpretation of what makes a match exciting. If your experience or the industry‚Äôs view differs, I‚Äôd love to hear your feedback! I‚Äôm eager to learn and improve this metric to better reflect real-world excitement.This project is a first step toward my goal of becoming a sports data content creator.

How does a computer understand instructions written with all those functions, lists, and other components?In this blog post ‚Äî just to make things fun and more memorable ‚Äî we‚Äôll explore how Python code is run through an analogy of a chef trying to cook a dish from a recipe written in a foreign language.Before we dive in, it is important to note that unlike Python, a lot of programming languages like C++ and Java use . Compilers convert the code written in their respective languages to machine-level , allowing any computer to run them.However, Python takes a different approach involving an interpreter, bytecode, and PVM (Python Virtual Machine).An interpreter works kind of like a compiler, but instead of converting the  code into binary, it translates it to something called , which is saved as a  file in the  folder.üßë‚Äçüç≥
We can think of an interpreter as a translator who converts the recipe from a foreign language to visuals, and those visuals as the bytecode. Visuals are not the final dish, but they are something the chef can work with.
  
  
  What is a PVM (Python Virtual Machine)?
Since Bytecode is a language in between normal Python code and machine code, we need a special tool to execute it. This is where the Python Virtual Machine (PVM) comes in.The PVM reads the bytecode and executes the written instructions line-by-line. It is responsible for executing loops, logic statements, etc. ‚Äî all during runtime.üßë‚Äçüç≥
The PVM is the chef who can understand the visual instructions (bytecode) and cook the dish as requested. The chef doesn‚Äôt involve with the original recipe ( file) ‚Äî they just follow the translated instructions.Here is a diagram that sums up the whole process (with the analogy):]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I have included the Experimental Results section to strengthen the algorithm‚Äôs empirical validation.

Testing against resources deployed in the cloud isn‚Äôt free.Secondly, an active & reliable internet connection is required, it‚Äôs not ideal to have your tests bound to the internet. You might find yourself at a conference with slow and limited wifi connectivity or a space with public wifi that shouldn‚Äôt be trusted. You could be on a plane or train, you might even find yourself in a remote area.Mocking allows you to run tests locally without incurring additional costs. Everyone loves to save money after all.
  
  
  Setting Up Your Test Environment
Some preparation is required to ensure we can run our tests, we need a way for our tests to import modules that we have written as well as letting  know where these files are located.This can be achieved by creating a  file as well as a  file. file gets the absolute path of the project root directory. file sets the path for our app, test paths and silences a deprecation warning for .Create these files at your project‚Äôs root:
  
  
  Your First Test: The Root Endpoint
Create a directory that will be a home for our , name it tests and within this directory create a file named .Let‚Äôs create a test for our root endpoint, add the following imports at the top of the file:Create a  object and pass  as an argument, add a test function named , see below for the complete code snippet:Run pytest test_player.py::test_root in the terminal window. The test should pass.We will use  to provide a defined, reliable and consistent context for our tests. This will include player data, mocked AWS credentials for moto and our mock DynamoDB table.Let‚Äôs add a couple of fixtures to our code, we will start with creating a fixture that contains a single player‚Äôs data, add this code directly below the  object we created earlier:Now we need to take a similar approach for representing all players, however creating a function with all this data will make the code long, a better approach would be to create a separate json file and load the data when the function is called.Create a file named  in the  directory and populate it with the below:Add the below code to create a fixture that will load the all players data from the json file when the function is called:
  
  
  Mocking AWS credentials and DynamoDB service
Create a fixture that will mock AWS credentials for below by adding the below code:The mocked AWS credentials will be used as an argument for our mock DynamoDB table, add the below code to create another fixture for mocking the AWS DynamoDB service:With all the fixtures created, we are now at a stage that we can begin testing the other endpoints that would normally interact with AWS services, albeit mocked in nature.We can create a test that will create and return the player data, this function takes in the  and  fixtures we created earlier as arguments, add the below code:Run pytest test_player.py::test_create_and_get_player, this test too shall pass.Onto the next endpoint, lets test if we can get all players, this will be achieved by loading the players data from a json file and asserting that players names are found and if a certain player is not found.Run pytest test_player.py::test_get_all_playersWe‚Äôre on a roll with tests that are passing at this stage, lets test the endpoint for updating a player details, the player in question is , he will be transferring to  and will take up the number 10 jersey.Run pytest test_player.py::test_update_playerNow let‚Äôs create a test for removing a player.Run pytest test_player.py::test_delete_playerThe final test is an edge case, lets create a test when removing a non existent player, an error 404 should be returned since the player does not exist.Run pytest test_player.py::test_delete_non_existent_player: Locking down your Lambda Function URL because security isn‚Äôt optional.

While Python‚Äôs for loops don‚Äôt require a separate counter by default, there are times when we need both the item and its index.That‚Äôs where Python‚Äôs built-in enumerate() function comes in. It simplifies looping by giving you the index and the element in a clean and Pythonic way.**
The enumerate() function adds a counter to an iterable and returns it as an enumerate object. You can use it directly in a for loop to access both the index and the value of each element.enumerate(iterable, start=0)
words = ['apple', 'boy', 'cat', 'dog', 'egg', 'fish']
 for i, word in enumerate(words):
Output:You get both the index and the item ‚Äî no need for range() or manually tracking the index.
The Old Way: Without enumerate()
You might be doing something like this:for i in range(len(words)):
    print(i, words[i])
or even:index = 0
 for word in words:
     index += 1
Both approaches work, but they are longer, messier, and less readable.
Makes your loop cleaner and more readable
Eliminates the need for range(len(...))
Removes manual index tracking.
Tracking line numbers while reading a file
Displaying quiz options or menu items
Debugging: print index with values
Displaying numbered data in terminal apps
enumerate() is one of those small but powerful tools in Python that makes a big difference in how clean and elegant your code looks.
It‚Äôs a must-know for any beginner, and a great habit for writing better loops.Next time you reach for range(len(...)), consider using enumerate() instead.

Let‚Äôs get into it!The MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern is a software architectural pattern that separates application logic into three interconnected components: The part that handles the . It defines how data is stored, retrieved, and manipulated ‚Äî usually tied to a database. The  or representation layer. It presents the data to the user. The  that handles user input, updates the model, and decides which view to show.This separation makes applications easier to scale and maintain.
  
  
  Here's a visual breakdown:
MVC is widely used in frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Laravel (PHP), and ASP.NET.
  
  
  Enter Django: The MVT Way
Django follows the  architectural pattern, which is a variation of the traditional  design pattern used in web development. This pattern separates the application into three main components: Manages the data ‚Äî built using Django‚Äôs ORM. Defines the structure of your database.View (different from MVC): In Django, the ‚ÄúView‚Äù contains the . It fetches data from the model and passes it to the template. Responsible for rendering the final  ‚Äî your front-end content.Now here‚Äôs the diffrence:In Django, the "View" from MVC is called the "Template", and the "Controller" role is handled by the Django framework itself.So Django's View is actually the Controller in traditional MVC!
  
  
  here is the visual breakdown

  
  
  üîÅ Side-by-Side: MVC vs MVT

  
  
  here is the visual breakdown!
So Django automates a lot of what traditional MVC expects you to write manually. 
  
  
  üõ†Ô∏è Example: A Simple Blog
Let‚Äôs say we‚Äôre building a blog:
{% for post in posts %}
  {{ post.title }}{{ post.content }}{{ post.date_posted }}
{% endfor %}
This is the heart of Django‚Äôs MVT ‚Äî clean separation, yet tightly integrated by Django‚Äôs robust request handling. You work on templates separately from the business logic and data models. The model definitions give you an auto-generated backend. The architecture supports large projects out-of-the-box. You can go from idea to MVP in record time.By understanding how MVT maps to traditional MVC, you'll appreciate Django‚Äôs design even more. It's MVC with a twist ‚Äî and that twist is what makes Django so .

  üéâ Welcome to Day 5 of Django Journey!
Today, we break down the architecture that powers Django apps ‚Äî the  pattern ‚Äî and compare it to the classic . If you've heard about , , , and got confused, you're not alone! Let‚Äôs untangle that web. üï∏Ô∏è
  
  
  üß† MVC vs MVT ‚Äî What‚Äôs the Difference?
Before diving into Django specifics, let‚Äôs explore what these patterns mean.
  
  
  üß© MVC (Model-View-Controller)
This pattern separates your application into: ‚Äì The data and database layer. ‚Äì The UI or frontend display. ‚Äì The logic that controls data flow between the Model and View.Used in frameworks like Laravel, Ruby on Rails, and ASP.NET.
  
  
  üß© MVT (Model-View-Template) in Django
Django follows MVT, which looks very similar: ‚Äì Represents data (just like MVC). ‚Äì Handles logic and pulls data from the model. ‚Äì The HTML interface shown to users.In Django, the View is like the Controller in MVC, and the Template acts as the View.
  
  
  üèóÔ∏è Let‚Äôs Understand Each MVT Component

  
  
  üîπ 1. Model ‚Äì Your Data's Structure
The Model defines how data is stored in the database using Django‚Äôs ORM (Object Relational Mapping). It avoids writing raw SQL.Models map directly to database tables.Each class = 1 table, each field = 1 column.The View is the middleman. It receives user requests, talks to the model, then selects the template to display.python
def home(request):
    posts = BlogPost.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'home.html', {'posts': posts})Think of Views as your app‚Äôs .It returns a response, usually HTML.
  
  
  üîπ 3. Template ‚Äì The Frontend
Templates are what users see ‚Äî HTML files with dynamic placeholders.html
{% for post in posts %}
  <h2>{{ post.title }}</h2>
  <p>{{ post.content|truncatewords:20 }}</p>Templates use Django Template Language (DTL).They display data passed by the view.Django uses a URL dispatcher to connect browser paths to views.python
path('', views.home, name='home')
  
  
  üß≠ The Flow of Data (Visual Recap)
plaintext
Browser Request
  URLConf (urls.py)
     View (views.py)
   Model (if needed)
  Template (HTML page)
Browser Response
  
  
  üîê Admin Panel ‚Äì MVT in Action
Register a model and get a full-featured admin UI to create, read, update, and delete records!python
admin.site.register(BlogPost)Then visit  after running:bash

Leaving files or network connections open can cause resource leaks, meaning you‚Äôre using up system memory or leaving a file locked unnecessarily. That‚Äôs where context managers come in. They handle the ‚Äúsetup and teardown‚Äù automatically so you can focus on your logic without worrying about the cleanup.This blog will guide you through:What a context manager isHow  and  workReal-life use cases and examplesHow to write your own context managers both class-based and function-based
  
  
  What Is a Context Manager?
A context manager is a Python object that properly manages resources like files, network connections, or database sessions. It makes sure things are set up when you enter a block of code and cleaned up when you leave it, even if something goes wrong.You‚Äôve already used one before:What this does behind the scenes:Python calls , then It runs your  inside the  blockWhen the block is done or crashes, it calls  to close the fileYou didn‚Äôt have to write a / block. Python cleaned up for you.
  
  
  The  and  Methods
To create a context manager yourself, you need a class that defines two special methods:Let‚Äôs see this in action with a simple logger.
  
  
  Example 1: A Simple Logging Context Manager
Starting the timer...
Elapsed time: 1.50 seconds
Even if there‚Äôs an error inside the block,  still runs which is great for cleanup.Let‚Äôs take this a bit further. Here are some practical real-world problems you can solve with custom context managers.
  
  
  1. Automatically Closing ResourcesImagine you're working with file handles, network sockets, or database connections. You need to ensure they're closed no matter what happens.2. Temporarily Change Working DirectoryYou might want to run a script in a different folder temporarily and go back automatically.It cleanly returns you to your original path. Great for file-heavy automation scripts.
  
  
  3. Thread Locking in MultithreadingWorking with ?The lock is automatically released after the block.
  
  
  4. Suppressing Output TemporarilySometimes you use a noisy library that prints too much. You can silence it:This is handy when running external tools or verbose APIs.Want to retry a risky operation automatically?You just built a mini fault-tolerant system!Context managers are one of Python‚Äôs most powerful but underused features. Once you start using them, you'll find dozens of places where they clean up your code and prevent bugs especially around resources, cleanup, and state changes.You need something to be cleaned up after useYou're dealing with files, sockets, locks, or temporary stateYou want readable and bug-resistant codeStart small. Try writing one or two yourself. You‚Äôll see how easy and useful they really are.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Use Vibe Coding Without Making a Mess (And What I Learned Along the Way)</title><link>https://dev.to/urielcuriel_41/how-to-use-vibe-coding-without-making-a-mess-and-what-i-learned-along-the-way-230m</link><author>Uriel Curiel</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 16:15:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ is everywhere lately‚Äîmostly as a meme or criticism aimed at people trying to build software without really knowing how to code, or at replacing developers with AI.
But‚Ä¶ what happens when it's used by an experienced engineer solving a real problem?Spoiler: the problem wasn‚Äôt the AI. It was me, thinking in TypeScript while coding in Python.In this post, I want to share how I went from a vibe-coded AI-generated PoC full of forced ideas to a robust, clean and 20x faster solution. Not to convince you to use AI, but to show how you can actually benefit from it without forgetting good design principles.
  
  
  From a Proof of Concept to a working idea (with GitHub Copilot)
Before I sit down and start writing code for hours straight, I prefer to plan what I want to build using Design Docs (if you want me to write about that, let me know in the comments). So I started thinking about the architecture I‚Äôd need to solve my problem: a way to parse semantic chunks from large documents to improve context and accuracy in RAGs.Once I had the architecture, I started asking Copilot to write different parts of it. And here‚Äôs where I made my first conceptual mistake: I was thinking in TypeScript, not in a ‚Äúpythonic‚Äù way.I‚Äôve been using Nest.js for years, and it got me used to a specific and powerful way of building apps, where it‚Äôs common to define logic and metadata using . My plan, described in the Design Doc, followed that philosophy:Node definitions with class and property decorators:
I imagined classes for each node type (like Rule, Article, Paragraph) and decorators like  or  on properties.A centralized and smart TreeBuilder:
It would introspect the classes, read the decorators and metadata, and build the tree.Inheritance only for nesting, not behavior:
The main logic lived inside the TreeBuilder, not in the nodes themselves.With this TypeScript-style mindset, the AI was the perfect coding buddy. Like a junior developer with a lot of knowledge but no judgment, it did exactly what I asked: metaclasses, introspection, magic.  And yeah, the code worked. It met all the requirements from the Design Doc. The PoC was a success. But the code felt messy and overengineered. It looked like a TypeScript project wearing Python syntax.
  
  
  Refactoring with real software engineering: from ‚Äúwhat‚Äù to idiomatic ‚Äúhow‚Äù
This is where the real engineering starts. With the PoC validated, I went back to the Design Doc‚Äînot to change the goal, but to rethink the implementation.The code was the result of asking for a ‚Äútranslation‚Äù of a pattern, instead of asking for a ‚Äúpythonic‚Äù solution. So I decided to refactor it. This time, I was the architect, and the AI was just my assistant.Replace decorators and metaclasses with basic inheritance.Use  for data-only structures.Remove the central builder logic and let each class build itself.I still used the AI, but now with more precise instructions:,‚Äù ‚ÄúSuggest a method for the base class,‚Äù and so on.
  
  
  The measurable impact of simplicity
After refactoring, I wrote performance tests using a big and complex document to compare both versions. And the results were clear:Refactored (Human-AI guided)The new version wasn‚Äôt just faster‚Äîit was also smarter, more readable, and easier to maintain. All because I chose simplicity and good design.
  
  
  Final thoughts: our role in the  era
This project taught me something important:  with AI is amazing for quick prototyping. It lets us explore ideas fast.

For the first time, I clearly understood how Django‚Äôs MVT (Model‚ÄìView‚ÄìTemplate) compares to the more commonly discussed MVC (Model‚ÄìView‚ÄìController) pattern. 
Spoiler: it‚Äôs not as different as it sounds but Django definitely does things its own way. ‚Äì Handles business logic and database structure. ‚Äì The UI: what the user sees (HTML, CSS). ‚Äì Logic that connects user input, the model, and the viewClassic, clean, and logical.
  
  
  Django‚Äôs MVT ‚Äî The Same but Different
Django swaps out some names and bakes a few decisions into the framework for you. Here's Django's version: ‚Äì Still your database structure and logic, powered by Django ORM ‚Äì Unlike MVC, this is your Python function or class that handles requests and responses ‚Äì Where your HTML and front end presentation livesAnd the  stays the same
  
  
  Visualizing the Architecture
Here's a side-by-side comparison I found helpful:MVC                        Django MVT
--------------------      --------------------
Model       ‚Üí  Model       (unchanged)
View        ‚Üí  Template    (the UI)
Controller  ‚Üí  View        (Python logic)
And here's a diagram that makes it even clearer:This really helped me lock in Django's flow: Request ‚Üí View (logic) ‚Üí Model (if needed) ‚Üí Template (response)Here‚Äôs what made it click. I wrote this Django view:def home(request):
    return render(request, 'home.html', {'msg': 'Welcome to Day 5!'})
Then connected it to , where I rendered that  variable. That‚Äôs when it hit me:The  here is controlling the flow it‚Äôs the Controller.The  is responsible only for display just like MVC's View.Suddenly, MVT made total sense.I used to misplace logic doing too much in templates or confusing Django‚Äôs terminology. Now:I know where business logic belongs (views and models)I respect Django‚Äôs separation of concernsI debug faster, because I understand what each layer is responsible forCreated function-based views with context dataConnected views to templates using urls.pyExplored class-based views (will dive deeper soon)This laid the groundwork for understanding more advanced patterns like mixins, CBVs, and reusable components.‚ÄúMVT helped me understand MVC more clearly.‚ÄùFunny how Django‚Äôs unique naming convention challenged me then clarified everything I‚Äôd half-learned in other frameworks.If you‚Äôre new to Django or architecture in general, don‚Äôt stress. Let the code teach you. The more you build, the clearer it becomes.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>EvoAgentX for Energy Markets: Build AI Agents That See the Risk Before the Spike</title><link>https://dev.to/evoagentx/evoagentx-for-energy-markets-build-ai-agents-that-see-the-risk-before-the-spike-g8d</link><author>EvoAgentX</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 15:33:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The future of oil price intelligence isn‚Äôt on Wall Street ‚Äî it‚Äôs open-source, evolving, and just one prompt away.

This isn't science fiction; it's the reality of generative AI, specifically text-to-image models. These powerful algorithms are transforming how we create and interact with visual content, ushering in a new era of artistic expression and technological innovation.Understanding the Magic: How Text Becomes an ImageAt its core, a text-to-image model is a sophisticated computer program trained on massive datasets of images and their corresponding text descriptions. Think of it like teaching a child to draw by showing them countless pictures and telling them what they depict. Over time, the child learns to associate words with visual elements ‚Äì a "fluffy white cat" evokes images of soft fur and round eyes. Similarly, these AI models learn the complex relationships between words and visual features.The process begins with a text prompt, a sentence or paragraph describing the desired image. This prompt is then fed into a neural network ‚Äì a complex system inspired by the human brain ‚Äì that has been trained to understand the meaning and nuances of language and translate them into visual representations. The network doesn't simply search for pre-existing images; it generates entirely new ones based on its learned understanding. It essentially "paints" a picture based on your textual instructions.This process involves several intricate steps, including: The model converts the text prompt into a numerical representation that it can understand. Using this numerical representation, the model generates a latent representation, a compressed form of the image.  The latent representation is then decoded into a full-fledged image, often using techniques like diffusion models that gradually refine a noisy image into a coherent one.Significance and Impact: A New Creative FrontierThe significance of text-to-image models cannot be overstated. They democratize image creation, empowering individuals without artistic training to generate stunning visuals. This has profound implications across numerous fields:Marketing and Advertising: Businesses can quickly and cost-effectively create compelling visuals for campaigns, websites, and social media.  Generating diverse and detailed game assets becomes significantly faster and more efficient.  Text-to-image models can aid in concept art, storyboarding, and even generating background elements.  Students can use these tools to visualize abstract concepts and create engaging educational materials.  Artists can utilize these models as powerful creative tools, augmenting their own skills and exploring new artistic styles.Applications and Transformative Potential:The potential applications are vast and rapidly expanding. Imagine architects using text prompts to visualize building designs, fashion designers creating virtual garment prototypes, or scientists visualizing complex biological structures. The ability to translate abstract ideas into concrete visual representations opens up exciting possibilities across industries, accelerating innovation and streamlining workflows.Challenges, Limitations, and Ethical Considerations:Despite its immense potential, text-to-image technology faces several challenges:  Models trained on biased datasets can perpetuate harmful stereotypes in generated images.  Addressing this requires careful curation of training data and ongoing monitoring.  The legal implications of AI-generated art are still being debated, raising questions about ownership and copyright infringement.Misinformation and Deepfakes:  The ease of creating realistic but fake images raises concerns about the spread of misinformation and the potential for malicious use.  While creating new opportunities, the technology also raises concerns about potential job displacement in certain creative industries.The Future of Text-to-Image Models:Text-to-image models are still evolving rapidly. Future developments will likely focus on improving image quality, enhancing control over generation parameters, and mitigating ethical concerns. We can expect to see more sophisticated models capable of understanding complex prompts, generating more realistic and diverse images, and even creating interactive and animated content directly from text.In conclusion, generative AI's text-to-image models represent a significant leap forward in artificial intelligence and its application to visual content creation. While challenges remain, the transformative potential of this technology is undeniable. As it continues to evolve, it promises to revolutionize how we create, interact with, and understand the visual world around us, opening up exciting opportunities across numerous fields and shaping the future of creativity and innovation.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Creating a Website with Sphinx and Markdown</title><link>https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2025/07/01/creating-a-website-with-sphinx-and-markdown/</link><author>Mike</author><category>dev</category><category>official</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 12:28:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/">Python Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sphinx is a Python-based documentation builder.

Decorators can be a bit mind-bending when first encountered and can also be a bit tricky to debug. But they are a neat way to add functionality to functions and classes. Decorators are also known as a ‚Äúhigher-order function‚Äù. This means that they can take one or more functions as arguments and return a function as its result. In other words, decorators will take the function they are decorating and extend its behavior while not actually modifying what the function itself does.

There have been two decorators in Python since version 2.2, namely **classmethod()** and **staticmethod()**. Then PEP 318 was put together and the decorator syntax was added to make decorating functions and methods possible in Python 2.4. Class decorators were proposed in PEP 3129 to be included in Python 2.6.

Let‚Äôs start off by talking about functions in general to get a foundation to work from.

## The Humble Function

A function in Python and in many other programming languages is just a collection of reusable code. Some programmers will take an almost bash-like approach and just write all their code in a file with no functions. The code just runs from top to bottom. This can lead to a lot of copy-and-paste spaghetti code. Whenever two pieces of code do the same thing, they can almost always be put into a function.

  Authentication in Production Python: Beyond the Basics
In late 2022, a critical production incident at a previous employer stemmed from a subtle flaw in our authentication handling for background job processing. We were using Celery with Redis as a broker, and a deserialization vulnerability in a custom authentication middleware allowed an attacker to inject malicious code into a job payload, ultimately gaining read access to sensitive data. The root cause wasn‚Äôt a missing security library, but a failure to properly validate the authentication token  the deserialization process, coupled with overly permissive pickling. This incident underscored the fact that authentication isn‚Äôt a single point solution; it‚Äôs a pervasive concern woven throughout the entire system, demanding meticulous attention to detail.  This post dives deep into the practicalities of authentication in modern Python ecosystems, focusing on architecture, performance, and real-world pitfalls.
  
  
  What is "authentication" in Python?
Technically, authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or service. It answers the question "Who are you?".  In Python, there isn‚Äôt a single, definitive PEP governing authentication directly. However, PEP 484 ‚Äì Type Hints, and the broader ecosystem around static typing (mypy) are crucial for building robust authentication systems.  The  module, , and  allow us to define strict schemas for authentication tokens and credentials, enabling compile-time validation and reducing runtime errors.  CPython‚Äôs internal mechanisms for object identity () and hashing are fundamental to secure token generation and comparison.  The standard library‚Äôs  provides cryptographic hashing algorithms, but relying solely on it for authentication is rarely sufficient; dedicated libraries like  are essential for secure key management and encryption.FastAPI Request Handling:  In a high-throughput API, authentication is typically handled via JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) passed in the  header.  We use a custom FastAPI dependency to extract, verify, and decode the JWT, attaching the user identity to the request context.  Performance is critical here; JWT verification must be fast to avoid latency spikes.Async Job Queues (Celery/RQ): As demonstrated by the incident above, authenticating tasks submitted to an asynchronous queue is vital.  We now sign task payloads with a HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) using a rotating secret key, verifying the signature before deserialization.Type-Safe Data Models (Pydantic):  When receiving data from external sources (e.g., user uploads, API calls), Pydantic models are used to define the expected schema. Authentication credentials are often embedded within these models, and validation ensures that only authorized data is processed.  For command-line tools interacting with sensitive resources, we employ API keys or OAuth 2.0 tokens.  These credentials are stored securely (e.g., using ) and used to authenticate requests to a backend service.ML Preprocessing Pipelines:  Data pipelines often require access to sensitive data. Authentication is used to control access to data sources and ensure that only authorized users can train or deploy models.
  
  
  Integration with Python Tooling
Our  reflects our commitment to static typing and code quality:We use FastAPI‚Äôs dependency injection system to manage authentication.  A custom middleware extracts the JWT, and a dependency validates it.  This separation of concerns makes testing easier and improves code readability.  Runtime hooks, like signal handlers, are used to refresh JWTs before they expire.This example demonstrates a dependency injection pattern for authentication.  The  function is a dependency that extracts and validates the JWT, returning the user ID.  This pattern promotes reusability and testability.
  
  
  Failure Scenarios & Debugging
A common failure is incorrect JWT verification due to a mismatched secret key or algorithm.  This often manifests as a .  Debugging involves:  Detailed logging of the JWT payload and verification process.  Stepping through the  function to inspect the token and key.  Analyzing the full traceback to identify the source of the error. Adding assertions to verify the expected format and content of the JWT.Another issue is race conditions in asynchronous authentication.  If multiple requests attempt to authenticate simultaneously, the verification process can become interleaved, leading to incorrect results.  Using appropriate locking mechanisms (e.g., ) can mitigate this risk.  We once encountered a memory leak in a Celery worker due to unclosed database connections within an authentication middleware.   and  were instrumental in identifying the leak.
  
  
  Performance & Scalability
JWT verification is a performance bottleneck.  We‚Äôve optimized this by:  Caching verified JWT payloads in Redis to avoid redundant verification.Asynchronous Verification:  Performing JWT verification asynchronously using .  Minimizing the use of global variables in the authentication process.  Exploring the use of C extensions for cryptographic operations (though the gains are often marginal).Benchmarking with  and asyncio.run(async_benchmark()) is crucial to measure the impact of these optimizations.Insecure deserialization, as experienced in our production incident, is a major risk.  Always validate the authentication token  deserializing any data associated with it.  Avoid using  for untrusted data.  Code injection can occur if user-supplied data is used to construct SQL queries or shell commands.  Use parameterized queries and proper input validation to prevent this.  Privilege escalation can occur if authentication checks are bypassed or if users are granted excessive permissions.  Implement least privilege principles and regularly review access controls.We employ a multi-layered testing strategy:  Testing individual authentication functions and dependencies.  Testing the interaction between authentication and other components (e.g., FastAPI routes, Celery tasks).Property-Based Tests (Hypothesis):  Generating random JWT payloads to test the robustness of the verification process.  Ensuring that all authentication code is type-safe.Our CI/CD pipeline includes: with code coverage reporting. for testing against multiple Python versions.GitHub Actions to run tests and linters on every pull request. hooks to enforce code style and type checking.
  
  
  Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns
Storing Passwords in Plain Text:  Never store passwords directly. Use strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).Using  for Untrusted Data:  As mentioned,  is inherently insecure.  Always verify the  claim in JWTs.Overly Permissive Access Controls:  Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions.Lack of Input Validation:  Validate all user-supplied data to prevent injection attacks.  Never hardcode secrets in your code. Use environment variables or a secrets management system.
  
  
  Best Practices & Architecture
  Use type hints extensively to improve code correctness and maintainability.  Separate authentication logic from business logic.  Assume that all user input is malicious.  Break down authentication into small, reusable components.  Use a layered configuration system to manage secrets and settings.  Use dependency injection to improve testability and flexibility.  Automate testing, linting, and deployment.  Use Docker or other containerization technologies to ensure reproducible builds.  Document all authentication code thoroughly.Authentication is a complex and critical aspect of modern Python systems.  Mastering the nuances of authentication, from secure token generation to robust validation and performance optimization, is essential for building reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications.  Prioritize static typing, rigorous testing, and a security-first mindset.  Refactor legacy code to address potential vulnerabilities, measure performance to identify bottlenecks, and continuously improve your authentication practices.  The cost of a security breach far outweighs the effort required to build a secure authentication system.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Day 9/100: While Loops with Real-World Examples</title><link>https://dev.to/therahul_gupta/day-9100-while-loops-with-real-world-examples-528f</link><author>Rahul Gupta</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 12:22:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to  of the  series!

  Introduction: Why Neural Networks Matter
Have you ever wondered how Netflix recommends your next binge-worthy series? Or how voice assistants like Siri or Alexa understand your commands? The magic behind these smart systems lies in ‚Äîa core component of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning.Neural networks are not just a buzzword in tech circles. They‚Äôre the backbone of facial recognition, fraud detection, chatbots, self-driving cars, and even medical diagnosis. In this blog, we‚Äôll explore what neural networks are, how they work, and why they‚Äôre so powerful‚Äîall in simple, non-intimidating language.
  
  
  üß† What Is a Neural Network?
A  is a computational model inspired by the human brain. Just like your brain uses neurons to process information, neural networks use  (also called nodes) to recognize patterns and make decisions.Imagine it as a web of interconnected nodes that take inputs, perform calculations, and produce outputs. These networks learn from data‚Äîmeaning they can  as they see more examples.
  
  
  üîÑ Real-Life Analogy: Neural Networks as Decision-Making Recipes
Let‚Äôs say you're teaching a child to recognize apples. You show them 10 different apples and say, ‚ÄúThese are apples.‚Äù Over time, the child starts identifying apples based on color, shape, or texture.Neural networks do the same thing but with numbers. Feed them enough labeled images, and they‚Äôll ‚Äúlearn‚Äù the characteristics of an apple without being explicitly programmed. This process is called .
  
  
  üß± Anatomy of a Neural Network
A typical neural network has three types of layers:Receives raw data (e.g., image pixels, sound waves, or text).The ‚Äúthinking‚Äù layers. Each neuron processes input and passes it to the next layer. These layers extract meaningful features from the data.Gives the final prediction (e.g., "apple" or "not apple").Each neuron applies a , adds a , and then passes the result through an  (like ReLU or Sigmoid) to decide what to "fire" forward.
  
  
  ‚öôÔ∏è How Neural Networks Learn: Backpropagation and Training
Training a neural network is like fine-tuning a guitar. You start with random settings (weights), play a note (make a prediction), listen to how off it sounds (calculate error), and then adjust the strings (update weights) using  and .This cycle continues until the network gets really good at making accurate predictions. The more data you feed it, the smarter it becomes.
  
  
  üí° Types of Neural Networks (And What They‚Äôre Good At)
Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)Basic tasks like classificationConvolutional Neural Network (CNN)Image recognition, computer visionRecurrent Neural Network (RNN)Time-series data, language modelingLSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)Text generation, translationGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs)Image generation, deep fakes
  
  
  üöÄ Real-World Applications of Neural Networks
: Predicting diseases from X-rays or ECGs: Fraud detection, algorithmic trading: Personalized recommendations, inventory forecasting: Music composition, movie recommendations: Object detection, path planning
  
  
  üß© Challenges of Neural Networks
Despite their power, neural networks have limitations:: They require lots of labeled dataComputationally Expensive: Training deep networks can take hours or even days: Hard to interpret how they make decisions: They may memorize data instead of learning patternsBut with techniques like , , and , many of these challenges are being actively addressed.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Transposer: A Lightweight, Training-Free Neural Architecture That Learns from Raw Embeddings Without Attention</title><link>https://dev.to/lumgenlab/transposer-a-lightweight-training-free-neural-architecture-that-learns-from-raw-embeddings-39h3</link><author>LumGenLab</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 10:08:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the current landscape of artificial intelligence, most breakthroughs in language understanding rely on scaling ‚Äî larger models, bigger datasets, more compute.

From handling payments and messaging to ordering food and booking rides, these all-encompassing applications strive to be indispensable tools in users' daily lives. However, the sheer volume of services and user interactions within a Super App presents both a challenge and an immense opportunity: how to prevent information overload and deliver truly relevant experiences. This is where Artificial Intelligence (AI) and hyper-personalization become not just features, but foundational pillars in successful Super App development.AI acts as the intelligent backbone, processing vast amounts of user data, predicting needs, and automating interactions. Personalization, powered by AI, translates these insights into tailored experiences, making each user feel like the app was designed just for them. This synergy is crucial for transforming a collection of services into a cohesive, intuitive, and highly engaging digital ecosystem. This blog post will explore the pivotal role of AI and personalization in Super App development, highlighting how they elevate user experience, drive engagement, and unlock new value for businesses.1. AI as the Engine for Data Processing and Predictive AnalyticsAt its core, a Super App generates an enormous amount of data from diverse user interactions across various services. This includes transaction history, search queries, location data, communication patterns, Browse behavior, and more. Without a sophisticated mechanism to process and interpret this data, it remains a raw, untapped resource. This is where AI steps in as the indispensable engine.AI-powered algorithms, particularly machine learning (ML) models, can:Process Massive Datasets: Rapidly analyze vast volumes of structured and unstructured data in real-time, far exceeding human capacity.Identify Complex Patterns: Uncover subtle correlations and trends within the data that indicate user preferences, habits, and future intentions.Enable Predictive Analytics: Based on historical data and real-time inputs, AI can predict user needs, likely actions, and even potential pain points. For example, an AI might predict a user's need for a ride based on their calendar events and location, or suggest a restaurant based on past orders and current time.This predictive capability is a game-changer for Super App development solutions. Instead of users having to actively search for services, the app can proactively offer relevant options, streamlining their experience. For instance, if a user frequently orders coffee from a specific cafe in the morning, an AI agent could prompt them with an option to reorder as they approach their usual time. This seamless, almost clairvoyant interaction significantly enhances convenience and makes the Super App feel truly intelligent and helpful. The ability of AI to derive actionable insights from multi-service data is what elevates a Super App from a mere collection of mini-apps to a truly integrated and intelligent ecosystem.2. Personalization: Tailoring the Super App ExperienceWhile AI provides the analytical power, personalization is the user-facing outcome. In a Super App, personalization moves beyond simple "recommended for you" lists to a dynamic adaptation of the entire app experience. This level of customization ensures that despite the app's vast functionalities, it feels intuitive and relevant to each individual.Key aspects of personalization driven by AI in Super Apps include:Dynamic UI/UX Customization: The layout and visibility of mini-apps and features can change based on a user's most frequent activities, time of day, or location. For example, food delivery might be prominent during lunch hours, while payment options become central during bill payment cycles.Contextual Recommendations: AI leverages contextual data (time, location, weather, past behavior) to offer highly relevant suggestions, whether for shopping, entertainment, or financial services.Personalized Content and Notifications: Delivering news feeds, promotions, or notifications that are specifically tailored to a user's interests and previous interactions, reducing notification fatigue and increasing engagement.Adaptive Search and Discovery: AI can refine search results and make it easier for users to discover new services or features within the Super App that align with their inferred needs.This granular level of personalization ensures that the user never feels overwhelmed by the multitude of options. Instead, they experience a streamlined interface that anticipates their needs, making navigation effortless and delightful. This is a core benefit of Super App architecture combined with intelligent systems. A Super App Development Company places a strong emphasis on designing user interfaces that can fluidly adapt based on AI-driven personalization.3. AI-Powered Virtual Assistants and ChatbotsThe integration of AI-powered virtual assistants and advanced chatbots is another critical role of AI in Super App development.

  So you've decided to create your own server for a Supercell game and Python caught your eye. Among countless questionable projects, you stumbled upon PySupercell Core. What now?
Supercell games (Clash of Clans, Brawl Stars etc.) share similar architecture‚Äîthey‚Äôre built on a core (server foundation). PySupercell Core (PSC) is a fresh Python core that:Implements Supercell‚Äôs base server architectureEasily adapts to any SC gameBut isn‚Äôt a ready-made server‚Äîyou‚Äôll write the logic yourselfMost other Python servers/cores are slow and outdated. PSC is fast and user-friendlygit clone https://github.com/REtard-1337/pysupercell-core

Navigate to  and find logic_magic_message_factory.py
Here  is Clash of Clans' codename. Swap it for your game:Open  and set game parameters. Example for Brawl Stars v52.13.77:Now your server seems ready... but when you launch it...‚Äî Wait, why is the client stuck at "Connecting to server..."? That means PSC is broken!!!
‚Äî Nope, it works! PSC is a , not a full server. You must implement all packets yourselfLet‚Äôs take  as an example. Create logic/messages/auth/login_message.pyBut this seems complicated, so let‚Äôs break it down.Then create  class‚Äîit  inherit from : is the base class for all packets. It provides  (like Classic-Brawl‚Äôs Reader/Writer) Initialize fields in the constructor:Fascinating! But what about server responses?
Create  next to :Not much to explain‚Äîsince this is a , we implement  using fields from the constructorNotice no , , or  in message classes? Supercell uses a different approach‚Äîall packets are handled via MessageManager.receive_message
Example for :What‚Äôs happening?

  Hono and Django now available on Diploi
There are two powerful new additions to Diploi,  and !These frameworks are now officially supported, meaning you can deploy, host, and manage full applications with Hono or/and Django with one clickis a small, simple, and ultrafast web framework built on Web Standards. It works on any JavaScript runtime: Cloudflare Workers, Fastly Compute, Deno, Bun, Vercel, Netlify, AWS Lambda, Lambda@Edge, and Node.js.Hono is mainly used for backend applications, like APIs, proxy servers, edge apps, and typical servers, but that's not all, it can also serve HTML and UI components, so it is appropiate to think of Hono as a fullstack framework. You can think of Hono as a modern alternative to Express, which supports Typescript and can be used with the most popular runtimes availableHono aims to make your life easier by enabling API Spec and type inference via Hono's RPC, which transforms how you can share types and API expected responses between server and client, into a smooth experience. Additionally, Hono has multiple helpers and middlewares to handle typical operations, like managing Cookies, JWT, Webhooks, authentication, and headers, so you don't need external libraries to handle these actionsDjango is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It‚Äôs free and open source.In simpler terms, Django is a framework for building web applications, and it is mostly considered a backend framework because it features ORM, auth, middleware, and other typical backend features, but it can also serve HTML and handle frontend templating just like fullstack frameworks, so it is fair to think that Django is whatever you need it to be üòÖDjango uses a pattern they call Model-View-Template (MVT), which is similar to Model-View-Controller (MVC), with their main difference being that in MVT, the View and Controller from MVC are technically bundled together into the View from MVTFun fact: Before this blog, I didn't know that Django has been around since 2005... damn ü´°
  
  
  Using Django and Hono with other frameworks in Diploi
If you would like to test out how these frameworks work together with other frameworks, you can use Diploi to create monorepo applications, where you can for example, have Django as your backend and Astro in the frontend, or Hono as your API server with a Next.js fullstack app, or any other combination of frameworks and databases that fits your requirementsDiploi will then start a remote development environment that allows you to code in the browser and your application is deployed online. If you would like to start your application with a GitHub repository, all you need to do is register using GitHub and you will be able to start a new repository with your new applicationWhat frameworks should we support next?

The secret sauce is often a data structure called the Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM-Tree) and its core component, the Sorted String Table (SSTable).In this post, we‚Äôll build a toy, educational SSTable-based storage engine in Python, inspired by Martin Kleppmann‚Äôs Designing Data-Intensive Applications. We‚Äôll start simple and gradually add complexity, so you can follow along even if you‚Äôre new to storage internals!An  is a file format for storing large, sorted key-value pairs on disk. The key properties are:: All keys are stored in order, making range queries and binary search possible.: Once written, SSTables are never modified. New data is written to new files.: By combining in-memory and on-disk structures, SSTables enable fast writes and reasonably fast reads.SSTables are the backbone of LSM-Trees, which power many modern databases.: An in-memory, sorted key-value store.: Writes sorted key-value pairs to disk as an SSTable, with a sparse index and Bloom filter.: Reads from SSTables using the index and Bloom filter.: Orchestrates the LSM-Tree logic, combining memtable and SSTables.: A simple Bloom filter for fast negative lookups.: A UNIX socket server exposing set/get operations.: A CLI client to interact with the server.: A script to stress test the system.
  
  
  Step 1: The Memtable ‚Äì Fast In-Memory Writes
When you write data, it first lands in the ‚Äîa sorted, in-memory structure. In our Python version, we use a sorted list and the  module for efficient lookups and inserts.When the memtable gets too big, we  it to disk as a new SSTable.
  
  
  Step 2: Writing SSTables ‚Äì Persistence and Order
Flushing the memtable means writing all its sorted key-value pairs to a file. But how do we make reads efficient?: Every Nth key and its file offset are written to an index file. This lets us quickly jump to the right part of the SSTable.: A probabilistic data structure that tells us if a key is  in the file, saving unnecessary disk reads.

  
  
  Step 3: Reading SSTables ‚Äì Fast Lookups
When you want to read a key: (fastest). for each SSTable (quickly skip files that don‚Äôt have the key). to jump to the right spot in the SSTable file and scan for the key.

  
  
  Step 4: The LSM-Tree ‚Äì Orchestrating Everything
The  class manages the memtable, SSTable files, and the index cache. It handles:: Write to memtable, flush to SSTable when full.: Check memtable, then SSTables from newest to oldest.

  
  
  Step 5: Server and CLI ‚Äì Putting It All Together
We expose our storage engine via a simple UNIX socket server (). You can interact with it using the CLI ():python  sstable_server   
python  main mykey 123
python  main get mykey
How does it perform? The  script:Inserts 1000 random key-value pairsReads them all back and prints the sum and average

Your workers could be on fire, stuck in an endless queue, and you'd be the one to blame here. where we're staring at logs hoping to divine the health of our distributed systems. Time to set up some proper monitoring.Celery is one way of doing distributed task processing, but it's opaque when it comes to observability. You can see logs, but logs don't tell you if workers are healthy, how long tasks are taking, or whether your queue is backing up. That's where Flower comes in, it's the one of the monitoring tools for Celery environments.This guide covers integrating Flower with Prometheus and Grafana to get proper metrics-driven monitoring. Whether you're using Grafana Cloud, self-hosted Grafana, the k8s-monitoring Helm chart, or individual components, we'll walk through the setup, explain why each piece matters, and tackle the gotchas.Kubernetes cluster with Celery workers already runningSome form of Prometheus-compatible metrics collection (Alloy, Prometheus Operator, plain Prometheus, etc.)Grafana instance (cloud or self-hosted)Basic Kubernetes knowledgePatience for the inevitable configuration mysteries
  
  
  Understanding the Architecture
Before diving into configuration, let's understand what we're building. Flower sits between your Celery workers and your monitoring system. It connects to your message broker (Redis/RabbitMQ), watches worker activity, and exposes metrics in Prometheus format.The flow looks like this:Celery workers process tasks from the brokerFlower monitors the broker and worker activityFlower exposes metrics at  endpointYour metrics collector (Prometheus/Alloy) scrapes these metricsGrafana visualizes the dataThe key insight is that Flower doesn't directly monitor workers, it monitors the broker's state and worker events, which is why it can give you a complete picture of your distributed system.
  
  
  The Setup: Flower with Prometheus Metrics
Here's the thing about Flower, it's great at showing you pretty graphs in its web UI, but getting it to export metrics for Prometheus requires a specific flag that's easy to miss. By default, Flower only exposes basic Python process metrics, which are useless for understanding your Celery workload.
  
  
  Deploy Flower (the Right Way)
That  flag is doing the heavy lifting here. Without it, you'll get basic Python process metrics (memory usage, GC stats, etc.) but none of the Celery-specific goodness like worker status, task counts, or queue depths. This flag tells Flower to export its internal monitoring data in Prometheus format.The broker URL needs to match exactly what your Celery workers are using. Flower connects to the same broker to observe worker activity and task flow. If there's a mismatch, Flower won't see your workers.The named port () is crucial for ServiceMonitor configurations later. Many monitoring setups rely on port names rather than numbers for service discovery, making your configuration more resilient to port changes.
  
  
  Metrics Collection: Choose Your Adventure
How you get these metrics into your monitoring system depends entirely on your infrastructure setup. Kubernetes monitoring has evolved into several different patterns, each with its own tradeoffs.
  
  
  Option 1: ServiceMonitor (Prometheus Operator/k8s-monitoring)
ServiceMonitors are part of the Prometheus Operator ecosystem and provide declarative configuration for scrape targets. They're the cleanest approach if you're using Prometheus Operator or the k8s-monitoring Helm chart.The critical detail here is  vs . ServiceMonitors reference the service's port definition, not the container port directly. This indirection allows you to change container ports without updating monitoring configs.Getting this configuration right requires the same attention to detail as any other infrastructure code.One character difference can mean the difference between working monitoring and hours of debugging.Here, the  restricts which namespaces this ServiceMonitor applies to. Without it, the ServiceMonitor tries to find matching services across all namespaces, which can cause confusion in multitenant clusters.
  
  
  Option 2: Prometheus Annotations
If you're using vanilla Prometheus with annotation based discovery, you configure scraping through service annotations. This is simpler but less flexible than ServiceMonitors.The annotations tell Prometheus to scrape this service. Your Prometheus configuration needs to include a job that discovers services with these annotations. This approach is more straightforward but offers less control over scraping behavior.
  
  
  Option 3: Alloy Configuration (Manual)
Grafana Alloy offers more flexibility than traditional Prometheus. You can configure complex discovery and relabeling rules to handle dynamic environments.This configuration discovers pods with the  label, applies relabeling rules to construct proper scrape targets, and forwards metrics to your storage backend. The relabeling rules transform Kubernetes metadata into the format Prometheus expects.
  
  
  Option 4: Static Prometheus Config
For simple setups or development environments, static configuration is the most straightforward approach.This hardcodes the service endpoint, which works fine for stable environments but doesn't handle dynamic scaling or service changes gracefully.
  
  
  Verification: Making Sure It Actually Works
Before diving into dashboard creation, verify that metrics are flowing correctly. This saves hours of troubleshooting later when you're wondering why your graphs are empty.
  
  
  Check the Metrics Endpoint
kubectl port-forward svc/flower-service 5555:5555
curl http://localhost:5555/metrics
You should see metrics that look like this:flower_worker_online{worker="celery@worker-1"} 1.0
flower_events_total{task="process_data",type="task-sent"} 127.0
flower_worker_number_of_currently_executing_tasks{worker="celery@worker-1"} 3.0
flower_task_prefetch_time_seconds{task="process_data",worker="celery@worker-1"} 0.001
If you're only seeing basic Python metrics (python_gc_objects_collected_total, process_resident_memory_bytes, etc.), you're missing the  flag. The Celery-specific metrics are what make this whole exercise worthwhile.
  
  
  Check Your Monitoring System
The verification process depends on your monitoring setup:For ServiceMonitor setups: Check the Prometheus Operator or Alloy UI for discovered targets. Look for your Flower service in the targets list with status "UP".: Navigate to your Prometheus targets page () and verify the Flower job appears with healthy status.: Check your collector's logs for any scraping errors and verify the target appears in the monitoring system's target list.
  
  
  Understanding the Metrics
Flower exports several categories of metrics, each providing different insights into your Celery system::  tells you which workers are active. flower_worker_number_of_currently_executing_tasks shows current load per worker.:  tracks task lifecycle events (sent, received, started, succeeded, failed). These form the basis for throughput and success rate calculations.: flower_task_runtime_seconds (histogram) shows task execution duration. flower_task_prefetch_time_seconds measures queue wait time.: Various metrics help you understand queue depth and processing patterns.
  
  
  Building Useful Dashboards
Now for the payoff - turning those metrics into actionable insights. The key is building dashboards that help you answer specific operational questions.: "Are my workers running? How many are active?"# Total online workers
sum(flower_worker_online)

# Per-worker status
flower_worker_online
: "How many tasks are we processing? Is throughput increasing?"# Tasks being sent to workers (per second)
rate(flower_events_total{type="task-sent"}[5m])

# Tasks being processed (per second)
rate(flower_events_total{type="task-received"}[5m])
: "Is my queue backing up? How long do tasks wait?"# Tasks currently executing
sum(flower_worker_number_of_currently_executing_tasks)

# Time tasks spend waiting in queue
flower_task_prefetch_time_seconds
: "How long do tasks take? Are they getting slower?"# 95th percentile task duration
histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(flower_task_runtime_seconds_bucket[5m]))

# Median task duration
histogram_quantile(0.50, rate(flower_task_runtime_seconds_bucket[5m]))

  
  
  Dashboard Design Philosophy specifically for celery
Start with high-level health indicators, then provide drill-down capabilities. A good Celery dashboard answers these questions in order:: Are workers running? Is the system processing tasks?: How much work are we doing? Is it increasing or decreasing?: How fast are tasks completing? Are there performance regressions?: Are tasks backing up? Where are the bottlenecks?Real Celery deployments often have specialized workers for different task types. CPU-intensive tasks, I/O-bound tasks, and priority queues all need separate monitoring.Each Flower instance monitors a specific Celery app, giving you granular visibility into different workload types. You'll need separate services and scrape configurations for each instance.This approach lets you set different SLAs and alerting thresholds for different workload types. Your real-time fraud detection tasks might need sub-second response times, while your batch report generation can tolerate longer delays.Flower itself is lightweight, but its resource needs scale with worker count and task frequency. A busy system with hundreds of workers and thousands of tasks per minute will use more memory to track state.For self-hosted setups, configure Grafana to read from your Prometheus instance:This assumes Prometheus and Grafana are in the same cluster. For cross-cluster or external access, you'll need appropriate networking and authentication configuration.Production Flower deployments need proper security controls. Flower's web interface shows detailed information about your task processing, which could be sensitive.Enable basic authentication at minimum:For production systems, consider OAuth integration or running Flower behind an authentication proxy. Celery-exporter provides similar metrics without the web interface overhead. It's purpose-built for Prometheus integration and might use fewer resources than Flower. However, you lose Flower's web interface for ad-hoc investigation.Getting Celery monitoring right requires attention to several key details:The  flag transforms Flower from a simple web interface into a proper metrics exporterYour metrics collection method should match your infrastructure setup and operational preferencesServiceMonitor port configuration matters -  references service ports,  references container portsLabel matching between ServiceMonitors, services, and pods must be exactYour monitoring system's target discovery UI is invaluable for debugging configuration issuesThe setup might seem complicated, but each piece serves a specific purpose in building a robust monitoring system. Once you have this foundation, you can extend it with alerting rules, additional dashboards, and integration with your incident response workflow.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>üò± Spent 3 days chasing a ghost bug?</title><link>https://dev.to/aleksei_aleinikov/spent-3-days-chasing-a-ghost-bug-3imi</link><author>Aleksei Aleinikov</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 07:29:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[üî• Next time: fix it in 3 minutes.A tiny Python feature (since 3.8) turns prints into instant micro-logs ‚Äî no setup, no overhead, pure clarity.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>üêçüí• Think bytearray is just a Python toy?

The aim of the project is to deliver a community resource for all things tech in the Inland Northwest while providing an opportunity for contributes to gain real-world experience in a shared open source project.There is a thriving tech community in Spokane, but many members of our community are disconnected. With multiple tech groups on different platforms, such as meetup and eventbright, there are often events of interest happening that many tech enthusiasts are not aware of. The intent is to have a single resource that includes local tech groups and the events they host.Many developers in our community, especially those earlier in their career, have skills and drive, but haven't had the opportunity to work on a project in a real professional environment. For example, a developer could have great knowledge in coding, but hasn't yet had the first professional job or participated in project with milestones, project planning, code reviews, etc. The Spokane Tech project aims to provide this and give contributes a project they can reference for career development, personal portfolios, interviews, etc. What our project (and webapp) becomes will ultimately be dictated by members of the project and will likely evolve over time. Below are some details of the initial vision.Have a web site that houses groups and events. Events may be manually or automatically added to our site. We will have views that list all the groups and events, as well as detail pages for each group and event. Ideally we'll also have a calendar view that can list all events and perhaps be filterable.Have event requests and suggestions capabilities. Here members can post a suggested events they want to give or have someone else give, and others can up/down vote the event (think reddit or stackoverflow). This can be used to prioritize events base on community interest. This can also serve as a living backlog of event ideas. Add labels to events, such as technical areas (frontend, scripting, ML, etc.) and topic levels (beginner/intermediate/etc.). With labels people can filter event based on interest and other criteria.Build member profiles. With profiles, we can have some basic metrics on things like career level, geographic location, interested and expertise. This data can help provide viability into the overall tech presence in Spokane and help drive event topics and location. This could also be a future resource to make available to local businesses and the community for things like contract work, etc. (There has been some outside interest in this type of resource)The Spokane Tech project was started mostly by members of the Spokane Python User Group (SPUG), so naturally the first version of the website is based on python. In the future the project may be re-created in other languages/frameworks/etc. (such as Golang or Rust) as member interest dictates. This is intended to foster growth, knowledge-sharing, and exposure to different tech stacks and methodologies.Interested in participating? Great! Read on...Here are a few things you can do to get started.Look through the open issues and find one that interests you (issues tagged "good first issue" could be great candidates) on githubRead our blog to learn more about the project, follow development and design decisions, and step through the process of building the site. Clone the repo to you machine and run locally, explore the code, break things, fix things, have fun. Step by step instructions are in the CONTRIBUTION doc on github.Have a feature idea or found a bug? Create an issue on github.Need more help or direction?New to python, django, git, webdev? Reach out in the Discord channel and suggest a virtual meet. We'll schedule these on occasion, or as interest dictates.

When an agent fails, our first instinct is to blame its "brain" (the LLM). But the real culprit is often the arsenal we equipped it with‚Äîthe collection of weapons was dull, confusing, or simply not right for the job.In our previous tutorial, LLM Agents are simply Graph ‚Äî Tutorial For Dummies, we revealed that every agent is like a warrior following a simple battle plan: Assess -> Strike -> Repeat. We showed how the 'assessing' happens in a decision node that plans the next move. Now, it's time to forge the weapons used for the .That 'Strike' is powered by the agent's ‚Äîthe official set of weapons, tools, and spells it can draw upon. In technical terms, this is its . This isn't just a list of functions; it is the very soul of your agent's power. A well-forged arsenal, where every blade is sharp and serves a unique purpose, is the difference between an agent that is defeated by the first obstacle and one that conquers any challenge.In this guide, you are the master blacksmith. Using the transparent and powerful  framework as your forge, we will teach you how to craft an arsenal of actions that will turn your agent from a clumsy squire into a legendary warrior.The Battle Tactician: How an Agent Chooses Its WeaponSo, we have an arsenal. But how does the agent, our digital warrior, know when to draw a longsword for a close-quarters fight versus firing a bow from a distance?This critical decision happens in the ‚Äîthe agent's battle tactician. At its core, every agent is just a simple loop that consults its tactician, who then chooses an action from the arsenal. The chosen action is performed, and the results are reported back to the tactician to plan the next move.Visually, the battle plan looks like this: (The Tactician): This is the brain. It analyzes the battlefield (the user's request and current data).The Arrows (The Commands): Based on its analysis, the tactician issues a command: , , or . This is the branch in the graph.The Action Nodes (The Specialists): Each command goes to a specialist soldier who executes that one task.The Loop Back (The Report): After the specialist completes their task, they report back to the tactician with new information, and the cycle begins again."But what magic happens inside that  node?" you ask. "How does it  think?"This is the most misunderstood part of agent design, and the secret is shockingly simple.  There's no complex algorithm, just a carefully written set of instructions for the LLM.The tactician's "brain" is a prompt that looks something like this:### CONTEXT
You are a research assistant. Here is the current situation:
Question: {the user's original question}
Previous Actions: {a log of what has been done so far}
Current Information: {any data gathered from previous actions}

### ARSENAL (Available Actions)
Here are the weapons you can use. Choose one.

[1] search_web
  Description: Search the internet for up-to-date information.
  Parameters:
    - query (str): The specific topic to search for.

[2] write_file
  Description: Save text into a local file.
  Parameters:
    - filename (str): The name of the file to create.
    - content (str): The text content to write into the file.

[3] answer_question
  Description: Provide the final answer to the user.
  Parameters:
    - answer (str): The complete, final answer.

## YOUR NEXT COMMAND
Review the CONTEXT and choose the single best ACTION from your ARSENAL to proceed.
Format your response as a YAML block.
That's it! The agent's entire decision-making process boils down to this: the LLM reads the description of the situation and the "user manual" for every weapon in its arsenal, and then it picks the one that makes the most sense.The quality of its choice is 100% dependent on how clearly you describe its weapons. A sharp, well-defined arsenal in your prompt leads to a smart, effective agent. A vague, confusing one leads to a warrior who brings a knife to a dragon fight.Now, let's learn how to forge these weapons, from simple daggers to god-tier magic spells.Level Up Your Arsenal: The Three Tiers of Weapon ComplexityAs a master blacksmith, you wouldn't forge just one type of weapon. You need a full range, from simple daggers for quick jabs to powerful, enchanted swords for epic battles. The same is true for your agent's arsenal. Actions can be designed with varying levels of power and complexity. Let's explore the three tiers.Level 1: The Simple Dagger (The "Button" Action)A simple dagger is a no-frills weapon. You draw it, you use it. It does one thing, and it does it reliably. These are actions that require .Think of them as on/off switches or simple commands.
An action like  or .In the Arsenal (Prompt Description):[1] request_human_help
  Description: If you are stuck or need clarification, use this action to pause and ask the human user for guidance.

For clear, binary decisions. When the agent needs to signal a state change, like "I'm finished," "I'm stuck," or "I've failed." They are perfect for controlling the overall flow of the battle plan.Level 2: The Sharpshooter's Bow (The Parameterized Tool)A bow is useless without an arrow and a target. This weapon requires input to be effective. These are the most common and versatile actions in an agent's arsenal‚Äîactions that require  to function.To use these weapons, the agent must not only choose the bow but also aim it by providing the correct inputs.
An action like  or send_email(to, subject, body).In the Arsenal (Prompt Description):[2] search_web
  Description: Searches the public internet for a given text string.
  Parameters:
    - query (str): The precise search term to look up. Must be a focused string.

[3] send_email
  Description: Composes and sends an email to a recipient.
  Parameters:
    - to (str): The email address of the recipient.
    - subject (str): The subject line of the email.
    - body (str): The main content of the email.
The Crucial Link to Your Blacksmithing Skills:
How does the agent provide these parameters? This is where your skill in  becomes critical. As we covered in our guide, Structured Output for Beginners, you must instruct the LLM to format its response in a structured way (like YAML or JSON) so your program can easily parse the action  its parameters.Without this skill, you've given your agent a powerful bow but no way to nock an arrow.Level 3: The Spellbook of Creation (The Programmable Action)This is the ultimate weapon: a spellbook that doesn't contain a list of spells but teaches the agent how to . These are  where the agent generates code or complex instructions on the fly.This gives the agent god-like flexibility to solve novel problems you never explicitly trained it for.
An action like  or .In the Arsenal (Prompt Description):[4] execute_sql
  Description: Write and run a SQL query against the company's sales database. The database contains tables named 'customers', 'orders', and 'products'.
  Parameters:
    - sql_query (str): A valid SQL query string to execute.

[5] run_python_code
  Description: Write and execute a sandboxed Python script for complex calculations, data manipulation, or interacting with APIs.
  Parameters:
    - code (str): A string containing the Python code to run.

A spellbook is the most powerful weapon in your arsenal, but it's also the most dangerous. Your agent can solve almost any problem that can be expressed in code. It's no longer limited to pre-defined tools. It's much more likely to make a mistake (e.g., writing buggy code). More importantly, it opens up massive security risks if not handled carefully (e.g., executing malicious code like os.remove("important_file.txt")). Always run such code in a secure, sandboxed environment.Mastering these three tiers allows you to build a balanced and effective arsenal, equipping your agent for any challenge it might face.Forging the Perfect Arsenal: 3 Golden Rules for Your Weapon InventoryA legendary warrior doesn't just carry a random assortment of weapons. Their arsenal is carefully curated‚Äîeach item is perfectly crafted, serves a distinct purpose, and is instantly accessible. As the master blacksmith for your agent, you must apply the same discipline. Here are the three golden rules for forging a world-class action space.Golden Rule #1: Engrave a Crystal-Clear User Manual (Clarity is King)The descriptions for your actions and their parameters are not notes for yourself; they are the . If the manual is vague, the LLM will misuse the tool. Be painfully, relentlessly explicit.A Dull Blade (Bad Description):search: searches for stuff
The agent sees this and thinks, "What stuff? How? What do I provide?" The result is a wild guess, like search(query="who won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics and what were their contributions in detail and also list prior winners"), a query too broad to be effective.A Sharpened Katana (Good Description):search_web(query: str):
  Description: Searches the public internet for up-to-date information on a single, specific topic. Returns the top 5 text snippets.
  Parameters:
    - query (str): A simple and focused search query, typically 3-5 words long.
Now the agent understands its constraints. It knows the tool is for  and the query should be . It will correctly generate a command like search_web(query: "2024 Nobel Prize Physics winner"), leading to a much better outcome.Golden Rule #2: Don't Burden Your Warrior with a Junk Drawer (Keep it Concise)A warrior grabbing a weapon in the heat of battle can't afford to sift through a hundred options. They need a small, elite set of choices. Overwhelming the LLM with too many actions leads to confusion, slower decision-making (more tokens to process), and a higher chance of picking the wrong tool.The Blacksmith's Guideline: An arsenal of 10 weapons is formidable. An arsenal of 100 is a junk drawer.If your action space is growing too large, it's a sign that your tools are too granular. Instead of creating , , and , forge a single, more powerful weapon: . Your code can handle the internal logic of parsing different file types. Keep the agent's choices clean and high-level.Golden Rule #3: Make Every Weapon Unique (Slay Redundancy)Every weapon in the arsenal should have a unique purpose. If the agent has two tools that do similar things, it will get confused about which one to use. This is called a lack of "orthogonality."The Confusing Arsenal (Bad Design):read_csv_from_disk(file_path: str): Reads customer data from a local CSV file.: Queries the live customer database.The agent is asked to "find the total sales for new customers from this quarter." Which tool should it use? The data might be in the CSV, or it might be in the database. The agent doesn't know and might make the wrong choice.The Pro-Gamer Move: Simplify the Battlefield
A true master blacksmith doesn't just forge weapons; they shape the battlefield to their advantage. Instead of giving the agent two ambiguous tools, do the work for it behind the scenes.The Decisive Arsenal (Good Design):
Before the agent even starts, run a script that loads the CSV data into a temporary table in the database.Now, the agent's arsenal is clean and unambiguous:: Queries the customer database, which contains all known customer data.The ambiguity is gone. The agent has one, and only one, tool for retrieving customer data. You've eliminated redundancy and made the agent's decision trivial, guaranteeing it makes the right choice every time.Conclusion: An Agent is Only as Sharp as its ArsenalAnd so, the secrets of the forge are yours. You now understand that the true power of an LLM agent doesn't come from some mysterious, hidden algorithm. It comes from the thoughtful, disciplined, and creative process of crafting its .You've learned that agents are just warriors in a , making decisions based on a prompt that serves as their battle plan. And you've seen how to stock their arsenal for any challenge:  With  for quick, decisive commands.  With  for precise, targeted actions.  With reality-bending  for ultimate flexibility.Most importantly, you now hold the three golden rules of the master blacksmith: Your descriptions are the agent's guide to victory. A curated, concise arsenal is deadlier than a cluttered one. Make every weapon unique to ensure the agent never hesitates.The next time you see a complex agent framework with thousands of lines of code, you won't be intimidated. You'll know to look past the noise and ask the fundamental questions: "What's in the arsenal? How is it described? Is it sharp, concise, and unique?"Armed with this knowledge, you are no longer just a coder; you are an . You have the power to forge not just tools, but intelligent, reliable, and effective digital warriors.Ready to light the forge?

Yes, if you focus on the right ones and use targeted practice. This guide breaks down the six most important data structures for beginner developers, with daily goals, real Python code, and hand-picked problems from LeetCode and HackerRank.Why Learn Data Structures First?What You‚Äôll Learn in 7 DaysFrequently Asked Questions
  
  
  Why Learn Data Structures First?
If you're preparing for coding interviews, struggling to debug slow code, or trying to build real-world projects, learning data structures (DSA) is non-negotiable.Here‚Äôs why developers search for "how to learn DSA fast":Data structures are core to passing FAANG-style interviewsThey help you write faster, more memory-efficient codeThey're the foundation for real systems like compilers, frameworks, and databasesEven frontend developers need them to handle things like UI trees, state management, and algorithm-heavy featuresAnyone learning programming who skipped CS theoryIt‚Äôs designed for clarity, focus, and results in one week.
  
  
  What You‚Äôll Learn in 7 Days
Indexing, memory layout, subarraysPointers, nodes, reverse listsLIFO, FIFO, scheduling logicTraversal, recursion, BST logicPractice, recall, mini project
  
  
  Day 1 ‚Äì Arrays and Strings
: Understand memory layout, indexing, and basic operations.Immutability (for strings in most languages): Learn how to manage nodes and pointers.Insertion/deletion at head/tailSingly vs doubly linked lists
  
  
  Day 3 ‚Äì Stacks and Queues
: Understand LIFO vs FIFO logic and when to use each.Use cases: undo systems, scheduling, recursion: Learn how to store key-value pairs with fast lookups.: Understand hierarchical data and recursive traversal.Binary Tree vs Binary Search Tree (BST)Preorder, Inorder, PostorderRecursion in traversal logic: Learn how to represent and traverse networked data.Graph search and connectivityRevisit questions you got wrong or skippedDraw structures from memory: arrays, trees, linked listsBuild 1 mini project: postfix calculator or CLI parserReflect: what confused you, and what became clear?
  
  
  Frequently Asked Questions

  
  
  What is the best order to learn data structures?
Start with arrays and linked lists, then stacks/queues, then hash maps, followed by trees and graphs. That‚Äôs the order used in most developer job prep tracks.
  
  
  Do frontend developers need to learn data structures?
Yes. You‚Äôll use trees for UI rendering, hash maps for state updates, and stacks/queues for undo features and async tasks.
  
  
  How much DSA do I need to know for interviews?
For most junior-to-mid roles, you‚Äôll need to master arrays, hash maps, linked lists, trees, and recursion. Graphs are optional unless you‚Äôre interviewing at big tech or for algorithm-heavy roles.
  
  
  Which programming language is best for learning data structures?
Python is beginner-friendly and clear. Java, C++, and JavaScript also work ‚Äî but pick one and stick with it for consistency.
  
  
  Should I learn data structures before algorithms?
Yes. Algorithms  data structures. You can‚Äôt implement binary search or DFS if you don‚Äôt know how arrays or graphs work.Code every day, don‚Äôt just readSketch by hand, especially for trees and graphsOne language only, avoid switching mid-practiceIf stuck >15 minutes, review the concept, not the solutionIf this helped, I‚Äôve got more like it.

The smallest QR code (besides micro QR codes) is "version 1" which uses 21x21 pixels.
We'll have to split the squares in half and then use some of the margin.Version 1 QR codes can hold URLs up to 17 bytes long using the lowest
data quality setting. Unfortunately  is 23 bytes
long, so I'll have to improvise. I went with  instead, as this
will prompt many QR code scanners to "search" for the term resulting in my website.Note that a lovely reader informed me shortly after publication that indeed

the  option with  to not include a trailing newline.$ echo -n "HTTPS://SETHMLARSON.DEV" | qr --error-correction=L
I drew the corner squares (known as "position patterns") and then started trying
to scan the QR code as a gradually filled in other pixels. Once I had drawn the
"timing lines" between the top left and bottom left position I could
see that my scanner "wanted" to see something in my drawing.I continued adding the top timing line and data and then the scanner could
start to see the whole square as a QR code. If you look closely I even
made a mistake here in the data a bit, but in the end this didn't matter

the paper was curling up off the flat surface. I could only get the scan to work
when I held the paper flat. However, hanging the QR code from my monitor worked
extremely well, even when scanning from a distance.I hope this inspires you to try hand-drawing something on grid paper üñ§ü§ç

Steps to Develop a RAG Strategy4. How to Develop It (Example Python Code)5. Improving the Code for Better Production ResultsRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method that combines a  with a generative language model.Instead of relying solely on the model‚Äôs internal knowledge, it retrieves relevant information from an external document collection or knowledge base at inference time.This lets the model generate more accurate, context-aware answers grounded in actual data.The model's weights are  ‚Äî it uses external data during the answer generation step.
  
  
  2. Steps to Develop a RAG Strategy
 Collect and preprocess your text data (PDFs, docs, etc.).Split documents into chunks: Break long texts into smaller pieces for efficient retrieval. Convert text chunks into vector embeddings using a sentence transformer model. Use a vector database (e.g., FAISS) to store embeddings for fast similarity search. Embed the user‚Äôs question and search for the most relevant document chunks. Combine retrieved documents and the user query into a prompt. Pass the prompt to a language model to produce a grounded response. Answer questions from product manuals and FAQs. Summarize academic papers or technical documents. Provide information based on legal texts or regulations. Answer questions from textbooks or course materials. Query company documents, reports, or internal wikis.
  
  
  4. How to Develop It (Example Python Code)

  
  
  Creating the embeddings of the PDF and storing on FAISS Vector DB locally

  
  
  Sending embeddings context to AI model for RAG
Once we have the embeddings saved and indexed in FAISS, we can use them to answer user questions more accurately. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre doing here.The function  contains a RAG pipeline that:

1. Loads the local FAISS vector store.2. Finds the most relevant chunks based on the user query.3. Builds a clean prompt that includes the context and the question.4. Sends the prompt to a language model (like Phi-2) via an API.5. Gets back a contextualized answer based only on the document content.
  
  
  5. Improving the Code for Better Production Results
Use stronger language models: Upgrade to larger or more capable models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, or other state-of-the-art LLMs) to get more accurate and coherent answers.Improve embedding quality: Use more powerful embedding models like sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2 or OpenAI‚Äôs embeddings, which can capture semantic meaning better than smaller models. Use more scalable vector databases such as Pinecone, Weaviate, or Elasticsearch for handling larger datasets with faster retrieval times.Context window management: Implement smarter chunking, token budget management, or retrieval filtering to keep prompts concise but informative.Caching and indexing strategies: Use caching for repeated queries and incremental index updates to improve speed and freshness.Monitoring and evaluation: Continuously monitor output quality and user feedback to identify weaknesses and improve iteratively.These steps help make the RAG system more robust, scalable, and suitable for real-world production use cases.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>String in Python (10)</title><link>https://dev.to/hyperkai/string-in-python-10-2p88</link><author>Super Kai (Kazuya Ito)</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 23:40:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[center() can center the string set  as shown below:The 1st argument is (Required-Type:):

Because it's literally everywhere.Python is used in web development, data science, machine learning, automation, and even artificial intelligence. But what is most appealing ‚Äî especially for new developers ‚Äî is how readable it is. The syntax is simple, the learning curve isn't so rough, and some people even joke that it feels like writing in plain English.I started learning JavaScript about ten months ago. Once I honed my fundamentals in JavaScript, I wanted to learn a language that would open more doors and expand my horizon in tech beyond web development. Python kept coming up in conversations ‚Äî not just because it's powerful, but because people actually enjoy using it.
  
  
  Indentation and Variables
Right off the bat, two things will blow your mind about Python ‚Äî especially if you're coming from JavaScript.First, Python uses indentation (whitespace) to define code blocks, rather than curly braces  like in JavaScript and many other languages. That means spacing of your code is very important.Compare that to JavaScript:In Python, there's no need for  ‚Äî the indentation is the structure.Another surprising quirk is how variables are declared. Python doesn't require keywords like , , or . You just write the variable name and assign a value.There's no need to specify types or use extra keywords ‚Äî Python figures it out for you.Lists in Python are similar to arrays in JavaScript ‚Äî they can hold multiple values, are ordered, and are mutable (you can change them).They have a very similar syntax, except that:Python typically uses  to declare variables and JavaScript uses .
Python also introduces another built-in data structure called . At first glance, tuples look a lot like lists ‚Äî they can store an ordered collection of elements ‚Äî but they come with a few key differences:Tuples are  ‚Äî meaning once created, their values cannot be changed.More memory-efficient and faster than lists, especially for large, fixed data sets.
Without the comma, Python will treat it as a plain string or number.Python has a useful set of built-in methods you can use on lists and tuples. List methods such as , , , , , etc., allow efficient ways to manipulate and interact with data.Tuples can also be used in real-world scenarios like coordinates or color values - places where you need fixed, unchanging data:Read more about here.Tuples have fewer methods: mainly  and .
  
  
  Conditional Statements and Logical Operators
Python uses  to handle conditional logic.Logical operators in Python: means both conditions must be true. means at least one must be true. inverts the truth value.

  
  
  For Loop and List Comprehension
Python's  loops are super clean:List comprehensions let you build lists in a single line:Try it yourself: Write a list comprehension that returns all even numbers from 0 to 20.
  
  
  Functions and Lambda Functions
Python functions use the  keyword:Lambda functions are one-liner anonymous functions:You‚Äôll often see lambdas used in sorting, mapping, or filtering lists.While Python has a lot going for it ‚Äî especially its simplicity and readability ‚Äî it's not without tradeoffs.Python tends to run slower than JavaScript in browser-based environments.It's not the best fit for mobile app development.And because it's dynamically typed, it can lead to unexpected bugs if you're not careful with types.But in many cases, these drawbacks are outweighed by Python's ease of use, massive ecosystem, and wide range of applications ‚Äî especially in data science and automation.As with any language, it's about choosing the right tool for the job.This blog isn‚Äôt meant to cover  about Python ‚Äî instead, it‚Äôs a reflection of what stood out to me as a JavaScript developer learning Python for the first time. These are the things I found quirky, interesting, and surprisingly smooth to work with ‚Äî like list comprehensions, lambda functions, and Python‚Äôs indentation-based style.There‚Äôs still  to explore in Python: Modules, Dictionaries, Classes and Object-Oriented Programming, File handling, Error handling‚Ä¶ the list goes on.I‚Äôm still learning, and I plan to write more as I go deeper. But if you‚Äôre curious and want to keep exploring, here are some  that have helped me: ‚Äî The most accurate and comprehensive reference for Python syntax, features, and standard library modules. A bit dense, but essential for in-depth learning. ‚Äî Interactive lessons with a built-in coding environment. Excellent if you prefer to learn by doing.Thanks for reading ‚Äî and if you‚Äôre learning Python too, I‚Äôd love to hear what surprised or confused  the most.

I‚Äôll be posting daily progress and projects!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to create an AI ChatBot and flex in front of your dumb friends</title><link>https://dev.to/souviktests/how-to-create-an-ai-chatbot-and-flex-in-front-of-your-dumb-friends-d76</link><author>Souvik Paul</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 19:38:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, I'll show you how you can create your very own  that can answer all types of questions, and how you can host it for completely free of cost.If you're in college and your friends are dumb, you can flex in front of them.Just kidding, not just flex, you can build any type of personal robot that follows your instructions.To build this, we need 3 things: a place where we can chat, an LLM API to generate answers and a server to run the chatbot.So we use these platforms to build our app:Telegram (Telegram Bot API)OpenRouter/Krutrim Cloud (LLM API)Let's start with Telegram.Open Telegram and go to @BotFather to create your bot.Then, send  to BotFather and write your preferred name and username (the username must include the word 'bot' in it).Now, copy the Telegram API Key.Now open any code editor where you write Python code, and let's start building the bot.Before building the bot, let's grab the main brain. LLM API to generate replies to the messages.For this project, I'm using  model. It works well for me in many cases before; you can try playing around with other models.With a free OpenRouter account, you can call the API . If you're just playing around, you can use it.But if you scale, you can add credits, or if you're from India, you can use  and use the services at scale at a very reasonable price.You can find a lot of models there also.Ok, now just create an API key on  or  and copy the key.Now open the  and install the  package by running !pip install pyTelegramBotAPI command.Open your code editor and paste this code.import telebot
import requests
import json

API_KEY = "<--TELEGRAM BOT API KEY-->"
bot = telebot.TeleBot(API_KEY)

def start_chat(message):
  return True

@bot.message_handler(func=start_chat)
def chat(message):

  print('Typing...')
  bot.send_chat_action(chat_id=message.chat.id, action='typing')

  response = requests.post(
    url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions",
    headers={
      "Authorization": "Bearer <--LLM API KEY-->",
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    data=json.dumps({
      "model": "qwen/qwen3-32b:free",
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": message.text
        },
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are <--BOT NAME-->, created by <--COMPANY NAME--> at <--COMPANY LOCATION-->, by <--DEVELOPER NAME-->, a smart and friendly AI assistant. Always respond in a short, clear, and to-the-point manner. Avoid unnecessary explanations unless asked. Use simple language. Prioritise helpfulness, speed, and clarity. If unsure, say so briefly."
        }
      ],

    })
  )
  data = response.json()
  reply = data['choices'][0]['message']['content']
  reply = reply.replace('**', "")
  bot.send_message(message.chat.id, reply)
  print('Reply sent to '+message.from_user.first_name)

print('AI is running...')

bot.infinity_polling()
This is the code you need for the bot.Change the API keys and system prompt details accordingly. You can also tweak & use different system prompts to do a completely different job as well as I said earlier.Make use of updating the  and  according to the service you use.By now, if you run the code, you'll find your bot working perfectly fine like this.Awesome, now just keep running the server, and when it's running, your bot is also running.Now, to run it 24x7, you can deploy the Python code to any cloud VPS server from any of your preferred hosting companies.You can also rent  CPU and GPU to run your applications and AI models as well.Or if you've an active internet connection in your home, you can use your old Android mobile as a server and it's pretty much do the work pretty well.Just download  and run the Python script there.If you want to SSH your Termux terminal to your computer for development purposes, you can follow this tutorial from  channel.Now connect the phone to the charger, connect to WiFi and just run the Python script.Congratulations on your new .By now, if your friends think you're cool, give me a treat, bro!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hilarious Guide to Python Libraries: Meet the Machine Learning Family üòÇ</title><link>https://dev.to/urvashiagrawaldev/hilarious-guide-to-python-libraries-meet-the-machine-learning-family-4cok</link><author>Urvashi Agrawal</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 19:36:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[üìò CV (Computer Vision) ‚Äî The Memory Book

The issue is that all of these require a bit of code to get your started. For example, assuming you have an API key in your environment like I do, you‚Äôll need at least this code to make an LLM call with OpenAI (also assuming you‚Äôre using the older Chat Completions endpoint).And if you want to wrap your API call with a function so you can call it repeatedly, that‚Äôs even more lines!And that is simply unacceptable!No, I‚Äôm being facetious. For most LLM projects, consistency of output trumps anything else, however sometimes its nice to have a super simple way to add LLMs to my one-off python scripts and tools without all the boilerplate. Magentic is a Python package that lets you create functions that call LLMs in 3 lines of code. No, really! Here‚Äôs an example ripped straight from their docs.Thanks to some black box dark magic that I don‚Äôt feel like learning about, this is a completely valid Python function that‚Äôs callable anywhere in the script, assuming you have an OpenAI API Key in your environment variables.
  
  
  A Note On Package Management
I‚Äôm going to be using the PEP 723 standard at the top of all my scripts for the rest of this post. This allows you to use uv, the best package manager for Python, to run the scripts without you having to make a virtual environment, then install packages, then run the script. This automates all three of those tasks into a single command. Here‚Äôs an example.Here‚Äôs the above script with the added metadata and some slight modifications. This assumes you have uv installed and the  env var set.This script can now be downloaded and ran like an executable. I‚Äôve uploaded to a gist for easy download.wget  dudeify https://gist.githubusercontent.com/chand1012/218372f3e1101dfa7f915dc35c0e66d8/raw/363f720d21fa8ebe2e6a484f6b389496c3452064/dudeify.py
 +x dudeify
./dudeify The first time you run the script it‚Äôll handle making a cached virtual environment for the next time you run it! For more information on how this works, you can check out the uv docs, and the blog post that inspired my constant use of this feature.If you want to have structured outputs, like for example for an API response or just to make it easier to parse and use the data with your scripts, you can use a Pydantic Dataclass.Here‚Äôs an example of that method being ran.
  
  
  Prompting and Function Calls
There‚Äôs two ways you can prompt the LLM with Magentic. You can either use the  decorator, as I‚Äôve been using, which is the simplest and fastest way to create LLM methods. There‚Äôs also , which allows you to pass a list of chat messages to the LLM. This is especially useful for few-shot prompting, where you give the LLM some examples of what output you want. After all, LLMs  just fancy pattern matching black boxes.You can also pass function calls to LLMs to allow them to return a python callable that you can call later. Another use of this is the decorator  which allows you to have an LLM call a function and use the returned results to generate its response.If you‚Äôre a data conscious person, or just want your options to be open, Magentic can be configured to work with nearly all other LLMs as long as they are supported by LiteLLM or offer an OpenAI compatible API. Here‚Äôs an example of a script that runs entirely locally using Ollama and Google‚Äôs Gemma 3.You can use the LiteLLM method to use Anthropic‚Äôs Claude series of models, or you can use Magentic‚Äôs official Anthropic extension.Need an async function? Just prefix with  instead of  !You can use Python‚Äôs  to make multiple simultaneous calls to the LLM.Need to stream the response back to the user? Use Magentic‚Äôs  to loop through the response chunks.This also works for multiple objects, simply wrap your objects in the  class.Working with LLMs is now easier than ever, and Magnetic makes it even easier than the standard methods to quick add LLMs to any Python script, regardless of the scale of complexity. Using this in tandem with something like uv and the new scripting metadata allows you to quickly make command line tools that can utilize AI quickly and effectively. I won‚Äôt always use Magentic for every project I need an LLM for, but I‚Äôll definitely use it all the time with my small one-offs and utilities.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Set Up a Django Project Structure Using VS Code</title><link>https://dev.to/annnab2222/how-to-set-up-a-django-project-structure-using-vs-code-3189</link><author>Hannah</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 18:55:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you're just getting started with Django and want to build your project using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), you're in the right place.

Before l dive in, make sure you have the following installed:üìÅ Step 1: Create Your Project Folder.
Open VS Code and create a new folder;`mkdir my_django_project

Virtual environments are essential in Python development‚Äîespecially for Django projects. Each Python project might require different versions of packages. A virtual environment keeps dependencies isolated so that one project‚Äôs requirements don‚Äôt interfere with another‚Äôs.
we need to Create and activate a virtual environment;python -m venv env
# On Windows
env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source env/bin/activate
üì¶Step 3: Install Django.
Once your virtual environment is activated, the next step is to install Django ‚Äî the powerful web framework that will power your project.
Install Django using pip;After install it look like this;then after that run the server python manage.py runserverthen it click the link and it brings success of install of django üöÄStep 4: Start a New Django ProjectNow create your Django project`django-admin startproject <project_name>`

  Day Four of My Django Bootcamp: Crafting the Structure of My Django Project
Today is the fourth day of my Django bootcamp, and it has been an exciting journey so far! I focused on creating and structuring my Django project while learning a lot about apps, templates, and URL configurations. Here‚Äôs a friendly walkthrough of how I accomplished it using Git Bash as my terminal.1. Starting the Django Project üöÄ
The first step was to create a new Django project named . This project would serve as the foundation for everything else. Using Git Bash, I navigated to my desired directory and set up a virtual environment:dijango
dijango
python  venv venv
venv/bin/activate  
venvcriptsctivate   Next, I installed Django and created the project:pip django
django-admin startproject dijango Here‚Äôs what the structure looked like at this point:: The project‚Äôs control center.: A directory containing core files like , , and others. üõ†Ô∏è
Django encourages splitting functionality into smaller units called apps. I created two apps,  and , to separate different functionalities:python manage.py startapp REE1
python manage.py startapp REE2
Each app came with its own files, like  and . To make Django recognize these apps, I added them to the  section in :Templates define how the front-end of the app looks. Using Git Bash, I created a  directory in the root folder and added subfolders for each app:templates
templates/REE1
templates/REE2
In , I updated the  configuration to include the new directory:URL configurations connect specific views to URLs. Since Django doesn‚Äôt create  files for apps by default, I manually added them for  and .I then updated the main project‚Äôs  to include these app-specific routes:5. Adding Views and Templates üñºÔ∏è
In Django, views determine what gets displayed for each URL. I created simple views for both apps:Next, I added basic HTML templates:templates/REE1/index.html:REE1 IndexWelcome to REE1!:REE2 HomeWelcome to REE2!Using Git Bash throughout this process made it easy to execute commands and navigate between directories. As I continue exploring Django, I look forward to building more complex projects and honing my skills. If you‚Äôre on a similar journey, let‚Äôs connect and share our progress!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Come along for 20 days of deep Django learning experience with me</title><link>https://dev.to/nyambura20/come-along-for-20-days-of-deep-django-learning-experience-with-me-4efa</link><author>Sarah Nyambura Kiiru</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 18:19:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[: How I understood and practiced about the structure of Django
The first thing is to understand what a structure is.is the organized way in which parts of something are arranged or built.It helps one to understand where things belong and maintain one's project as it grows helping in collaboration without confusion.To be able to have a project structured in the Django style you run the following command to start the project.django-admin startproject <project_name>
This is how the project structure will look like afterwards:my_project/
    manage.py 
    my_project/
 - It is a command-line utility used to runserver, migrations etc (directory with the same name as your project) - This directory contains the project-wide settings and configurations. The files it contained are as below:my_project/
    __init__.py
    settings.py
    urls.py
    asgi.py

 - This empty file tells Python to treat the directory as a package. It's necessary for importing files across different modules something you'll do a lot in Django projects. - Contains all the configuration settings for your Django project, such as installed apps, middleware, database settings, static file paths, and more. - Acts as the "table of contents" for your site. It defines how URLs are routed to views ‚Äî basically deciding what happens when someone visits a specific page. - Entry point for ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface), which allows your Django app to support asynchronous features like WebSockets and background tasks. -     Entry point for WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface), which helps traditional web servers like Gunicorn or uWSGI serve your Django project. This is what powers your site in most production environments. Something to note is to ensure you have created a virtual environment in VS code so as to start the django project
You need to run the server so that to make sure the project runs(a rocket like thing will be displayed in the browser to confirm that)python manage.py runserver
In order to get to practice on the django structure I created two applications for my day1 learning of django:  and  apps 
To be able to create the apps I used:python manage.py startapp journal
python manage.py startapp about 
Each app contains files and a folder which are: - Configuration for the Django admin interface. - Configuration for the app itself. - Contains the database models for the app. - Contains tests for the app. - Contains the request/response logic for the app. - Contains database migrations for the app. Then I registered the 2 apps in the  file For the 2 apps I created a folder templates for each.For the about app the template folder contained an about folder that has an  file
   For the journal app the template folder contained an journal folder that has an  filein the settings.py had to tell Django where to find the template: BASE_DIR / ,Then routed the URL so that the templates to be visible in the browser
I did this by creating file for each app and linking it from  file of each app For The whole project URL fileI then started the developer server 
and used this link for me to get results http://127.0.0.1:8000/journal/diary_entries/
http://127.0.0.1:8000/about/about_me/My project about creating a diary was complete I had some challenges but got through but did not stop me from proceeding.
This diary apps enabled me to get to understand how the Django structure works.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Introducing the Three Versions of TextCleaner: free , pro, and Pro Enhanced</title><link>https://dev.to/nova_soft_d42c9d58573e2a4/introducing-the-three-versions-of-textcleaner-free-pro-and-pro-enhanced-152h</link><author>Nova Soft</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 18:06:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I‚Äôm excited to introduce the different versions of TextCleaner, a Python-based desktop tool designed to clean messy text files by removing HTML tags, emojis, weird symbols, and more.Here‚Äôs a quick overview of the three editions:Removes HTML tags, emojis, and strange charactersNo installation needed ‚Äî just run the .exeIncludes all Lite featuresAdds advanced cleaning options like regex supportAllows batch processing of multiple filesAll Standard features plus:In-depth text analysis and comparison toolsCustomizable cleaning workflowsSupports Arabic and multiple languagesFeel free to try any version that fits your needs!

However, how you start your Django project can significantly impact its scalability, maintainability, and performance. This guide provides a comprehensive, step-by-step walkthrough to help you start your Django project the right way, ensuring a solid foundation for success and also tries to explain the project settings and configurations.project structure in django is designed to support the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern, which is Django‚Äôs version of the traditional Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework.I created a folder on my desktop to hold my project and named it "WASTE SOTOR".I create a virtual enviroment, since am on windows i used,This creates a folder named env that will store all project-specific Python packages. 
Later i had to activate the enviroment using;This is an image after i have created and activated the virtual enviroment it created a folder named env.This is are the folders that are created after installing Django, they are created on the env folder.Start a project
I used this since i wanted my project to be called waste_sorter ;django-admin startproject waste_sorter This are the project settings and configurations installed.checking if my project was working
I had to run my project using;python manage.py runserver
follow the link provide and you should see this;1.init.py- Makes the folder a Python package .
2.settings.py-Contains all configurations: database, apps, templates, static files, etc.
3.urls.py-Controls which page shows whatand also connects URLs to views.
4.asgi.py-Used for advanced or real-time features and also handles asynchronous requests.
5.wsgi.py-Used to connect Django to a web server and handles normal (synchronous) requests.In this case i started my app and i had 2 of them  using  the command;python manage.py startapp app_name
here is an image both apps i created;admin.py: Configuration for the Django admin interface.apps.py: Configuration for the app itself. models.py: Contains the database models for the app.tests.py: Contains tests for the app.views.py: Contains the request/response logic for the app.migrations/: Contains database migrations for the app.

so that my apps could be recognized ,i opened the settings.py and added the apps on the INSTALLED_APPS.
  
  
  writing views and creating urls
this are the codes that i wrote, i had two since the apps are two;
  
  
  Step 7 created Urls for both apps
I created new files and made them "urls.py" under each app.
This is where i had to join bothof the urls that i created to the main project.
This is what it looked like;Adding Templates 
This this the folder that shall be kholding all my pages.
Example of one of my pages ;Checking if the project is Running ;
i used thepython manage.py runserver

Don't forget to follow me on Medium and show your support. Thank you! Your support means the world! Efficient machine learning inference separates promising prototypes from production-ready systems. I've spent years wrestling with latency spikes and resource constraints across edge devices, cloud instances, and embedded systems. These eight Python techniques consistently deliver performance gains while preserving accuracy.  Model quantization reduces numerical precision to shrink memory footprint. Converting 32-bit floats to 16-bit or 8-bit integers accelerates calculations with minimal accuracy loss. In one deployment, this cut inference time by 60% on mobile processors. Here's practical TensorFlow implementation:Pruning eliminates redundant neural connections. I approach this as iterative sculpting - gradually removing low-weight connections during training. Sparsity patterns emerge naturally, like finding efficient pathways through dense forests:Batching strategies maximize hardware utilization. Grouping requests leverages parallel processing capabilities. I implement dynamic batching that adapts to fluctuating loads:ONNX Runtime provides hardware-agnostic acceleration. Switching execution providers lets me optimize for specific environments. This snippet shows how I configure sessions for different hardware:Apache TVM compiles models to hardware-native code. Ahead-of-time compilation generates optimized executables. I use this for deploying to edge devices with limited resources:Asynchronous pipelines separate I/O from computation. This design pattern overlaps preprocessing with model execution. My implementation handles concurrent requests efficiently:Knowledge distillation transfers capabilities to smaller models. I train compact student models using guidance from larger teacher models. This technique maintains accuracy while reducing computational demands:Monitoring production systems detects performance degradation. Statistical tests identify data drift and model decay. I implement continuous validation with this approach:These techniques form a comprehensive toolkit for inference optimization. Each addresses specific constraints I've encountered in real-world deployments. Quantization excels on mobile processors, while TVM shines in cross-compilation scenarios. Asynchronous patterns prove invaluable in high-throughput APIs, and distillation creates efficient specialized models. Performance monitoring completes the lifecycle, ensuring sustained accuracy.  The most effective solutions combine multiple approaches. I typically start with quantization and pruning during model export, then layer hardware-specific optimizations like TVM compilation. For server deployments, I implement batching and asynchronous pipelines. Edge deployments benefit most from quantization and TVM. Continuous monitoring provides safety nets for all scenarios.  
  
  
  Through careful implementation, I've achieved latency reductions up to 85% compared to baseline implementations. Resource consumption often drops to one-third of original requirements. These gains enable applications previously considered impractical - real-time video analysis on IoT devices, high-frequency trading predictions, and responsive medical diagnostics. The Python ecosystem provides robust tools, but thoughtful architecture determines ultimate performance.

As a developer who loves a good retro arcade game and is curious about AI-driven development, this was the perfect excuse to dive in. The mission was simple: build a game using Amazon Q's command-line interface, document the journey, and share the results.The result? A fully-functional, nostalgic side-scrolling shooter called , and a ton of insights into pairing AI with a classic coding project. Here‚Äôs how it went down.
  
  
  My Game: "Space Conquer" - A Modern-Classic Shooter
For my project, I chose to build , a side-scrolling space shooter inspired by the classic  from old Nokia phones. Like many, I have fond memories of playing . I wanted to capture that simple, addictive fun but with a modern coat of paint‚Äîbetter graphics, dynamic sound, and smoother controls. A 2D shooter involves a fantastic mix of programming challenges that are perfect for an AI assistant: managing game states, handling real-time user input, collision detection, and creating varied enemy behaviors. I didn't just want to build a game; I wanted to build a . My vision was a modular design where new enemies, power-ups, or levels could be added easily. This is where an AI's ability to generate structured, boilerplate code would really shine.Space Conquer features diverse enemies, collectible power-ups, dynamic audio that changes with the game state, and even a hidden developer panel for testing.
  
  
  Unlocking AI's Potential: Effective Prompting Techniques
Working with Amazon Q CLI is a conversation. The better your questions, the better the answers. I quickly learned that vague prompts like "make a game" were less effective than breaking down the problem into specific, well-defined tasks.Here are a few prompting techniques I discovered.
  
  
  Technique 1: Requesting a Modular Architecture
Instead of asking for a single, monolithic script, I prompted for a clean, organized structure from the start. "Create a project structure for a PyGame-based space shooter. I need separate modules for asset management, sprites (player, enemies, bullets), UI components, and the main game loop. The asset manager should load images and sounds from manifest files." Amazon Q generated a directory structure (, , ) and starter Python files for each module (, , , ). The generated  included a function to read a JSON manifest, which was a huge head start.
  
  
  Technique 2: Defining Behavior with Roles and Rules
When creating enemies, I defined their characteristics and constraints clearly. "Generate a Python class  that inherits from . It needs attributes for health, speed, and score value. Then, create a subclass  that moves in a sine wave pattern down the screen and fires a bullet every 2 seconds." Q provided a base  class and a well-defined  subclass with its  method already implementing the sine wave movement using . This saved me from figuring out the trigonometry and timing loops myself.
  
  
  How AI Handled Classic Programming Challenges
Game development is full of recurring problems. Here's how Amazon Q helped tackle some of the classics: A game needs distinct states like 'main_menu', 'gameplay', 'settings', and 'game_over'. I prompted the AI to implement a simple state machine. It generated a  class that held the current state and handled transitions, ensuring that the main menu logic didn't run during gameplay and vice-versa. A core mechanic of any shooter. I asked Q for an efficient way to check for collisions between player bullets and enemies, and between the player and enemy ships or bullets. It suggested using PyGame's built-in pygame.sprite.groupcollide() function, providing a concise and performant solution that I could drop right into my main game loop. I wanted power-ups to drop randomly from destroyed asteroids. I prompted: "When an asteroid is destroyed, there should be a 15% chance of it dropping a power-up. The power-up type (health, speed, rapid-fire) should be chosen randomly." The AI generated a clean if random.random() < 0.15: check and a  call to select from a list of power-up types.
  
  
  Time-Saving Automation: More Than Just Code
One of the biggest wins was using AI for automation  the code. The project summary mentions developer tools, and Q was instrumental here.
  
  
  The Asset Manifest Generator
My game uses JSON files to manage all assets (images, sounds, maps). Manually keeping these in sync is tedious. "Write a Python script for the  directory that scans the  and  directories and automatically generates a  file with all the file paths."This single prompt created a utility script that saved me countless minutes of error-prone manual editing every time I added a new enemy sprite or sound effect.
  
  
  The Cross-Platform Launcher
I wanted a simple way for anyone to run the game, regardless of their OS. "Create a Python script named  that checks the user's operating system. It should ensure all dependencies from  are installed using pip and then launch the  script."Q generated a script using the  and  modules that provided a one-click experience‚Äîa small but professional touch that I might have skipped otherwise.
  
  
  AI-Generated Code That Impressed Me
It's one thing to generate boilerplate, but another to produce elegant solutions. Here are a couple of snippets that stood out.
  
  
  1. Manifest-Driven Asset Loader
This function, generated early on, set the foundation for the game's modularity. It loads all assets listed in a JSON file into a dictionary, making them easily accessible throughout the game.This design is clean, error-handled, and makes adding 50 new assets as easy as adding one.A Base Class for Animated UI Panels
I wanted the UI to have a modern, "glowing" feel. I asked Q to create a reusable class for this.
# Part of src/ui.py
import pygame

class GlowingPanel(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    """
    A UI panel that has a subtle pulsing glow effect by alpha blending.
    """
    def __init__(self, rect, color, glow_color):
        super().__init__()
        self.rect = rect
        self.color = color
        self.glow_color = glow_color
        self.image = pygame.Surface(self.rect.size, pygame.SRCALPHA)

        self.glow_alpha = 100
        self.glow_direction = 2 # Rate of change for alpha

    def update(self):
        """Update the pulsing glow effect."""
        self.glow_alpha += self.glow_direction
        if self.glow_alpha >= 180 or self.glow_alpha <= 80:
            self.glow_direction *= -1

        self.image.fill((0, 0, 0, 0)) # Clear with transparency

        # Draw base panel
        pygame.draw.rect(self.image, self.color, (0, 0, self.rect.width, self.rect.height), border_radius=8)

        # Draw glow effect (a slightly larger rect with changing alpha)
        glow_surface = pygame.Surface(self.rect.size, pygame.SRCALPHA)
        glow_rect = pygame.Rect(0, 0, self.rect.width, self.rect.height)
        glow_color_with_alpha = (*self.glow_color, self.glow_alpha)
        pygame.draw.rect(glow_surface, glow_color_with_alpha, glow_rect, border_radius=10)

        # Blit the glow onto the main surface
        self.image.blit(glow_surface, (0,0), special_flags=pygame.BLEND_RGBA_ADD)
This self-contained class for a UI element with its own animation logic is a great example of the object-oriented code Q can produce. It's reusable for scoreboards, health bars, or any other panel in the game.Final Thoughts
Using Amazon Q CLI for the "Build Games" challenge was a fantastic experience. It didn't just write code for me; it acted as a partner that handled the tedious, boilerplate, and sometimes complex parts of development, freeing me up to focus on the creative vision for "Space Conquer."If you're a developer who hasn't tried integrating an AI assistant into your workflow, I highly recommend it. Pick a fun project, break it down into small pieces, and start prompting. You'll be surprised at how much you can build.And hey, I might even get a t-shirt out of it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>day 4: Django structure</title><link>https://dev.to/rebecca254/day-4-django-structure-2hgj</link><author>Rebecca-254</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 14:57:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello, today marks my 4th day in my journey of developers. Am quite excited to share what I did today while learning Django structure.
  
  
  step 1; setting up my project.
As part of my tech journey, I decided to build a Django project to practice web development. I named my project njeriproject. Here‚Äôs how I got started:
django-admin startproject njeriproject
cd njeriproject
python -m venv rbenv
rbenv\Scripts\activate
pip install django
in this i created a virtual environment by the name brenv and installed django.
Then I created two apps inside it:
  
  
  Step 2: Understanding the Django Structure
After running the command, my project looked like this:njeri/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manage.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mysite/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ settings.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ urls.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ asgi.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ wsgi.py

I explored and learned what each file does:- This lets me run commands like runserver or makemigrations- This Contains all project settings like installed apps and database config- Handles all routing and linking to app URLs- Help when deploying to a web server
  
  
  Step 3: Creating Two Django Apps
To organize my site into separate features, I created two apps where each app came with important files like;
views.py, models.py, admin.py, apps.py, tests.py, and a migrations/ folder
  
  
  Step 4: Registering the Apps
To make Django recognize both apps, I opened mysite/settings.py and added them in INSTALLED_APPS 
  
  
  Step 5: Writing Views and Creating URLs

In app1/views.py i created this codefrom django.shortcuts import render

def app1_home(request):
    return render(request, 'app1_home.html')

then created urls.py for app1 added the following in itfrom django.urls import path
from .views import app1_home

urlpatterns = [
    path('', app1_home, name='app1_home'),
]
** For app2**
In app2/views.py:from django.shortcuts import render

def app2_home(request):
    return render(request, 'app2_home.html')
Then I created app2/urls.py:from django.urls import path
from .views import app2_home

urlpatterns = [
    path('', app2_home, name='app2_home'),
]

  
  
  Step 6: Connecting Both Apps in mysite/urls.py
Now it was time to connect both apps to the main URL configuration.In mysite/urls.py I wrote:from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('app1/', include('app1.urls')),
    path('app2/', include('app2.urls')),
]

At first, I forgot to import include and Django gave me an error. But once I fixed that, the server ran smoothly.
  
  
  Step 7: Adding Templates for HTML Pages
After getting simple text responses to show up using HttpResponse, I wanted to display proper HTML pages using templates.So I created a templates folder inside each app
In both app1 and app2, I made this folder structure:app1/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app1/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ home.html
app2/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app2/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ home.html
I created basic HTML files in both apps.I updated the views to render templates
In app1/views.py:from django.shortcuts import render

def home(request):
    return render(request, 'app1/home.html')
In app2/views.py:

`from django.shortcuts import render

def home(request):
    return render(request, 'app2/home.html')
I ran the server with the following commandpython manage.py runserverThen I opened my browser and tested. this is what my page looked like after adding /app1 in the URL generated. Seeing both apps work made me feel proud and confident in using Django.Django projects can be modular ‚Äî I can add many apps like I did with app1 and app2.The outer folder (njeri) holds everything; the inner mysite/ config folder manages settings, URLs, and deployment files.Even small mistakes (like forgetting include) can break the app ‚Äî but the error messages help a lot
Building the njeri project taught me how Django is structured and how everything connects from creating apps, to writing views, to linking URLs. Working with two apps in one project showed me Django‚Äôs power and flexibility.I‚Äôm still learning, but now I feel more confident to build real Django websites.

Test your knowledge with our interactive ‚ÄúUse TorchAudio to Prepare Audio Data for Deep Learning‚Äù quiz. You‚Äôll receive a score upon completion to help you track your learning progress:Learn Essential Technical TermsBefore diving into the technical details of audio processing with TorchAudio, take a moment to review some key terms. They‚Äôll help you grasp the basics of working with audio data.A waveform is the visual representation of sound as it travels through air over time. When you speak, sing, or play music, you create vibrations that move through the air as waves. These waves can be captured and displayed as a graph showing how the sound‚Äôs pressure changes over time. Here‚Äôs an example:A Sample Waveform of a 440 Hz Wave

This is a waveform of a 440 Hz wave, plotted over a short duration of 10 milliseconds (ms). This is called a time-domain representation, showing how the wave‚Äôs amplitude changes over time. This waveform shows the raw signal as it appears in an audio editor. The ups and downs reflect changes in loudness. is the strength or intensity of a sound wave‚Äîin other words, how loud the sound is to the listener. In the previous image, it‚Äôs represented by the height of the wave from its center line.A higher amplitude means a louder sound, while a lower amplitude means a quieter sound. When you adjust the volume on your device, you‚Äôre actually changing the amplitude of the audio signal. In digital audio, amplitude is typically measured in decibels (dB) or as a normalized value between -1 and 1. is how many times a sound wave repeats itself in one second, measured in hertz (Hz). For example, a low bass note is a sound wave that repeats slowly, about 50‚Äì100 Hz. In contrast, a high-pitched whistle has a wave that repeats much faster, around 2000‚Äì3000 Hz.In music, different frequencies create different musical notes. For instance, the A note that musicians use to tune their instruments is exactly 440 Hz. Now, if you were to look at the frequency plot of the 440 Hz waveform from before, here‚Äôs what you‚Äôd see:A Frequency Domain Plot of a 440 Hz Wave

This plot displays the signal in the , which shows how much of each frequency is present in the sound. The distinct peak at 440 Hz indicates that this is the dominant frequency in the signal, which is exactly what you‚Äôd expect from a pure tone. While time-domain plots‚Äîlike the one you saw earlier‚Äîreveal how the sound‚Äôs amplitude changes over time, frequency-domain plots help you understand which frequencies make up the sound.The waveform you just explored was from a 440 Hz wave. You‚Äôll soon see that many examples in audio processing also deal with this mysterious frequency. So, what makes it so special? The 440 Hz frequency (A note) is the international standard pitch reference for tuning instruments. Its clear, single-frequency nature makes it great for audio tasks. These include sampling, frequency analysis, and waveform representation.Now that you understand frequency and how it relates to sound waves, you might be wondering how computers actually capture and store these waves. When you record sound digitally, you‚Äôre taking snapshots of the audio wave many times per second. Each snapshot measures the wave‚Äôs amplitude at that instant. This is called sampling. The number of snapshots taken per second is the , measured in hertz (Hz).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I Built a Tool to Search AI Conversations in 1 Week (With Heavy AI Assistance)</title><link>https://dev.to/d_p_6e7c8572c8febaab6c33d/i-built-a-tool-to-search-ai-conversations-in-1-week-with-heavy-ai-assistance-2elj</link><author>D P</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 13:50:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I had hundreds of AI conversations with Claude and ChatGPT. Valuable code, solutions, and insights were buried in those exports. Sure, I could grep through them with my hacky script (claude_ai_convo_dump_extractor - great name, right?), but I wanted something better.So last week, with AI enthusiastically egging me on that this would be a "great resume project," I built ChatMine.
  
  
  The Twist: AI Built It Too
Here's where it gets meta. I used Claude Code extensively to build ChatMine. Yes, AI helped me build a tool to search AI conversations. ü§ñIn just one week, I went from idea to working product with:Semantic search using FAISSAutomatic code extractionWeb interface with FastAPIFull CLI with rich output
  
  
  What ChatMine Actually Does
python claude_ai_convo_dump_extractor.py export.json
 ./extracted/
chatmine import-claude claude-export.zip
‚úì Imported 312 conversations
‚úì Extracted 1,847 code snippets

chatmine search 
Found 5 relevant conversations:
1. March 2024
2. February 2024
...

chatmine code-search 
Found 23 Python async functions across your conversations

chatmine export-conversations  ./searchable/
rg  ./searchable/

  
  
  The Good, The Bad, and The Honest
It actually works! Fully functional with extensive testsSolves a real problem (beyond my hacky grep scripts)Modern Python stack: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Click, FAISSYou can STILL grep the exports, but now with better organizationI don't fully understand some ML libraries I used (FAISS, sentence-transformers)Some advanced features were "suggested" by AI that I couldn't build myselfTests were sometimes written after the code (I know, I know...)AI convinced me this was resume-worthy (it worked - I built it! üòÖ)This is what AI-assisted development really looks like in 2025You can ship impressive software fastBut you need to be careful about technical debt
  
  
  From Hacky Scripts to Proper Tool
My original claude_ai_convo_dump_extractor was exactly what it sounds like - a script that dumped conversations so I could grep them. ChatMine evolved from that need but added: - SQLite instead of flat files - Find concepts, not just keywords - Automatically extracts and categorizes code - Organized markdown with metadataBut honestly? Sometimes I still just want to grep things, so ChatMine can export everything to markdown files organized by date and platform. Best of both worlds!
  
  
  Key Learnings from AI-Assisted Development

  
  
  1. AI Accelerates, But Doesn't Replace Understanding

  
  
  2. Tests Are Your Safety Net
With 90% test coverage, I can refactor confidently even when I don't fully understand every library:
  
  
  3. Keep Simple Options Available
I'm open-sourcing ChatMine with a few goals: - I need help understanding the ML libraries better - Better than hacky scripts! - Honest case study in AI-assisted developmentThe repo includes a candid README about what I built with AI help vs. what I understand deeply.This experiment taught me that AI-assisted development is powerful but comes with responsibilities:Be honest about what you don't understandTest everything thoroughly
Document for your future selfKeep simple alternatives (sometimes grep is all you need!)Be ready to learn the underlying conceptsHave you built anything with heavy AI assistance? How do you balance speed with understanding? Do you have hacky scripts that could become "proper" tools? (We all do!)And if you're still grepping through AI conversation exports... well, now there's ChatMine! üéâCurrently exploring new opportunities in Python/DevOps.

That‚Äôs fine‚Äîuntil it isn‚Äôt:Keyword Search Might Return‚Äú10 Best  Tables‚Äù‚ÄúWimbledon Lawn  Highlights‚ÄùArticles, rules and gear for Keyword engines struggle even more with non-text media: images, audio, video, genome sequences, etc. They simply don‚Äôt ‚Äúsee‚Äù pixels or sound waves.Vector (semantic) search fixes this by turning each item‚Äîtext, image, whatever‚Äîinto a high-dimensional vector. Similar meaning -> nearby vectors. Your query is embedded the same way, and the engine brings back the closest neighbours.‚ÄÇVector search ‚ûú find things that feel the same, not just things that spell the same.
You start with a set of text passages (in the drawing they‚Äôre labelled ‚ÄúText / Answers‚Äù).
Each passage is fed through an embedding model (a neural network that maps text to points in a high-dimensional space).
The model outputs a vector for each passage‚Äîthese vectors (sometimes called word or sentence embeddings) capture the meaning of the text as coordinates in that space.Query Vectorization & Retrieval
When a user asks a question, you send the question through the same embedding model and obtain a query vector.
You then compare that query vector to all of your stored document vectors (e.g. with cosine similarity).
The documents whose vectors lie closest to the query vector are the most semantically relevant answers, even if they don‚Äôt share the exact same keywords. by operating in a continuous vector space rather than matching literal words, you can find passages that ‚Äúmean the same thing‚Äù and surface them to your LLM (or directly to the user). This is the core of semantic (vector) search in Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines.Many open-source vector databases exist; we‚Äôll use  because it‚Äôs lightweight, fast, and has a friendly Python client.Installing Qdrant using docker:docker pull qdrant/qdrant

Installing python client libs:
  
  
  Stage 1: Connections and Data Prep
Import the necessary modules to connect to the vector DB , choose the models that would be required based on the need and study the dataset.
  
  
  Stage 2:  Storage and Index Prep
Create a collection (say for a business problem) and add points (data points or documents) into the collection that would be embedded into vectors.Upsert the relevant section of the documents into vector db.
  
  
  Stage 4: Search capability
Provide a search capability to query the documents say based on similarity matches (cosine distance)
  
  
  Stage 5: Query LLM with Vector DB as a RAG

  
  
  Improving with Hybrid Search
No single search technique suits every scenario. Sometimes you need the precision of keywords (exact product codes, player stats, specific names), and other times the flexibility of semantic matching (similar games, related concepts, broader topics). A  strategy blends both:Sparse (keyword) embeddings for exact matches
Dense (semantic) embeddings for meaning-based recall
 (e.g. reciprocal rank fusion) or  (keyword filter ‚Üí semantic re-rank, or vice versa)Looking up a particular player‚Äôs season statistics? A keyword search is ideal.
Hunting for matches that felt like nail-biters? Semantic search surfaces games with similar ‚Äúexcitement vectors.‚Äù
  
  
  Hybrid Embedding & Fusion

It's my first time building a product within a cross-functional team ‚Äî collaborating daily with front end engineers, product designer, and tech leads. This journey has reshaped how I think, not just about code, but about collaboration, clarity, and ownership.ü§ù From Solo Dev to Team Contributor
Before Tunaresq, I often worked solo ‚Äî picking up tickets, building features, and shipping without much interaction. But working in a real team taught me that alignment comes first. Now, before we start building or updating anything, we sync with our team ‚Äî especially the front-end ‚Äî to avoid mismatches and ensure shared understanding.
Writing APIs isn't just about endpoints ‚Äî it‚Äôs about solving product problems. I now ask:Does this API support a real business case?Is the data structure clear, lean, and secure?Are auth, permissions, and edge cases covered?Working with Django and Django REST Framework (DRF), I‚Äôve built APIs for authentication, user profile management, and notification triggers ‚Äî all tailored to front-end expectations and use-case needs.‚úÖ Redefining "Done"
A task isn‚Äôt truly complete until it‚Äôs:Integrated successfully by the front-endVerified against product requirementsOnly then do I mark it "done" in Click-up. This process ensures quality and tight integration across the stack.üí° Design Before You Build
For any task expected to take hours, I now invest 25‚Äì30% of the time in:Understanding the logic and flowDesigning the API schema or modelPlanning for re-usabilityThis upfront thinking avoids rework and results in cleaner code ‚Äî especially when working with repetitive structures like user roles or permission-based filtering.üìñ Code Reading = Code Leveling
After I complete a task, I make it a habit to read other teammates‚Äô code ‚Äî not just to review, but to learn. I study how they:Structure  and Handle validation and exceptionsThis has helped me absorb better patterns and gradually improve my own coding standards.üß† Owning Tasks, Solving Problems
I‚Äôve learned to take full ownership of tasks from start to finish:Debug independently firstWhen stuck, explain what I‚Äôve tried before asking for helpPropose alternatives when I believe something can be improvedFor example, I once saw a way to simplify a notifications endpoint. Instead of just suggesting it, I prototyped the solution and explained its performance benefit ‚Äî it was adopted.
Right now, I‚Äôm actively contributing to Tunaresq‚Äôs back-end ‚Äî building APIs, refining authentication workflows, and aligning closely with the front-end team. Every feature I build is tested in integration, reviewed for clarity, and aligned with product value. I‚Äôm still in the journey ‚Äî improving daily, learning through feedback, and growing into a product-oriented engineer.Collaboration is a skill. Code is better when teams align.Design before you build. Time spent planning avoids hours of debugging.APIs should serve people. Focus on usability, clarity, and purpose.Own your work.

  Augmented Assignment in Production Python: A Deep Dive
In late 2022, a critical bug surfaced in our real-time fraud detection pipeline. The system, built on FastAPI and leveraging Pydantic for data validation, began intermittently flagging legitimate transactions as fraudulent. The root cause? A subtle interaction between Pydantic‚Äôs internal data manipulation and augmented assignment (, , etc.) when updating a shared, mutable state within an async worker pool. Specifically, the in-place modification of a list used for feature engineering was leading to race conditions and data corruption. This incident highlighted a critical gap in our understanding of augmented assignment‚Äôs behavior, particularly within concurrent and type-sensitive environments. This post details the intricacies of augmented assignment in Python, focusing on production considerations, debugging strategies, and best practices to avoid similar pitfalls.
  
  
  What is "augmented assignment" in Python?
Augmented assignment operators (e.g., , , , , , , , , , , , ) are syntactic sugar for combining an arithmetic or bitwise operation with assignment.  Crucially, they are  always equivalent to the explicit operation followed by assignment.  This behavior is defined in PEP 203 and is tied to the , , etc., methods.  If an object defines an in-place operation method (e.g., ), augmented assignment will invoke that method. Otherwise, it falls back to the equivalent .This distinction is vital.  For mutable objects like lists,  modifies the object in-place, avoiding a new allocation. For immutable objects like integers, the fallback behavior is used, creating a new object.  This difference impacts performance and, as we saw in the fraud detection incident, concurrency.  The typing system, as defined in PEP 484, treats augmented assignment as a special case, allowing for more precise type inference and static analysis.FastAPI Request Handling:  In high-throughput APIs, accumulating request metrics (e.g., latency histograms) often uses augmented assignment to update counters in-place, minimizing allocation overhead.
Async Job Queues (Celery/RQ):  Updating task progress or retry counts within a worker process benefits from the in-place modification offered by augmented assignment.Type-Safe Data Models (Pydantic/Dataclasses):  While Pydantic generally discourages direct mutation, internal operations like updating nested dictionaries or lists within a model can inadvertently use augmented assignment, leading to unexpected behavior if not carefully managed. Accumulating statistics or processing large datasets in a CLI tool often utilizes augmented assignment for efficiency.ML Preprocessing (Pandas/NumPy):  In-place operations on NumPy arrays or Pandas DataFrames using augmented assignment are common for performance optimization, but require careful consideration of data sharing and potential side effects.
  
  
  Integration with Python Tooling
Augmented assignment interacts significantly with Python‚Äôs tooling.  Mypy correctly infers types for augmented assignments, providing static type checking.  However, it can sometimes struggle with complex in-place operations on mutable objects, requiring explicit type annotations. Pydantic‚Äôs validation and serialization logic can be affected by augmented assignment if mutable default values are used.  Using immutable defaults (e.g.,  instead of ) is a best practice.  Testing code that uses augmented assignment requires careful consideration of state management.  Fixtures should be used to isolate tests and prevent unintended side effects.  As demonstrated by the fraud detection incident, augmented assignment in concurrent code requires synchronization mechanisms (e.g., ) to prevent race conditions. configuration for mypy:
  
  
  Failure Scenarios & Debugging
The fraud detection incident was a prime example of a race condition. Multiple async workers were simultaneously modifying the same list, leading to inconsistent data.  Debugging involved: Adding detailed logging around the augmented assignment operation to track the state of the list. Analyzing the exception traces to identify the point of failure. Using  to step through the code and inspect the state of the variables. Profiling the code to identify performance bottlenecks and areas where contention was occurring.Another common failure is unexpected behavior when an object doesn't define the  method, leading to a new object being created instead of modifying the original in-place. This can cause subtle bugs if the code relies on the original object being mutated.
  
  
  Performance & Scalability
Augmented assignment can significantly improve performance by avoiding unnecessary object allocations. However, excessive in-place modification can lead to increased memory usage and contention in concurrent environments. Use  to benchmark the performance of augmented assignment versus explicit assignment. Identify performance bottlenecks and areas where in-place modification is causing contention. Minimize the use of shared mutable state to reduce the need for synchronization. Limit the number of concurrent workers to reduce contention.Augmented assignment can introduce security vulnerabilities if used with untrusted data. For example, if a user-supplied value is used in an augmented assignment operation on a sensitive object, it could lead to code injection or privilege escalation.  Always validate and sanitize user input before using it in any operation.  Be particularly cautious when deserializing data from untrusted sources.  Write unit tests to verify the correctness of augmented assignment operations.  Test the interaction of augmented assignment with other components of the system.Property-Based Tests (Hypothesis): Use Hypothesis to generate random inputs and verify that the code behaves correctly under a wide range of conditions.  Enforce type safety using mypy. Integrate testing and type validation into the CI/CD pipeline.
  
  
  Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns
 Using mutable default values in function arguments can lead to unexpected behavior with augmented assignment. Assuming augmented assignment always modifies the object in-place. Using augmented assignment in concurrent code without proper synchronization.Overuse of In-Place Modification:  Excessive in-place modification can lead to increased memory usage and contention.  Failing to use type hints can make it difficult to reason about the behavior of augmented assignment.
  
  
  Best Practices & Architecture
  Always use type hints to improve code clarity and prevent errors.  Prefer immutable data structures whenever possible.  Separate data manipulation logic from business logic.  Validate and sanitize all user input.  Design code in a modular way to improve testability and maintainability.  Automate testing, type validation, and deployment.Augmented assignment is a powerful feature of Python, but it requires careful consideration, especially in production environments. Understanding its nuances, potential pitfalls, and interactions with other tools is crucial for building robust, scalable, and maintainable systems.  Refactor legacy code to use immutable data structures where appropriate, measure performance to identify bottlenecks, write comprehensive tests, and enforce type safety to mitigate risks.  Mastering augmented assignment is not just about knowing the syntax; it‚Äôs about understanding the underlying CPython internals and designing systems that leverage its benefits while avoiding its potential drawbacks.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Deploy Your FastAPI App on Vercel: The Complete Guide</title><link>https://dev.to/highflyer910/deploy-your-fastapi-app-on-vercel-the-complete-guide-27c0</link><author>Thea</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 12:09:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[So I was working on this FastAPI project last week and needed to deploy it somewhere. I tried a few different platforms, but Vercel turned out to be simple, much easier than I expected!Your FastAPI app(obviously)That's it. No need for complicated server setup or Docker stuff.First, make sure your FastAPI app is working. Here's my simple example:Pretty straightforward, right?You need a  file so Vercel knows what packages to install:fastapi==0.104.1
uvicorn==0.24.0
Important: Always pin your versions! Trust me, I learned this the hard way when my app broke because of package updates.This part is a bit tricky, but not too bad. Create a  file in your project root:This tells Vercel, "hey, this is a Python app, run it like this".Vercel works with ASGI apps (FastAPI is ASGI), but you need to add this:git init
git add 
git commit 
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
git push  origin main
Go to the Vercel dashboardVercel detects it's Python automaticallyAnd... that's it! No server configuration, no SSL certificates, nothing complicated.If you prefer the command line (like me):
npm  vercel


vercel login


vercel
Three commands and you're done!
  
  
  Auto-deployment with GitHub Actions
Want to deploy automatically when you push code? Here's the workflow file:After deployment, check these URLs:https://your-app.vercel.app/ - Main pagehttps://your-app.vercel.app/api/health - Health checkhttps://your-app.vercel.app/docs - FastAPI docs (this is a cool feature!)
  
  
  Things I learned (the hard way)
Vercel gives you HTTPS automatically - no need to worry about certificatesEnvironment variables are easy to add in the Vercel dashboardEvery push to main branch = new deploymentUse  prefix for your routes. Vercel likes it better, especially when you have frontend + backend togetherDon't worry, it happens to everyone:Check build logs in the Vercel dashboard - they usually show what's wrongLook at your , missing packages cause most problemsVerify your  configurationTest locally first. If it doesn't work on your computer, it won't work on VercelThat's it! Your FastAPI app is now running on Vercel's servers worldwide. No need to manage servers or worry about hosting costs (unless you become popular, but that's a good problem to have üòÑ).
The whole process takes maybe 10-15 minutes once you know what you're doing. Pretty good for getting your API online, I think!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Real Python: Quiz: Use TorchAudio to Prepare Audio Data for Deep Learning</title><link>https://realpython.com/quizzes/python-torchaudio/</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[You‚Äôll revisit fundamental terminology and how to:Install and import TorchAudioLoad audio waveform datasetsWork through these questions to check your knowledge about building audio workflows for machine learning in Python.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Demystifying Django: How I Learned the Project Structure (Through My Own Debugging Lens)</title><link>https://dev.to/zabby/demystifying-django-how-i-learned-the-project-structure-through-my-own-debugging-lens-2929</link><author>Zabby</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 10:48:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
  
  
  üß™ Setting Up My Virtual Playground: Virtual Environments on Kali
Before diving deep into Django, I knew I needed to isolate my Python dependencies. I didn‚Äôt want one project to break another just because they used different versions of a package. So I set up a virtual environment, which felt like creating a clean slate for Django to thrive.Here‚Äôs exactly what I did on Kali Linux: Installed virtualenv (if not already there) using the commandsudo apt install python3-venv
 Created a virtual environment in my project folderThis created a  folder containing an isolated Python environment complete with its own pip, python, and site-packages. Activated the virtual environmentOnce activated, my terminal prompt changed (it showed (venv)), and any packages I installed from that point forward were isolated to the project.
To deactivate it run the command: 
  
  
  To Install Django you run the command:
python -m pip install django             

  
  
  üìÅ Step One: The Curious Case of the Double Folder
django-admin startproject my_project
my_project/
    manage.py
    my_project/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        asgi.py
        wsgi.py
At first glance, the repetition felt like a mistake. But then I realized it‚Äôs deliberate:üß† The Brains of the Operation: and Friends
Inside the inner my_project/ folder, I found:: The holy grail of configuration. Middleware, installed apps, static files you name it.: Like Django‚Äôs GPS. Every route begins here. and : I saw them as protocol translators; one for async, one for traditional web servers.Once I edited  to connect my app and saw my static files load correctly, the structure felt alive‚Äînot abstract anymore.
  
  
  ‚öôÔ∏è : My Swiss Army Knife
I underestimated  at first. It looked like a throwaway script until I used it to:Start the development server.Now, I think of it as Django‚Äôs command-line gateway to everything project-related. Where the Magic (Actually) Happens

I got folders for:: My database design sandbox.: Where I learned request and response cycles the hard way.: One of Django's most underrated features‚Äîcustomizing the admin interface became a fun side mission.Having multiple apps that plug into a single project showed me how Django scales gracefully without becoming a monolith.üé® Templates, Static, and Media: The Visual Layer
It finally clicked that templates aren't just HTML they're Django-aware, with  and  blocks for logic and data. Static files gave me some CSS headaches at first, but once I correctly configured , things smoothed out. And media? It‚Äôs where user uploads go. Simple, but essential for anything dynamic.
Learning Django‚Äôs project structure wasn‚Äôt just about reading docs‚Äîit was about navigating errors, debugging misconfigured paths, and rewriting what I misunderstood the first time. Now, when I open a fresh Django project, it feels less like an unknown directory tree and more like a well-organized toolkit.If you‚Äôre just starting with Django, don‚Äôt just copy and paste.

Spanning from winter into early spring, this cultural celebration transforms the stark desert into a vibrant, buzzing township. And among its most captivating features are the luxurious tents and the surreal night skies. These elements bring together traditional hospitality, natural beauty, and celestial wonder to offer an unforgettable travel adventure.The Magic of the White RannWhat makes this expanse even more magical is how it reflects the changing colours of the sky, especially during sunrise, sunset, and moonlit nights. The Rann Utsav is carefully scheduled to coincide with this seasonal wonder, offering visitors the perfect window to explore the region at its most breathtaking.With the terrain glistening under full moonlight and the festive energy in full swing, this desert carnival is best experienced with some planning.It‚Äôs crucial to stay informed about the rann utsav last date so you can maximise your trip and not miss out on key attractions.The Luxury Tent ExperienceGone are the days when desert travel meant roughing it out. Rann Utsav offers travellers the chance to indulge in well-appointed luxury tents that combine tradition with modern comfort. These tents are set up as part of Tent City Dhordo, an organised village of canvas abodes with proper facilities and beautifully curated interiors.Each tent is thoughtfully designed with local Kutchi artwork, handcrafted d√©cor, and modern amenities including comfortable beds, attached bathrooms, and air-conditioning or heating systems depending on the category.

  An Overview of Python None
When you write Python code, you sometimes want to show that something is empty or missing. You use the word  for that.  is a built-in constant that stands for "no value."In English, you might answer ‚Äúnone‚Äù when someone asks how many apples you have. Python uses the word the same way to show that a value is not there.Python lets you store missing or empty values with .The name  now refers to the object , which means nothing has been stored yet.
  
  
  How does Python use None?
Python returns  when a function does not return anything else. You can also use  to show that a variable is not set yet. This helps keep your program clear and predictable.Python returns  when a function has no return value.The function prints a greeting but does not return a value. So Python returns .
  
  
  Is Python None a value or a type?
In Python,  is both a value and an object. It has its own type called . This type only has one value: .You can check if a value is  using the  keyword. This checks if something is the exact same object as .Python uses the  keyword to check for .Use  to compare, not , to be more exact.
  
  
  Is Python None true or false?
The value  counts as false in a condition. That means if you write , Python will treat it like .This makes it easy to check if something is missing or empty by testing it in a condition.Python treats  as false in a condition.This behavior helps your program skip or exit when a needed value is not present.
  
  
  A Historical Timeline of Python None
Where did Python‚Äôs  come from?Python's  was designed to clearly show the absence of a value. This idea came from earlier languages and logic systems. Over time,  became a stable, simple way to say ‚Äúnothing here.‚Äù
  
  
  People created special constants for "no value"
1960 ‚Äî Logical null in Lisp: Used  to show the end of a list or no result.1970 ‚Äî Null pointers in C: Used  as a placeholder when no memory was assigned.
  
  
  People designed Python's version of null
: Introduced  as a built-in name for "no value.": Began using  more clearly in function returns and empty defaults.
  
  
  People made Python None more consistent
: Locked  as a constant. You can no longer reassign it.: Keeps  stable as the one true null value.
  
  
  Problems & Solutions with Python None
How do you use Python None the right way?You often need a way to say "nothing yet" in your code. Python gives you  to do that. These problems show when and how to use it.
  
  
  Problem: How do you show a value is not set yet in Python?
You are writing a quiz game. The player has not chosen an answer yet. You want to save that in a way the program can check. You try using  or , but those are real values. You need a way to say ‚Äúnothing selected.‚Äù Use  as a placeholder until a real answer is chosen.Python lets you mark unset values with .This keeps your code clean and avoids confusion between ‚Äúno answer‚Äù and ‚Äúwrong answer.‚Äù
  
  
  Problem: How do you return nothing from a function in Python?
You write a function that prints a message but should not return any value. You forget to add a return line. You wonder what the function gives back. Python automatically returns  if no return is written.Python returns  from functions without a return line.This shows that Python gives back  unless told otherwise.
  
  
  Problem: How do you check if a result was found in Python?
You write a function that looks for a user. If the user is not found, you want to say so. You use an empty string or zero, but these might be real usernames or values. Return  when no match is found. Then check using .Python lets you check for missing results using .Using  shows clearly that the user was not found.
  
  
  Problem: How do you skip a value in a list in Python?
You are looping through items. Some items should be skipped or ignored. You try to use  or , but those are valid values. You need a better way. Mark unwanted items as , then skip them with .Python lets you skip missing values marked as .This helps you filter out missing items safely.
  
  
  Problem: How do you properly compare with None in Python?
You want to test if a value is , but you write . This works but is not always safe. Python can compare values in a way that gives false matches. Use  to compare objects directly.Python uses  to compare a value with .This keeps your comparisons clear and correct.

With many different database sources, and formats available storing them, managing them and running SQL queries to use them. All of this is very tedious work, one that requires accuracy and fast results.The perfect solution for this, is the new Knowledge Base :- an an advance system that organizes data with its actual meaning not by just cross matching the frequent words or important keywords. MindsDB's new Knowledge Base organizes data by its actual meaning, not just by the keywords or frequent words matchingIt Supports semantic search with context-aware retrievalHandles various data sources like databases, CSV, text, and many other integrations like Youtube, HackernewsUtilizes embedding models, re-ranking models, and vector stores to create embeddings to provide context data retrieval.Enables intelligent querying and meaningful data discoveryTo make interacting with MindsDB's powerful features even more intuitive and efficient, especially its cutting-edge Knowledge Base and AI Agent functionalities, I developed . Kleos (a greek word which summaries, The enduring transmission of meaningful, wise knowledge ‚Äî curated, remembered, and used across time.) is a Python-based async command-line interface designed to be your trusty companion for using the MindsDB Knowledge Base.Every system has its  ‚Äî its final cause or purpose. This CLI fulfills the purpose of MindsDB's Knowledge Base: to seek, structure, and serve insight through intelligent agents. Kleos aims to streamline the process of building and managing these intelligent systems directly from your terminal.This article will walk you through Kleos CLI, highlighting its key features and demonstrating how it leverages MindsDB KB to help you build powerful AI-driven applications with ease.
  
  
  Core Philosophy: SQL as the Language of AI
One of MindsDB's foundational principles, which Kleos has integrated at root level, is the use of SQL as the primary language for AI development. Instead of requiring developers to learn complex machine learning libraries or manage separate MLOps pipelines for many common tasks, MindsDB allows you to:Connect to diverse data sources: From your existing databases to SaaS applications and file storages. Train models for tasks like classification, regression, time series forecasting, and even interact with large language models (LLMs) for generative tasks. Create semantic search capabilities over your textual data. Combine LLMs with your data and KBs to create intelligent assistants.Query Predictions and Insights: Fetch predictions and insights as if you were querying a regular database table.All of this achieved by using SQL extensions. Kleos CLI acts as a convenient and powerful interface to execute these SQL commands, manage your MindsDB resources, and automate workflows, making the power of in-database AI more accessible than ever. We've built Kleos using Python, Click for robust command-line parsing, and Rich for beautiful, informative terminal output.

Getting started often involves connecting to your data. MindsDB excels at integrating with numerous data sources. Kleos helps you quickly set up common datasources. For instance, the HackerNews datasource, a popular source for real-time discussions and articles, can be configured with a single command:kleos setup hackernews  my_hackernews_data
This simple command tells MindsDB to create a connection named  that can query HackerNews directly. Kleos ensures this process is smooth, even creating the datasource if it doesn't already exist when you try to use it in other commands.
  
  
  2. Knowledge Bases (KBs) - The Heart of Kleos ()
Knowledge Bases are a cornerstone of MindsDB's recent advancements, allowing you to embed and search large volumes of text data semantically. Kleos provides extensive support for managing KBs.a. Creating Knowledge Bases ()You can easily create a new KB, specifying the underlying embedding models (to convert text to vectors) and optional reranking models (to improve search result relevance). Kleos supports models from various providers like Ollama (for local LLMs) and Google Gemini.

kleos kb create gemini_ollama_kb  ollama  nomic-embed-text  gemini  gemini-2.0-flash  YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY Kleos handles the construction of the  SQL, including the JSON parameters for model configurations.b. Ingesting Data ()Once a KB is created, you need to populate it. Kleos simplifies data ingestion, especially from structured sources like the HackerNews tables.
kleos kb ingest my_hn_kb  stories  100  my_hackernews_data
For more control, you can specify which columns map to your KB's content and metadata:kleos kb ingest my_custom_kb  comments
   my_hackernews_data
   200
This command translates to an INSERT INTO ... SELECT ... statement, efficiently loading data into your KB.c. Semantic Search ()The true power of KBs lies in semantic search. Kleos allows you to query your KBs using natural language, with options for metadata filtering:
kleos kb query my_docs_kb 
kleos kb query product_reviews_kb  5
The  accepts a JSON string, enabling powerful, targeted queries by combining vector search with traditional attribute filtering.
  
  
  3. AI Agents - Your Intelligent Assistants (, )
MindsDB allows you to create AI Agents that combine the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the contextual knowledge stored in your KBs and databases. Kleos makes agent creation and interaction straightforward.a. Creating Agents ()Define an agent, link it to one or more KBs, and specify the LLM it should use:
kleos kb create-agent product_support_agent 
   gemini-2.0-flash 
  You can also include regular database tables for additional context and pass other parameters like temperature or API keys.b. Querying Agents ()Once created, interact with your agent using natural language:kleos kb query-agent product_support_agent The agent will leverage its LLM and the content from  to provide an answer.
  
  
  4. AI Models / Generative AI Tables ()
Beyond KBs and Agents, Kleos helps you manage MindsDB's powerful AI Models (often referred to as Generative AI Tables). These models are trained on your data using SQL and can perform a variety of tasks.a. Creating AI Models from Data ()Train a model directly from a SQL query. For example, to create a model that summarizes HackerNews story titles:kleos ai create-model title_summarizer
   title_summary
   google
   api_key YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY
   model_name gemini-2.0-flash
This creates a queryable  model. You can then select from it, providing new titles to get summaries. Kleos supports listing, describing, refreshing, and dropping these models too.
  
  
  5. Automation with MindsDB Jobs ()
Repetitive tasks like data ingestion or model retraining can be automated using MindsDB Jobs. Kleos provides commands to manage these jobs.a. Creating Jobs (, kleos job update-hn-refresh)For instance, to create a job that updates your HackerNews data daily:kleos job update-hn-refresh daily_hn_data_update Or, create a custom job with any SQL statements:kleos job create nightly_kb_update
  Kleos also allows you to list, check the status/history of, and drop jobs, giving you full control over your automated workflows. This combination aims to make the Kleos not just powerful but also pleasant to use.
  
  
  Why This Matters: The Power of In-Database AI & Kleos's Role
The ability to perform complex AI/ML tasks directly within your database using SQL, as enabled by MindsDB, is a game-changer. It democratizes AI by lowering the barrier to entry and streamlines workflows by keeping data and intelligence in one place.Kleos CLI aims to be a key enabler in this ecosystem by providing: A user-friendly command-line tool that makes MindsDB's advanced features easy to discover and use. Simplifying common tasks like KB management, agent creation, and job automation.

This isn't science fiction; it's the reality of computer vision (CV), a rapidly evolving field with the potential to revolutionize numerous industries. From self-driving cars to medical diagnosis, computer vision is already transforming how we interact with technology and the world. But what exactly is it, and how does it work?Understanding the Fundamentals: Teaching Computers to SeeAt its core, computer vision is about enabling computers to "understand" digital images and videos. Think of it as giving computers the gift of sight. Unlike humans who effortlessly interpret visual information, computers require sophisticated algorithms and techniques to achieve this. The process generally involves several key steps: This is the initial stage where the computer receives the visual data ‚Äì whether from a camera, a scanner, or a digital image file.  Raw images often contain noise or inconsistencies.  Pre-processing steps, like noise reduction and image sharpening, clean up the data to make it easier for the computer to analyze.  Think of it as preparing a messy kitchen before you start cooking ‚Äì you need a clean workspace to work efficiently.  This is where the magic happens.  Algorithms identify key features within the image, such as edges, corners, textures, and colors.  These features are then represented mathematically, allowing the computer to understand the image's content in a quantifiable way.  Imagine describing a face: you'd focus on the eyes, nose, and mouth ‚Äì these are the features a computer extracts.Object Recognition and Classification:  Using the extracted features, the computer attempts to identify and classify objects within the image. This involves comparing the extracted features to known patterns stored in a database.  This is like recognizing a friend's face based on their features.  This advanced stage goes beyond object recognition, aiming to understand the relationships between objects and the overall context of the image or video.  For example, understanding that a cat is sitting  a mat, not  it.The Significance and Opportunities:Computer vision addresses a fundamental limitation of computers: their inability to directly interact with the physical world through visual input. By bridging this gap, CV opens up a wealth of opportunities:  CV powers robotic systems in factories, warehouses, and even surgery, improving efficiency and precision.  Facial recognition, object detection, and anomaly detection systems enhance security in various settings, from airports to homes.  CV assists in medical image analysis, enabling faster and more accurate diagnoses of diseases like cancer.  Self-driving cars rely heavily on CV to navigate roads, identify pedestrians and obstacles, and make driving decisions.  CV enhances customer experience through features like virtual try-ons, automated checkout, and inventory management.Applications Across Industries:The applications of computer vision are incredibly diverse and continue to expand. Here are a few examples:  Monitoring crop health, identifying pests and diseases, optimizing irrigation.  Quality control, defect detection, robotic assembly.  Tracking player movements, analyzing game strategies, enhancing broadcasting.Environmental Monitoring:  Analyzing satellite imagery for deforestation, pollution detection, and wildlife tracking.Challenges, Limitations, and Ethical Considerations:Despite its remarkable progress, computer vision faces challenges:  Training accurate CV models requires vast amounts of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to acquire.  Processing high-resolution images and videos requires significant computing power, making some applications resource-intensive.Robustness and Generalization:  CV systems can struggle with variations in lighting, viewpoints, and occlusions, limiting their ability to generalize to unseen scenarios.  Bias in training data can lead to discriminatory outcomes, particularly in applications like facial recognition.  Privacy concerns related to image and video data also need careful consideration.The Future of Computer Vision:Computer vision is rapidly evolving, driven by advancements in deep learning, improved algorithms, and increased computing power. We can expect to see even more sophisticated and pervasive applications in the near future. The development of more robust, explainable, and ethically sound CV systems will be crucial to realizing its full potential and ensuring its responsible deployment across various sectors. The ability of computers to "see" and understand the world around them is no longer a futuristic fantasy; it is a powerful technology shaping our present and future, demanding careful consideration of its immense capabilities and potential impact.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Digital Transformation in Agri-Machinery: Autosteer Leads the Way</title><link>https://dev.to/gnss/digital-transformation-in-agri-machinery-autosteer-leads-the-way-4j01</link><author>zly</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 02:04:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the fast-evolving world of agriculture, precision and efficiency have become key drivers for success.

The most basic example to demonstrate this concept is iterating the elements in a list.This is a loop style more suitable when you know the number of times a task is to be repeated. In the following case I know it will be the same number as the quantity of elements in the list. This subtle detail will become more relevant ahead in this chapter.The syntax is very straightforward, but it is important to understand what is actually going on.For each element in , I am declaring a variable , then  it. There's no problem in using the same variable name for all the elements, because for each element there's a new task repetition cycle (iteration), so this variable is re-declared for each element, in every new iteration.In case you are wondering why I named a variable , it's a common practice to use single letters in this very specific context (iterating a collection of elements). But this is a matter of taste, as many people tend to adopt something more descriptive, such as the singular version of the list name. In this case, it would be "branch". Personally, I dislike this approach, since normally these two variables' names become very similar, so it gets easy to mistake them. Learn more about these naming practices in the  post.
  
  
  Iterating over indexes in a collection
As seen in the previous example with branches, each iteration returns the value of the element. But it's also possible to obtain the indexes along with the values, by using the  built-in class :If the syntax of for i, v in enumerate(winners) looks unfamiliar to you, this is a concept explained in the  post. You can also use  with tuples, sets and dicts.Even though I know the number of times this task is to be repeated (a typical use case for the  loop), let's rewrite the example above using the  loop style, so it's easier to visualize what it does.As you can see, it became a lot more verbose than the  example. I initiated  as 0, and while the value of counter is less than the quantity of elements in  (which is 4), the program performs the following tasks: the index  (0 at this moment) in .Increments the value of  by 1 (0 + 1 = 1).Then it moves up to the next iteration, maintaining the new updated value of  (which just became 1), and repeats both tasks again. In other words,  starts at 0, then it becomes 1, then 2, then 3...then it stops, because 3 is less than 4 (remember that  is 4). This signals that the loop is over.Another way of interpreting the  loop is like saying: "for as long as this condition is met ( being less than the quantity of elements in branches), perform the following tasks."Instead of , you may write it . It's a shortcut for the same thing and it's more commonly used. See more about this syntax in the  post.Let's see a more suitable use case for the  loop, which is when you don't know how many times a task will be repeated:Let's analyze the implementation:
The  keyword needs to evaluate a boolean condition. Here,  is a way of saying that the condition for the loop is already met, so the Ô¨Årst loop iteration can take place.Now let's see what happens inside the loop (tasks to be performed):employee_name = input("Employee name: ")
The  function does something very interesting and useful: it asks (prompts) the program user (you) to interact with it by writing a text. This text will become the value of .if employee_name == "michael"
Here you can see a new keyword: . It signals that the loop must be exited immediately if this condition is met. This is a very important detail, because it means that whatever you happen to write after this keyword will be ignored by the loop!With that concept in mind, the task is to check whether  is equal to "michael". If so, then the loop is over. Otherwise, it moves up to the next iteration.print("Hello, world's best boss!")
This is another important concept to grasp. I don't know how many iterations will be required before you (the user) decide to type "michael"...you might feel like writing all the other employees‚Äô names as far as I know. So, in theory, this loop could run forever! That's the point of using the  keyword, so the loop can be exited after the condition ( being equals to "michael") is met.With that in mind, it's only after the loop is over that this Ô¨Ånal  will get executed. Remember: the program is stuck in an inÔ¨Ånite loop, so nothing else happens for as long as the condition is not met!You may use while with other types too, as long as they are validated as boolean. Let‚Äôs change the previous function to implement a number of attempts, instead of having an infinite loop:In this case, the while loop requires that . The  variable starts at 1, which gives a green light to the  loop. Then  is incremented by 1 at each iteration. But if employee_name == ‚Äúmichael‚Äù, the loop is exited via the  keyword. If  reaches 3, it means the user did not type ‚Äúmichael‚Äù after 3 attempts, then the loop is exited too. Notice I added a nice message so the user can see the remaining attempts they have.Alongside  ,  is another keyword used to cause interruptions in a loop. But in this case, to skip only the current iteration. Let‚Äôs see how it works:In this program, each name in the list is expected to be printed, except if it starts with the letter ‚Äúj‚Äù. In this case, the name will be skipped, and the iteration will move up to the next name.In a way, both  and  are similar in their nature. While  exits the whole loop,  exits only the current element in the loop. Also, both can be used in  and  loops.üòä Enjoying this series? The full book contains even more content!

What a fallacy!I used to think the same until my colleague Manuel asked me to review his Pull Request () for a project we were working on. As I reviewed his code, I realized that his code is so much cleaner than mine.What made his code cleaner? Uff, I wouldn't be able to tell, but it felt better. It is like reading your own university essay and then reading one by Paul Graham or Malcom Gladwell - you just know there's a difference.At first, I thought it was just my lack of experience with JavaScript/TypeScript (as a data scientist I mostly wrote Python before). But in reality, it was just me not paying enough attention to and not recognizing all patterns of clean code.Manuel recommended me a book by Robert C. Martin and I bought it immediately. The book is called The Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship. It's an extensive and detailed book that you should not read as a novel from start to finish within a day or two. Instead, it serves as a handbook - read a chapter, reflect on it, and ideally apply it in your work. While the code examples are in Java, most of the lessons are universal to other languages.In this blog post I won't be summarizing or paraphrasing the entire book. First, honestly I don't think I internalized the entire wisdom written there to be able to share it effectively. Second, I encourage everyone to read the book and draw their own conclusions from original source. This advice applies to any topic - always go to the original source. Finally, the book has so many valuable insights that a single blog post can't capture them all.Instead, in this blog, I'll share the first key takeaway I gained after reading and applying some of its principles.write code like you're writing an essay, not just a scriptLet me give one example of code and how to rewrite it if you think about the code as an essay. Suppose that we have a pipeline or a workflow that executes a set of checks. First it runs . If this external check returns , then it proceeds with the second step where the status is determined based on metrics.Here is some dummy implementation of this workflow:
  
  
  improvement #1:  write from top to bottom
The main method in this class is  which is how this workflow will be used in other codebase. Imagine you see somewhere in the codebase  and you want to know what it does. You scroll down to the middle of the file to find  implementation. It references three other methods: ,  and .  So,  you scroll up a bit to check implementation of the first two methods. Where is ? Ahh you scroll down again, this time to the bottom of the file, to find its implementation.Quite a lot of scrolling to follow the code. Imagine reading an essay where the introduction is halfway down the page, the main arguments are at start, and the resolution is in the bottom. We can structure our code better than that. How about reorganizing the code so that as you follow it, you only need to scroll down? This way, everything flows naturally, just like reading a well-structured document.
  
  
  improvement #2: group into chapters
The code inside  handles several tasks at varying levels of abstraction: it calls an external check, fetches metrics, and derives the status from both. However, at its core, it‚Äôs a two-step process. First, it performs an  (), and only if the first step is  does it proceed with the rest of the code (). If this were a book, these would be two distinct chapters: one for each step.So, let's break  into two separate methods:  and . This division allows us to enhance each step with more complex logic without altering the original  implementation.
  
  
  improvement #3:  have intentional naming
Now let's take a closer look at the other methods:  and . The  method's name suggests it returns a , which is clear and straightforward. However, we notice that  takes in two unrelated arguments:  and . To understand what this method does, how it uses each argument, and what arguments it actually accepts, you'll need to dive into its implementation‚Äîespecially if you plan to use it elsewhere.To make the code more intuitive, let's improve the naming and split it into two methods: get_status_from_outcome() and get_status_from_metrics(). This not only simplifies the functions and ensures each does only one thing, but also makes it clear what each method accepts and returns, just from their names:: accepts outcome and returns status: accepts metrics and returns statusOtherwise, instead of creating , we could also consider  which would allow us to pass the entire  variable directly, rather than just check['outcome']. Now let's take a closer look at .This method uses . From the name, you'd expect it to simply fetch metrics from somewhere. When the current status isn't , the method is used exactly that way: it fetches metrics, stores them in a  variable, and then the  is determined from these .However, when the status is , the function is called without saving its output. This suggests that  is doing something more than just fetching metrics, contrary to what the name implies.To address this confusion, we need to dive into the implementation of . Upon inspection, we find that it actually performs two tasks:It triggers a data pre-processing job if it hasn't been triggered already.It fetches the pre-processed data and converts it into metrics.The solution is to refactor fetch_metrics so that the data pre-processing logic is separated into its own function, e.g. trigger_data_preprocessing(). This will make the code more understandable and prevent any misconceptions about what  is doing.Ultimately, the names of functions and variables should reflect their purpose and intention clearly. By choosing meaningful names, you're essentially translating your plan‚Äî"first, I will trigger data processing, then I will fetch metrics, and finally, I will derive the status from these metrics"‚Äîinto the code itself. The specific details, such as how processing or fetching is implemented, become secondary and abstracted away. To conclude, the core plan remains clear and easy to follow, ensuring that anyone reading the code understands the overall structure and flow at a glance, much like skimming a book by chapters and then diving into each chapter by sections.Does it look better? What else can be improved?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I created a script that generates word lists based on various input combinations.</title><link>https://dev.to/0xanubiis/i-created-a-script-that-generates-word-lists-based-on-various-input-combinations-4dbj</link><author>Aser Ahmed</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 16:58:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The script idea is simple: you provide some words to the tool, and it will generate a word list with combinations of the words along with other elements like numbers or symbols.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Data Science Projects You can start this weekend</title><link>https://dev.to/pawandeore/data-science-projects-you-can-start-this-weekend-14dl</link><author>pawan deore</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 15:32:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Looking for some hands-on data science projects to sharpen your skills this weekend?

I am a 20 year old, my generation's attention span is messed up and we cannot focus if the video is longer than 5 minutes because of all the brainrot that we watch on Instagram or Youtube or other platforms. 
This is the reason why, Using Murf AI, I have created a system where even if the video is long, the consumer does not get bored.
Simply, the idea is to input a video, an interesting commentary is generated, consisting of a funny voice and an informative voice having a conversation about the video, that the end-consumer can listen to and get a proper idea of what is going on in the video.Github Repository Link to the ProjectHow I have used MURF in the project
I have used murf to procedurally generate the commentary for the videos that are inputted by the user :). For now, this has been done procedurally but once i get the credits (If i win :) or i get a paid subscription), I can use the 'context' feature provided by MURF AI to generate the voices in just a single concurrent thread. I have used the Ken Voice with High pitch and speed at the "clown" setting, so that it sounds funny. For the informative voice, I have used the Abhik voice in a "conversational" tone with a +10% speed so people like me won't get bored when getting lectured. 
This can be heavily used in Social Media Marketing by companies that are making content that is heavily targeted towards the younger generations such as Gen Z or Gen Alpha. Due to the reducing attention span in these generations, It is possible to promote content in a quirky but informative way by using MURF AI voices to put the videos in a conversational context and help the user get a better gist of the product before getting into the actual proper video. Also a lot of game shows can use these conversational channels to make user-engagement a lot better and increase the popularity ratings of their shows by making the end-consumer more involved in the process itself.Created with Love by Me :) Sanat Kulkarni]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Getting Started with gRPC in Python (With a Restaurant Twist üçï)</title><link>https://dev.to/c_6b7a8e65d067ddc62/getting-started-with-grpc-in-python-with-a-restaurant-twist--3688</link><author>cycy</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 15:01:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you've ever wondered how different parts of an app talk to each other ‚Äî or how microservices "call" each other behind the scenes ‚Äî this one's for you.In this post, I'll show you how to use  to build a menu service. We'll keep things light, use a kitchen/waiter analogy üçΩÔ∏è, and write some real working code together.
  
  
  üîÑ What's gRPC? (But Make It Restaurant-Themed)
Let's say you're at a restaurant: = the  (makes food) = the  (asks for food) = the  (what's available)The waiter goes, "Hey, what's on the menu today?"
The kitchen replies with delicious dishes.This is literally what gRPC helps services do: ask for stuff, get a response ‚Äî but way faster and stricter than REST.First, let's install what we need:pip grpcio grpcio-tools

  
  
  üìù Step 1: Define the Language ()
We need a shared language both waiter and kitchen understand.Create a file called :
  
  
  ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Generate Python Code from the Proto
This turns your  file into real Python code.python  grpc_tools.protoc  menu.proto
Boom üí• ‚Äî now you've got  and .
  
  
  üßë‚Äçüç≥ Step 3: Build the Server (Our Kitchen)

  
  
  üßæ Step 4: Create the Client (Our Waiter)
 (in one terminal):
 (in another terminal):
You should see something like:üìã Today's Menu:
----------------------------------------
üçΩÔ∏è  Pizza Margherita
    Fresh tomatoes, mozzarella, basil
    üí∞ $12.99

üçΩÔ∏è  Classic Burger
    Beef patty, lettuce, tomato, cheese
    üí∞ $9.99

üçΩÔ∏è  Caesar Salad
    Crispy romaine, parmesan, croutons
    üí∞ $8.50

  
  
  üß† What's Actually Happening?
+-----------+        ask for menu       +-----------+
|  Client   |  ---------------------->  |  Server   |
| (Waiter)  |                          | (Kitchen) |
|           |  <----------------------  |           |
|           |      send back menu      |           |
+-----------+                          +-----------+

The waiter (client) asks for the menu using a specific method call. The kitchen (server) replies with a structured list of menu items. No JSON parsing, no HTTP overhead ‚Äî just pure, efficient communication.
  
  
  ü§î Why Use gRPC Instead of REST?
Protocol Buffers (binary)
  
  
  üöÄ Level Up: Add Error Handling
Want to make it production-ready? Here's how to add proper error handling to your server:your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ menu.proto
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ menu_pb2.py (generated)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ menu_pb2_grpc.py (generated)
Always use with grpc.insecure_channel() for proper connection cleanupAdd proper logging with Python's  moduleUse virtual environments: For production, use secure channels with TLSNow that you've got the basics down, here are some fun directions to explore: (Create, Update, Delete menu items)Connect to a real database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) with JWT tokens for real-time updates for easy distributionLet me know in the comments if you want tutorials on:üîí  with authenticationüêò  integration
üåä  (real-time data)üê≥ Dockerizing gRPC servicesüîÑ  (best of both worlds)Drop them below ‚Äî I love helping fellow devs learn backend stuff!

  Update: User authentication Part 2
In user authentication part 1, I mentioned about starting with Token based authentication and securing product model. I have further extended this authentication feature with these added functionality:Both Product and Category models are protected: Only authenticated user can create POST/PUT/DELETE request. Anonymous user can only view the product and category, they cannot make any modification.Built user profile: This route allowed user to view their profile and update their profile details.Added change password functionality: Logged in user can change their password and on successful change of password their old token gets deleted and a new token is generated.Added logout functionality: Logged in user can now logout, that means their token will be deleted. So the token they received on login is no longer valid.Testing: Tested deleting or updating product or category only when logged in.

  üå∏ Week 2 of My Python Summer ‚Äî Diving Deeper Into the Magic of Code
After a gentle yet curious start in Week 1, I stepped into Week 2 of my Python journey with a heart full of questions and fingers ready to explore. And what a week it has been! üöÄüêç
  
  
  üß† Learning That Felt Like Unlocking Doors
This week, I dove deeper into  and  ‚Äî and suddenly, the language began to feel like a friend I was getting to know. Understanding how Python handles different data types like integers, floats, strings, and booleans helped me build a stronger foundation.üßÆ Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators
‚ûï Compound assignment operators
Each one felt like a new tool in my creative coding toolbox üß∞‚ú®### üåü Why Python? I Discovered the ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù
While learning the  and the , I also paused to understand the .
And that‚Äôs when I truly appreciated Python's simplicity and power.  üìñ Readability and elegance
üßµ A rich standard library
üåç Versatility across fields ‚Äî from data science to web development
Python isn‚Äôt just a language ‚Äî it‚Äôs a gateway to endless possibilities.
  
  
  üìù Quizzes, Tests & The Joy of Measuring My Growth
I challenged myself with quizzes and small tests to reflect on how much I really understood ‚Äî and I was surprised by how much I had retained!
These small self-checks gave me both clarity and confidence.
  
  
  üß© Practice Makes Power: 30+ Problems, 15 Assignments!
This week, I stayed consistent and:‚úÖ Solved ‚úÖ Completed 15 assignment-style questions
Each one sharpened my logic and made me fall a little more in love with problem-solving.
  
  
  üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Python‚Äôs Inbuilt Magic ‚ú®
Another gem this week was discovering Python‚Äôs  ‚Äî like , , , , and many more.
They‚Äôre like little spells that make your code compact, powerful, and clean.Next week, I‚Äôm excited to:Dive deeper into  and advanced Practice hands-on questionsExplore  to apply what I‚Äôve learned
I can already feel my mind starting to think in logic blocks and loops. Python is becoming more intuitive with every passing day.
  
  
  üíå A Note to Future Me (and Anyone Reading)
This journey isn‚Äôt about speed ‚Äî it‚Äôs about depth, joy, and staying curious.
Each line of code I write is not just syntax ‚Äî it‚Äôs a small affirmation that I'm learning, growing, and becoming the programmer I dream of being.‚ÄúKeep showing up. Even when the bug bites back.‚ÄùHere‚Äôs to more bugs, more breakthroughs, and more beautiful logic.

It's used to represent decision trees. Consider this diagram example as a decision tree:In programming, "Did Ryan start the Ô¨Åre?" could be represented as a boolean variable. If , then the result could be the string "Sing 'Ryan started the Ô¨Åre' ". But if , then "It was the toaster".Let's hop into some Python examples:In this example we are using the  and  keywords as a decision tree about a discount to be applied. In other words: if  is greater than 10.0, then  is 20.0. Otherwise (that's what  means),  is 10.0. In our case, the condition is  (40.0 > 10.0), so  is 20.0.The remaining part is a pure mathematical operation to get the Ô¨Ånal price with the discount applied.But what if the decision tree requires more than two possibilities? That's where the  keyword comes in:In this example, there are three possibilities that will inÔ¨Çuence both bonus and message variables according to the value of :Possibility ‚ÄúA‚Äù:  , then bonus is 100.0Possibility ‚ÄúB‚Äù: . Here we used the  keyword, which roughly translates into ‚Äúotherwise, if‚Ä¶‚Äù, then bonus is 50.0.Possibility ‚ÄúC‚Äù: if none of these 2 previous possibilities  are met, we use what is stated by the  keyword, that is the equivalent to saying "otherwise‚Ä¶", then there‚Äôs no bonus variable. That's the reason I didn't need to state , for example; because this conclusion is already implicit! In other words, this possibility works as a fallback/default scenario.You may add  multiple times for 4+ possibilities. Although there are better alternatives for that, such as match cases (See  post), dicts, or even ternaries (see next) in some situations.This is not a different conditional type  but rather an alternative way of using a conventional  statement. Its syntax may not seem very clear at Ô¨Årst glance, so let's take a different approach this time. We have a problem to solve, but instead of jumping into the code implementation, we will first gather more details about the problem itself:A triangle may be classified in three types, accordingly to the length of its sides:All sides of equal lengthTwo sides of equal length and one side that is differentAll three sides of different lengthAlso, the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side. If this condition is not met, then it's not a valid triangle... For instance, try to draw a triangle having sides 6 cm, 3 cm and 2 cm. You cannot connect all their ends to form a triangle, right?Now that we have more details about the problem, let's implement its solution as a function that uses a ternary to validate the possibilities and return the correct triangle type:Now let's go over the implementation details:
The Ô¨Årst thing to do is ensure the sides are valid. After all, there's no point in checking the triangle type if their sides cannot form a triangle in the Ô¨Årst place... So we perform this validation Ô¨Årst. If the sides are not valid, we exit the function by returning "invalid".
Here's the fun part. Notice that the validation works as a cascade, where each validation only takes place if the previous one is . It returns the value assigned to : which may be "equilateral", but only if side_1 == side_2 == side_3. If this is , then it is "isosceles", but only  or . If this is also , then it is "scalene", which works here as a fallback/default value.As mentioned earlier, the ternary syntax is a little unfamiliar, so it may take some time to get used to. Practicing is the key!Take a look again at the  function. Notice we didn‚Äôt use an  statement to check that the triangle has 3 valid sides. If you recall from the  post, whenever the  keyword is found in a function, the function is exited ! We could have placed an  right after part 1 (that checks that the sides are valid), but because we added a , there‚Äôs no need for that. Let‚Äôs consider another problem: say that a person is only allowed to drive at 18 years old, so we will write a function to check that. It should receive the person‚Äôs age as a parameter, and return  if they are allowed to drive, or  otherwise. Here‚Äôs three different implementations:
This is what we would call a naive approach. The classic structure of the statements ‚Äútrains‚Äù us to think that we must add this , because there‚Äôs another condition to be verified ( not being >= 18).
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to understand what  does. The function returns  by default, but , it returns .
Here‚Äôs an example of how helpful a boolean can be (see more in the   post). The validation of  is, itself, a boolean. So we simply return it.The main reason why you should avoid using  in functions is clarity. See for yourself. It requires less cognitive effort and time to understand what  does, compared to the other two ones.
  
  
  Dict as an alternative to conditionals
If you have 3+ conditionals, a dict (covered in the  post) can be another interesting alternative to an  conditional:In this example, the keys (department names) in  are roughly the equivalent to  conditionals. If the  parameter is found in , then its respective value (a list with people in the department) gets returned. But if it‚Äôs not found, then an empty list is returned. Wish to add a new ‚Äúcondition‚Äù? Just add a new key: value pair (department name and list of people, respectively) to ! The try and except keywords are covered in the  post. For now, keep in mind that if the  argument is not a key in , then an empty list is returned.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Node.js vs Python: Battle of the Unhinged Scripting Languages That Ruined My Sleep Schedule</title><link>https://dev.to/liemar90/nodejs-vs-python-battle-of-the-unhinged-scripting-languages-that-ruined-my-sleep-schedule-11fj</link><author>Liemar Sarol</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 12:53:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey.

  Beyond Dataclasses: Productionizing Python with In late 2022, a critical bug in our distributed tracing system nearly brought down our core payment processing pipeline. The root cause? A subtle mutation of an immutable data object representing a trace span, leading to inconsistent state across microservices. We were using standard Python dictionaries to represent these spans, relying on developer discipline to avoid modification.   was the immediate solution, providing a robust, type-safe foundation for our tracing data models. This incident highlighted a painful truth: relying on convention for data integrity in a complex, distributed system is a recipe for disaster. This post dives deep into , exploring its architectural implications, performance characteristics, and practical considerations for building production-grade Python applications.
  
  
  What is "attrs" in Python?
 is a Python package that simplifies writing classes, primarily data-holding classes, by automatically generating boilerplate code like , , , and .  It‚Äôs not a replacement for classes, but a powerful tool for  them more concisely and reliably.  Technically,  leverages Python‚Äôs metaclass system to modify class creation. It‚Äôs heavily inspired by similar libraries in other languages (e.g., Lombok in Java) and predates Python 3.7‚Äôs built-in . While  have narrowed the gap,  remains superior in several key areas: more robust type validation, extensive customization options, and a more mature ecosystem.  It‚Äôs fundamentally about declarative data modeling, shifting focus from implementation details to  the data represents.FastAPI Request/Response Models:  We use  extensively in our FastAPI applications to define request and response schemas.  This provides automatic validation via Pydantic integration (see section 4), ensuring data integrity at the API boundary.  The performance overhead is negligible compared to manual validation.  Our asynchronous task queue utilizes  to define job payloads.  The immutability enforced by  prevents accidental modification of job data during processing, crucial for idempotency and reliability.Type-Safe Data Pipelines:  In our data engineering pipelines,  classes represent data records flowing through various transformation stages.  This provides strong typing and facilitates data quality checks at each step.  We use  to define configuration objects for our CLI tools built with Click. This allows for easy validation of command-line arguments and provides a structured way to manage application settings.Machine Learning Preprocessing: classes define the configuration for our ML preprocessing pipelines.  This ensures consistent data transformations across training and inference, reducing the risk of model drift.
  
  
  Integration with Python Tooling
 plays exceptionally well with the modern Python ecosystem. classes are fully compatible with mypy, providing static type checking.  We enforce strict type checking in our CI pipeline. integrates seamlessly with Pydantic for runtime validation and serialization/deserialization.  This is a common pattern in FastAPI and other data-intensive applications. classes are easily testable.  The  method generated by  simplifies assertion comparisons. classes can be used in asynchronous code without issues.  Immutability is particularly beneficial in concurrent environments.Here's a snippet from our :We also use a custom runtime hook to ensure all  classes are validated on startup in critical services:This example demonstrates several key features:  enforces immutability,  requires keyword arguments, and  provides built-in validation.  The  hook allows for custom validation logic.
  
  
  Failure Scenarios & Debugging
A common pitfall is forgetting to mark a class as .  This can lead to unexpected mutations, as demonstrated in our tracing system incident.  Another issue is complex validation logic in  that can mask underlying problems.Debugging  classes is similar to debugging regular classes.  However, the generated methods can make tracebacks less informative.  Using  or a debugger with source code mapping is crucial.  Runtime assertions can also help catch unexpected state changes.Here's an example of a bad state we encountered:The fix is simple:  and using immutable data structures for fields like  (e.g., ).
  
  
  Performance & Scalability
 introduces a small performance overhead compared to manually written classes. However, this overhead is usually negligible in most applications.  We‚Äôve benchmarked  classes against equivalent  and found the performance difference to be within acceptable limits.  Minimize the use of global variables and shared mutable state.  Reuse objects whenever possible.  Use appropriate locking mechanisms to prevent race conditions.  For performance-critical sections, consider using C extensions to implement custom logic.We use  to identify performance bottlenecks and  to track memory usage. itself doesn't introduce significant security vulnerabilities. However, improper use can lead to security issues.  Insecure deserialization is a major concern.  If you're deserializing  classes from untrusted sources, use Pydantic with strict type validation to prevent code injection or privilege escalation.  Always validate input data thoroughly.We employ a multi-layered testing strategy:  Test individual  classes and their methods.  Test the interaction between  classes and other components.Property-based tests (Hypothesis):  Generate random inputs to test the robustness of  classes.  Enforce static type checking.Our CI pipeline includes:  Runs unit and integration tests.  Performs static type checking.  Tests the code in different Python environments.  Automates the CI process.  Runs linters and formatters before committing code.
  
  
  Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns
 Leads to mutable data and potential inconsistencies.  Can hide underlying problems and make debugging difficult.  Defeats the purpose of using  for type safety.Using mutable default values:  Can lead to unexpected behavior.Not validating input data:  Creates security vulnerabilities.Complex inheritance hierarchies:  Can make the code harder to understand and maintain.
  
  
  Best Practices & Architecture
  Always use type hints and enforce static type checking.  Keep  classes focused on data representation.  Validate input data and handle potential errors gracefully.  Break down complex systems into smaller, independent modules.  Use a layered configuration approach to manage application settings.  Use dependency injection to improve testability and maintainability.  Automate testing, linting, and deployment.  Use Docker or other containerization technologies to ensure reproducible builds.  Document all  classes and their methods. is a powerful tool for building robust, scalable, and maintainable Python applications.  Mastering  requires understanding its architectural implications, performance characteristics, and security considerations.  Refactor legacy code to use , measure performance, write comprehensive tests, and enforce strict type checking.  The investment will pay off in the long run by reducing bugs, improving code quality, and increasing developer productivity.  Don't just use  by default; consider  when you need more control, validation, and a mature ecosystem.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>HardView: The Fastest Way to Get Detailed Hardware Info in Python</title><link>https://dev.to/gafoo/hardview-the-fastest-way-to-get-detailed-hardware-info-in-python-3h0k</link><author>gafoo</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 12:21:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/python">Dev.to Python</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

It's like the outcome of flipping a coin: it must be either head or tails. There's no third option. Despite its simplicity, it's a very useful data type that can help remove ambiguity and provide clarity and elegance to your programs.The two possible values for a boolean are  or .
This is a basic mathematical comparison between numbers using the operators greater than (), less than (), and greater than or equals ().
This can cause confusion sometimes, because the operator for assigning values () is very similar to the operator for equivalence (). Here, the value of this variable is equal to the output of the operation  (which is , since 1 is equal to 1). In this case, adding parentheses may improve readability. Feel free to write it as: . Read more about operators in the  post.
The comparison works for strings and other data types as well. Notice that in  I used the not equal operator . In other words, it's like asking: is "ryan" different than "kelly"? The answer is yes ().
This is a more realistic use case of a boolean. The  function returns the equality check between the  argument and the string "michael". Where it returns  if name is equals to () "michael". Otherwise, it returns . There is not a third possibility!Notice I didn't need to explicitly write  or  as return options.
