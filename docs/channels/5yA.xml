It is a foundational step in any data analysis or science project, traditionally relying on human - driven methods like statistical summaries and visualizations. Today, artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming how we explore data. AI - powered tools can sift through vast datasets faster, find hidden insights, and even allow people to converse with data in natural language. This report introduces the concept of data exploration, discusses traditional approaches, and explains how AI technologies are revolutionizing this practice. Real - world examples – including Powerdrill and modern AI "data assistant" tools – illustrate these changes. Finally, we explore future trends, envisioning an era where AI becomes an indispensable partner in data exploration.
  
  
  Background: What Is Data Exploration?
Data exploration (often called exploratory data analysis, or EDA) is the initial phase of analyzing a dataset. In simple terms, data exploration is the process of examining and analyzing data to understand its underlying structure, patterns, and relationships. During this step, analysts aim to get familiar with the data's contents and quality – identifying features (variables), spotting any obvious trends or outliers, and formulating hypotheses for further analysis. This stage is crucial for informed decision - making because it "unlocks the full potential of data" by revealing what story the data can tell.Before the advent of advanced AI tools, data exploration was largely manual. Analysts would typically begin with summary statistics (like calculating averages, ranges, or counts) to get a sense of each variable's distribution. They would use data visualization extensively – plotting charts such as histograms, scatter plots, and bar graphs – to see patterns and relationships. For example, a scatter plot could show the relationship between two variables (e.g. sales vs. advertising spend), while a histogram reveals the distribution of a single variable. Using these tools, analysts can identify trends (like a positive correlation between advertising and sales), detect anomalies or outliers, and check assumptions (such as whether data follows a normal distribution). In cases of very high - dimensional data (many variables), analysts might use techniques like dimensionality reduction (e.g. principal component analysis) to simplify the data while preserving key patterns. Traditional data exploration is an iterative, time - consuming process: analysts form questions, slice and dice the data in different ways, then refine their questions or clean the data further based on what they discover. It demands technical skills (for writing queries or code) and domain knowledge to interpret the findings properly. In short, before AI, exploring data was like manual detective work – powerful but limited by human effort and perspective.
  
  
  Challenges of Traditional Exploration:
While effective, the manual approach has limitations. It can be slow and labor - intensive, often taking hours or days to scour through large datasets. Non - technical stakeholders (like business managers) typically have to rely on specialists to do the exploration, because using tools like SQL databases, Excel, or coding in Python/R requires expertise. Moreover, human - led exploration can be biased or incomplete – analysts tend to look for answers to questions they suspect are important, which means anything outside those hypotheses might be missed. For instance, a sales analyst might examine how revenue relates to marketing spend and miss that seasonality or external economic factors are actually more significant, simply because they weren't on the initial list of questions. Traditional tools (e.g. fixed business intelligence dashboards) also often show only a limited slice of the data – they answer the "known questions" but may not flag unexpected patterns. As data volumes grew exponentially in the digital age, these traditional methods started to strain: organizations now collect far more data than a person can reasonably explore manually. This sets the stage for AI to step in and augment the process.
  
  
  How AI Is Transforming Data Exploration
Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing data exploration by addressing many of the challenges of traditional methods. AI - driven data exploration (sometimes called augmented analytics) means using technologies like machine learning and natural language processing to automate and enhance how we explore data. Instead of being a wholly manual, reactive exercise, exploration becomes more automated, proactive, and accessible. Here are several key ways AI is changing the game:AI can dramatically accelerate the exploration process. Tasks that might take a human hours of coding or clicking can be completed in seconds. For example, using a modern AI assistant, analysts have reached insights 10 times faster than before. One tech review noted that analyses which "formerly took several hours can be done in minutes" with AI - powered tools. By automating data crunching – from computing statistics to generating plots – AI allows organizations to get answers quickly, a crucial advantage in fast - paced business settings. Instead of waiting days for a report, decision - makers can ask a question and get results almost instantly.
  
  
  Thoroughness and Deeper Pattern Detection
Unlike a human who might overlook unanticipated relationships, AI has the capacity to check many angles of the data without tiring or bias. An AI system can simultaneously examine dozens or even hundreds of variables to find hidden correlations and patterns. It can systematically test combinations that a person might never consider. For instance, AI can uncover a subtle pattern where a certain combination of customer age, product type, and time of purchase leads to higher sales – a pattern an analyst might miss if they only look at each factor in isolation. As one industry source explains, "AI explores all the data, looking at business problems from every angle and telling analysts what matters." In practice, this means important insights (like an odd cluster of transactions indicating fraud, or an under - served customer segment) are less likely to be overlooked. The AI essentially acts as an tireless scout, flagging anything noteworthy in the data. This thoroughness helps companies move beyond surface - level analysis; for example, instead of just seeing that sales dropped last quarter, AI might pinpoint that the drop was mainly among a certain demographic in a specific region, correlated with a competitor's promotion – nuances that enable a more effective response.
  
  
  Natural Language Interaction & Accessibility
One of the most visible changes is that AI allows people to explore data by simply asking questions in plain language, rather than writing code or complex queries. This makes data exploration much more accessible to non - technical users. Gartner analysts have described analytics as moving "from the domain of the few to ubiquity," as AI tools put analysis capabilities into far more hands. In practical terms, a marketing manager or healthcare worker can now interrogate data without a data analyst as a go - between. They might type or speak a question like, "Which products saw an unusual spike in sales last month in the Northeast region, and why?" and the AI can interpret that, run the appropriate analysis, and return an answer. Business leaders are taking note of this empowerment; nearly 80% of senior IT executives believe generative AI will help their organizations make much better use of data. Many modern analytics platforms have introduced conversational interfaces for this purpose. For example, PowerBI, Tableau, and other tools now include AI features where users can type a question and get an immediate visualization or explanation. One AI - driven service, Powerdrill's Advanced Analytics, lets you "tell [the system] what you want in natural language and let it uncover the trends and patterns in your data." In short, AI is democratizing data exploration – you no longer need to know programming or statistics to derive insights, which helps build a more data - driven culture across entire organizations.
  
  
  Automated Visualization and Insight Explanation
AI tools not only analyze the data; they often present findings in user - friendly ways automatically. This includes generating charts, graphs, and even written summaries of the results. In the past, after doing analysis, a human would have to craft visualizations and write a report to communicate insights. AI can now handle a first draft of that. For instance, one platform's AI feature will return a relevant chart along with a brief narrative, such as "Sales increased 20% in Q2 driven by growth in the X category," when a user asks about quarterly sales. This means the user doesn't have to interpret the chart from scratch – the AI highlights the key takeaway in plain English. Similarly, certain AI tools can produce full reports or dashboards automatically: ask a question in a chat, and the tool might generate a multi - page report with graphs and text interpretations, ready to share. This capability not only saves analysts time, but also ensures that insights are communicated clearly. It bridges the gap between data and decision - makers by telling a story that non - technical stakeholders can easily grasp. The overall impact is faster and clearer communication of discoveries.
  
  
  Proactive Guidance and Reduced Bias
Perhaps one of the most transformative aspects is that AI can take a proactive role in exploration. Traditional analysis is reactive – an analyst must decide which question to ask next. AI - driven exploration flips this script by suggesting interesting questions or patterns on its own. In essence, the AI becomes a collaborator that might say, "Here is something unusual you might want to look into," even if no one explicitly asked. For example, an AI might automatically flag that "customer churn is notably high for users under 25 in the last two months" or might suggest "check if there's a correlation between website traffic and customer support calls." This helps analysts and businesses not miss important insights simply because they weren't initially on the radar. It also helps counter human bias – the AI isn't influenced by preconceived notions about which factors "should" matter, so it can surface non - obvious drivers of outcomes. One whitepaper described this as shifting from reactive to proactive exploration, turning the process into a collaborative dialogue between human and AI. The human expert remains in control, but they now have a smart assistant that can illuminate blind spots and broaden the exploratory scope. This synergy often yields deeper insights than either could achieve alone.These changes in methodology bring substantial benefits. Analysts augmented with AI can focus more on interpreting results and making decisions, rather than wrangling data and generating charts. In fact, surveys indicate many organizations still haven't realized the full potential of their data – 60% of data and analytics leaders said their company's data is not being used to its fullest, and 85% admit they are still using traditional tools like static BI dashboards or spreadsheets to explore data. AI - driven exploration directly addresses this gap by enabling more exhaustive analysis and making advanced analytics accessible to a broader audience. By 2025, augmented analytics (analytics enhanced by AI) is expected to become mainstream, with a majority of analytics processes being AI - augmented. Gartner even predicts that 90% of people who currently only consume analytics (e.g. reading reports) will be able to produce their own analysis with the help of AI, effectively turning passive data consumers into active data explorers. In summary, AI is not replacing the need for human insight, but revolutionizing the process – speeding it up, casting a wider net for patterns, and empowering more people to engage with data. This leads to more informed, data - driven decisions across the board.
  
  
  Applications and Real-World Examples
AI-augmented data exploration is not just a theory; it's being applied across industries and in various tools to solve real problems. Here we highlight a few examples and case studies that demonstrate how AI is changing data exploration in practice, from specialized internal systems at tech giants to everyday business use cases.
  
  
  Powerdrill: AI-Driven Interactive Data Exploration
A modern example of how AI revolutionizes data exploration is Powerdrill – an advanced platform that enables users to interact with their datasets using natural language. Unlike traditional business intelligence tools that rely on manual queries and dashboards, Powerdrill makes data analysis conversational, instant, and accessible to everyone, regardless of technical skill.Built for speed and intuitiveness, Powerdrill allows users to upload datasets and ask questions like "What caused the sales drop in Q2?" or "Which regions saw the highest churn last month?" – and the system responds with clear visualizations and AI-generated insights in seconds. This radically reduces the time spent slicing and filtering data manually.Powerdrill also automates key aspects of exploration: it can proactively surface patterns, highlight anomalies, and suggest follow-up questions to guide the analysis journey. Unlike older systems that require analysts to know what to look for in advance, Powerdrill acts as a smart assistant that helps users discover insights they may not have thought to ask.The platform is especially powerful when dealing with complex or high-dimensional data. Instead of being overwhelmed by dozens of columns and metrics, users can simply state what they want to find, and Powerdrill's AI translates those intents into meaningful queries and visual outputs. Its design philosophy echoes the principle that speed, scale, and intelligence should work together – enabling instant, deep exploration without technical friction.By combining fast backend performance with conversational AI, Powerdrill exemplifies the future of exploratory analytics: frictionless, guided, and deeply insightful. It empowers individuals across an organization – from analysts to marketers to executives – to unlock the value of data with unprecedented ease.
  
  
  AI-Powered Business Analytics and BI Tools
Beyond research systems like Powerdrill, AI is being woven into mainstream business analytics platforms and workflows. Many business intelligence (BI) tools now come with AI assistants or features that make data exploration easier for everyone. For instance, Tableau (a popular data visualization tool) introduced an AI assistant that allows users to ask questions in natural language (branded as Tableau GPT and a feature called Tableau Pulse). If a sales manager asks, "How were our sales in each region this quarter compared to last?", the AI can generate an answer with charts and explanatory text. As mentioned earlier, such a feature might respond with an automated chart and a note highlighting a key insight (e.g. pointing out that "Sales increased 20% in Q2 driven by growth in the Northeast region"). Another example is Microsoft's Power BI, which includes a Q&A visual where users type questions and the software uses AI to interpret and display results. There are also startups and new platforms dedicated entirely to AI-driven analytics – Powerdrill (AI), not to be confused with Google's system, is one such modern service. It lets users upload their dataset and then literally chat with an AI about the data, ask for charts, and dig into insights conversationally. This means even a user with no knowledge of databases or programming can explore data by having a back-and-forth dialogue: "Show me a breakdown of customer sign-ups by month," "Now compare it to last year," "Any anomalies in recent months?" – and the AI will generate the appropriate analysis and visualization at each step. These tools often combine the natural language interface with behind-the-scenes machine learning that can do things like trend forecasting or anomaly detection on request. For example, an AI assistant might not only answer your question about current trends but also, if asked, "predict next quarter's numbers," apply a predictive model to forecast future sales. In essence, AI-powered BI tools act like an intelligent data analyst available to every user. This is changing how businesses operate: instead of waiting days for an analytics team to provide answers, employees at all levels can get immediate insights to inform their decisions, whether it's a retailer analyzing inventory turnover or an HR manager exploring employee survey results. The outcomes are faster decision cycles and a more analytics-driven mindset in day-to-day operations.
  
  
  Finance (Fraud Detection and Risk Management)
The financial services sector, dealing with huge volumes of transactions and data, has embraced AI-guided data exploration to tackle challenges like fraud. For example, credit card companies and banks use AI to explore large transaction datasets in order to detect fraudulent patterns that would be hard for humans to spot. By analyzing enormous, complex data lakes, AI algorithms can identify subtle, recurring patterns and group data into communities (clusters) that humans can't easily see due to scale. In a credit card fraud scenario, an AI might segment millions of transactions by various attributes (location, merchant type, time, device used) and uncover that a certain combination – say, late-night purchases in one city with a particular kind of card – correlates with a high fraud rate. These patterns can then be visualized in intuitive ways (such as network graphs linking suspicious transactions) to help analysts and investigators understand them. AI exploration tools also allow financial analysts to pose "what if" queries in plain language without biasing the outcome. For instance, an analyst could simply ask, "What factors are driving card skimming incidents?" and the system might return a ranked list of risk factors (type of merchant, geography, etc.) gleaned from the data. The outputs can be packaged into clear reports with charts and natural-language explanations, telling the story of the fraud risk to decision-makers. This AI-augmented approach means faster detection and response – instead of sifting manually through millions of transactions or relying on pre-defined rules, banks get proactive alerts and insights. Beyond fraud, financial firms use AI data exploration for things like market trend analysis and portfolio risk: an AI might continuously monitor market data and news, and alert analysts, "Metric X is outside its typical range likely due to event Y," enabling real-time risk management.
  
  
  Marketing and Customer Insights
In marketing, AI-driven data exploration helps companies better understand customer behavior and campaign performance. Marketers often have complex datasets (website analytics, ad campaigns, sales figures across channels) that can be daunting to analyze. AI assistants can quickly answer targeted questions. For example, a marketing team could ask, "Which recent ad campaigns launched in the last 90 days have seen an increase in both cost-per-lead and conversion rate?" and get a prompt analysis identifying the specific campaigns matching those criteria. This type of query might require combining data from multiple sources and applying statistical filters – something that could take hours in spreadsheets – but AI can handle it in moments. Similarly, companies use AI to explore customer journey data, asking, "What user activities tend to predict a purchase?" The AI might find that users who perform a combination of actions (like viewing a certain product video and then adding an item to wishlist) have a high likelihood of converting. This guides marketers to target or nurture those users more effectively. Customer segmentation is another area: AI can analyze dozens of customer attributes and automatically group customers into segments with similar behaviors or preferences, revealing niches that marketers didn't even think to look for. These insights feed into personalized marketing strategies, better customer service, and product development. Importantly, because AI can generate easy-to-understand visualizations and summaries, these findings can be readily shared with teams who may not be data experts, like creative marketing staff or salespeople, thus aligning the whole organization with data-backed knowledge.
  
  
  Healthcare and Scientific Research
(For completeness, another domain) AI-augmented exploration is emerging in healthcare and research fields as well. Researchers and clinicians deal with large datasets – from electronic health records to genomic data. AI helps by finding patterns that can lead to new discoveries or better patient care. For example, a medical researcher could use AI tools to explore a dataset of patient records and ask, "What factors most strongly correlate with 5-year survival in this dataset?" The AI might comb through demographics, lab results, treatments, etc., and highlight unexpected factors (perhaps a certain combination of lab markers and lifestyle factors) linked to patient outcomes. This can generate new hypotheses for medical research. Likewise, public health officials might use AI exploration on epidemiological data to quickly spot outbreaks or risk factors for disease spread, going beyond static reports. While this report focuses more on business data, it's worth noting that any field with data can benefit – from manufacturing (e.g. IoT sensor data exploration to predict equipment failures) to education (analyzing student performance data to identify who needs help). The common theme is that AI enables a more comprehensive and user-friendly analysis process, leading to actionable insights in a variety of real-world scenarios.
  
  
  Future Trends in AI-Powered Data Exploration
Looking ahead, the landscape of data exploration is poised to evolve even further as AI becomes more advanced and deeply integrated into analytics workflows. Here are some future trends and directions where AI-driven data exploration is heading:
  
  
  Even Smarter & Specialized AI Models
Future AI exploration tools will leverage more advanced and specialized models to deliver deeper insights. As of now, many tools rely on large general-purpose language models (like GPT-4) combined with basic domain logic. In the coming years, we can expect AI systems that incorporate specialized algorithms – for example, unsupervised machine learning to automatically detect new clusters or patterns in data without any specific prompt. AI "copilots" might learn from user feedback too (using techniques like reinforcement learning), so they get better over time at highlighting relevant insights or tailoring their suggestions to the domain at hand. We may see AI that is more context-aware – perhaps fine-tuned versions for specific industries (finance, healthcare, retail, etc.), which means the AI will understand industry-specific data nuances and provide more meaningful, domain-savvy analyses. Additionally, research into smaller, efficient AI models could allow organizations to run powerful data-AI internally (ensuring privacy and speed). In short, the "brain" behind AI data exploration will keep getting sharper and more customized for the task, which will further improve the quality of insights it can provide.
  
  
  Real-Time Exploration and Streaming Data Copilots
Another trend is extending AI exploration to real-time and streaming data. Today's AI analysis is often on static datasets or periodic batch updates. In the future, AI will increasingly be applied to continuous data streams – constantly monitoring incoming data and providing insights on the fly. Imagine an AI that watches a live dashboard and actively calls out anomalies or changes: "Alert: Website traffic from region X is spiking above normal right now," or "Sensor data indicates machine 4's temperature is trending higher than usual this past hour." This turns data exploration into a real-time conversation, where businesses can catch issues or opportunities as they happen, rather than after the fact. Some financial firms are already exploring this, with AI copilots for live market data that might say, "Have you noticed a correlation between bond yields and tech stocks breaking down in the last 30 minutes?" For industry, a real-time data copilot could monitor manufacturing or IT system metrics and preemptively warn human operators of potential problems. This proactive, continuous exploration could dramatically reduce response times and enable truly agile decision-making.
  
  
  Integration with Decision-Making Systems
The line between analysis and action will likely blur as AI gets embedded not just in analytics but also in operational systems. In the future, an AI exploration tool might not only find an insight but also suggest or initiate an appropriate response (with human oversight). This is sometimes called closed-loop analytics. For example, if an AI detects that a marketing campaign is underperforming, it could automatically propose reallocating budget to a better-performing campaign, or even trigger that change if allowed. Or in e-commerce, if data exploration shows a sudden surge in demand for a product, an AI could interface with inventory systems to reorder stock preemptively. We are starting to see hints of this as current AI analytics tools integrate with communication and workflow apps – tomorrow's versions might directly plug into business applications to create a seamless path from "insight" to "action". Of course, humans would set the rules and approvals for such actions, but this trend could make analytics more actionable and automated.
  
  
  Immersive and Multimodal Data Exploration (AR/VR)
While it may sound futuristic, research is pointing toward more multimodal and immersive ways to explore data. Today we mostly interact with data via screens (2D charts) and text or voice queries. In the future, you might be able to literally step into your data. For instance, augmented reality (AR) could enable wearing a headset and seeing a 3D visualization of your dataset projected in the room around you. You might walk through a virtual graph of your supply chain or network, touching data points in the air. AI would accompany you as a guide: you could ask questions verbally as you explore the 3D visualization, and the AI would highlight or reshape the data display in response. While experimental, the pieces of this technology are emerging – AI models that can handle both language and visual data, and AR/VR that can create interactive environments. A whitepaper described the vision of "exploring a dataset within a virtual space, where data visualizations appear as objects you can interact with in real-time", with AI narrating insights. Such interfaces could make complex data (like a large network of connections or geospatial data) far more intuitive to explore. In an AR scenario, an executive could literally see and manipulate data around them during a meeting, asking the AI to filter or drill down, making data exploration a hands-on, immersive experience.
  
  
  Ubiquitous Democratization of Analytics
Perhaps the most certain trend is the continuing democratization of data exploration. AI-driven analytics is expected to become as common and standard a feature in software as spell-check is today. In the near future, having a "data assistant" in every application (from Excel to database interfaces to presentation software) could be normal. This ubiquity means everyone, not just analysts, will routinely engage with data. Gartner's vision of analytics moving to "ubiquity" implies that regardless of role – be it a salesperson, teacher, or doctor – people will be able to directly ask questions of their data and get answers, without needing technical mediation. This will further break down barriers between data specialists and others, fostering a truly data-driven culture at all levels. Of course, as this happens, it will be crucial to invest in data literacy (teaching people how to interpret and question data) and AI governance to ensure the tools are accurate and fair. Tools are already being developed with "trust layers" – features that explain how an AI got a result or that double-check the AI's output – to build confidence in AI-generated insights. By making analytics both ubiquitous and trustworthy, organizations can harness information faster and more fully than ever before.
  
  
  Human–AI Collaboration Best Practices
In the future, we will likely formalize how humans and AI best work together in data exploration. Right now, using an AI assistant for analysis can involve some trial and error (for example, figuring out the right way to phrase a question, or knowing when to double-check an AI's answer). As these tools spread, companies will develop standard practices and training: for instance, guidelines that the AI should always show its work (the calculations or code it used) so the human can verify it. There may be clear divisions of labor, such as the AI does the initial 80% of exploratory analysis, and the human does the final 20% of validation, context integration, and storytelling. Training programs will likely teach analysts how to effectively "team up" with AI – how to ask good questions, how to interpret AI outputs critically, and how to correct or refine the AI's analysis. The end goal is a synergy where the human-plus-AI team consistently outperforms what either could do alone. In this envisioned workflow, AI handles the heavy lifting and routine analysis, while humans bring domain expertise, ethical judgment, and creativity to make final decisions. Such collaboration will help catch errors (AI's and humans') and lead to more robust insights.In summary, the future of data exploration with AI is conversational, automated, and omnipresent. We're moving away from the days of laboriously crafting queries and waiting for static reports. Tomorrow's norm may be as simple as asking, "AI, what does this data mean?" and getting a meaningful, well-explained answer back. We are still at the early stages of this transformation – challenges like ensuring data privacy, managing AI errors, and integrating with legacy systems remain. But the trajectory is clear: AI will be an indispensable partner in analysis, one that tirelessly processes information, surfaces insights, and even drafts interpretations. This frees up human talent to do what it excels at – understanding context, asking the right strategic questions, and making thoughtful decisions. In the future of data exploration, humans and AI will work hand-in-hand, complementing each other's strengths. The promise is a world where anyone can glean insights from data, and organizations can leverage information faster and more fully than ever before.

A DevOps engineer opens ChatGPT, types "write a Kubernetes deployment," gets a basic YAML file, and then spends the next hour manually fixing security issues, adding resource limits, and making it production-ready.Here's the thing: The AI isn't the problem. Your prompt is.After working with AI tools for infrastructure automation for the past two years, I've discovered that the difference between getting generic, unusable output and getting production-ready code comes down to one thing: .Today, I want to share the exact framework that transformed my DevOps workflow and helped me generate infrastructure code that I trust to deploy.
  
  
  The Problem with How We Prompt AI
Most technical professionals treat AI like Google Search. We throw in a few keywords and hope for the best:"Create a Dockerfile for Python"But here's what we're doing: We're asking a highly sophisticated AI assistant to read our minds. And when it inevitably fails to deliver exactly what we need, we blame the AI.The reality? AI isn't mind-reading. It's pattern matching. And the patterns it matches are entirely dependent on the information you provide.
  
  
  Enter the C.R.A.F.T. Framework
After analyzing hundreds of successful AI interactions for DevOps tasks, I developed a simple framework that consistently delivers professional-grade results. I call it :ontext: Provide the background and current situationole: Assign a job title or persona to the AIction: What specific thing do you want the AI to doormat: What should the final output look likeone: What style should the AI use in its responseLet me show you how dramatically this changes your results.
  
  
  The Before and After That Will Blow Your Mind
"Make a Kubernetes deployment for Nginx."
✅ The Good Prompt (Using C.R.A.F.T.):(Role) Act as a certified Kubernetes administrator.

(Context) I have a standard Kubernetes cluster on GKE. I need to deploy 
a simple Nginx web server that will serve as a reverse proxy for a 
Node.js application running on port 8080.

(Action) Generate the YAML for a Kubernetes Deployment and a Service.

(Format) The Deployment should use the official nginx:latest image, 
have 3 replicas, and include readiness and liveness probes. The Service 
should be of type LoadBalancer and expose port 80.

(Tone) Add comments to the YAML explaining what each major section does.
The difference in output quality is .The first prompt gives you a basic deployment that's missing:Any real-world considerationsThe second prompt delivers a complete, production-ready configuration with security best practices, proper resource management, and comprehensive documentation.
  
  
  Why Context Is Your Secret Weapon
The  component is where most people fail, but it's also where you can create the biggest impact. Here's what game-changing context looks like:Instead of: "Create a firewall rule"
Try: "I need to open port 5432 to allow our new analytics service to connect to the production PostgreSQL database. Security is critical."
  
  
  🔧 Specify Your Tech Stack
Cloud Provider: AWS
CI/CD System: GitHub Actions  
IaC Tools: Terraform v1.5
Runtime: Python 3.11, Node.js 18

  
  
  📋 Define Your Constraints
"Must run as non-root user""All S3 buckets need encryption enabled""Memory-efficient for small container instances""Follow PEP 8 style guidelines"If you're working with JSON, YAML, or databases, show the AI exactly what format you're dealing with.Here's something most people don't realize: AI models have been trained on millions of examples of how different professionals write code.When you tell the AI to "Act as a Senior Site Reliability Engineer," you're not just giving it a title—you're activating an entire knowledge pattern of how SREs think about:Compare these two Dockerfile requests: "Create a Dockerfile for a Python app" "Act as a Senior Site Reliability Engineer. Create a Dockerfile for a production Python web application."The second one automatically includes:Non-root user configurationSecurity scanning considerationsProduction-ready configurations
  
  
  Action Words That Actually Work
Stop saying "help me with" or "can you." Start using precise action verbs: (for new code/configs) (for improving existing code) (for troubleshooting) (for understanding) (for performance improvements) (for evaluating options)
  
  
  Format: Get Exactly What You Need
The AI can output in virtually any format, but you have to ask:"Provide as numbered bash commands""Output as Terraform HCL""Format as a Markdown table""Generate both Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml""Include comprehensive comments"Since implementing C.R.A.F.T., I've:✅ Reduced my infrastructure code review cycles by 60%
✅ Generated production-ready Terraform modules in minutes instead of hours
✅ Created comprehensive CI/CD pipelines with proper error handling and security scanning
✅ Built monitoring dashboards that actually caught real issues
✅ Automated backup scripts that handle edge cases I didn't even think ofMore importantly, I  the code that comes out of these prompts enough to deploy it (after proper testing, of course).: Next time you prompt an AI, spend 30 seconds providing proper context. Include your environment, constraints, and the "why" behind your request.: Always tell the AI what kind of professional perspective you want. "Act as a DevOps engineer" vs "Act as a security specialist" will give you dramatically different outputs.: Replace vague requests with precise actions and format requirements.: Don't settle for the first output. Ask follow-up questions, request modifications, and refine until it's exactly what you need.
  
  
  The Future Is Conversational Infrastructure
We're moving from "Infrastructure as Code" to what I call "Infrastructure as Conversation." The engineers who master this shift—who learn to direct AI effectively rather than just hoping for good results—will be the ones building the future.The C.R.A.F.T. framework isn't just about getting better AI outputs. It's about fundamentally changing how you work. It's about spending your time on architecture, strategy, and creative problem-solving, rather than wrestling with YAML syntax and boilerplate code.This article is based on concepts from my upcoming book "PromptOps: From YAML to AI" - a comprehensive guide to leveraging AI for DevOps workflows. The book covers everything from basic prompt engineering to building team-wide AI-assisted practices, with real-world examples for Kubernetes, CI/CD, cloud infrastructure, and more.

With more than six years of postdoctoral research in AI and Big Data Analytics, Dr. Mandal brings invaluable expertise to both our coursework and the ClinicTrends AI project.If that scenario doesn’t give you goosebumps… I’m not sure what will!
  
  
  How ClinicTrends AI Was Born
During my previous career, I worked with a dataset of over one million customer records, including more than three years of NPS-style survey responses from multiple aesthetic clinics I helped manage. That dataset included over 25,000 individual responses. The more I studied software engineering and machine learning, the more I became obsessed with one question:Can we turn raw customer feedback into actionable, real-time intelligence for businesses?That’s how  was born — and it’s already progressing into version 2.0!We just wrapped up , which includes:✅ A modular Streamlit web application architecturefour machine learning models for sentiment analysis:

While each serves its purpose, they often create silos, making it challenging to standardize, analyze, or even simply share content universally. Enter Markdown — a lightweight, easy-to-read, and easy-to-write syntax that’s rapidly become the lingua franca of documentation, notes, and web content.But what if you have a mountain of existing files you want to convert to this elegant, future-proof format? That’s the problem we set out to solve with markdownai.xyz.
  
  
  The Vision: Unlocking Content with Markdown
Our goal was simple yet ambitious: create a dead-simple web application that allows users to upload various local file formats and instantly convert them into clean, portable Markdown. We wanted to leverage the power of open source and modern AI-assisted development to make this vision a reality.
  
  
  The Conversion Engine: Microsoft’s Markitdown
At the heart of markdownai.xyz’s conversion prowess lies Microsoft’s Markitdown. This powerful, open-source library provides robust capabilities for parsing and rendering various document types into Markdown. It’s an unsung hero in the conversion world, offering the flexibility and reliability we needed to handle diverse input files.By integrating Markitdown into our backend, we could tap into its sophisticated parsing logic, ensuring that whether you upload a PDF with complex layouts or a simple Word document, the output Markdown is as accurate and readable as possible. Its open-source nature aligns perfectly with our ethos of leveraging community-driven tools.
  
  
  The Development Catalyst: Cursor & Same.new
Building a web application that handles file uploads, complex conversions, and delivers a seamless user experience can be daunting. This is where Cursor, an AI-first code editor, truly shone as our primary development tool.Cursor wasn’t just an editor; it was a tireless pair programmer. From the initial conceptualization of the file upload mechanism to integrating Markitdown’s APIs, Cursor’s AI capabilities assisted us every step of the way:Brainstorming & Scaffolding: We started by outlining the core features. Cursor helped us generate boilerplate code for the file upload endpoint, the conversion logic, and the user interface structure.Intelligent Code Generation: When faced with complex parsing challenges or error handling for different file types, we could simply describe the desired functionality in natural language, and Cursor would often generate accurate, efficient code snippets or even entire functions.Debugging & Refactoring: Identifying issues in file processing or optimizing the conversion pipeline became significantly faster. Cursor’s AI could analyze stack traces, suggest fixes, and propose refactoring opportunities to improve code quality and performance.Iterative Development with same.new: For quick prototyping and testing specific functionalities (like an isolated Markitdown conversion test), we frequently leveraged same.new. This allowed us to spin up development environments rapidly, test changes in isolation, and iterate on design decisions with remarkable speed, all while benefiting from Cursor’s contextual understanding of our project.The synergy between Cursor’s AI assistance and the rapid iteration possible with same.new significantly compressed our development cycle, allowing us to focus on the core problem of robust file conversion rather than getting bogged down in boilerplate or debugging.
  
  
  Our Robust Tech Stack & Deployment Pipeline
Beyond the core conversion logic and AI-assisted development, bringing markdownai.xyz to life required a suite of reliable tools for version control, hosting, and performance.GitHub: The Collaborative BackboneOur entire codebase resides on GitHub. It served as our central repository for version control, allowing us to track changes, collaborate seamlessly, and ensure the integrity of our project as it evolved.Render: Effortless DeploymentFor hosting and continuous deployment, we chose Render. Render simplifies the process of deploying web services, background workers, and databases. Its seamless integration with GitHub means every push to our main branch automatically triggers a new build and deployment, ensuring markdownai.xyz is always up-to-date with the latest features and bug fixes without manual intervention.Cloudflare: Performance, Security, and ReliabilityCloudflare became our indispensable partner for ensuring markdownai.xyz is fast, secure, and always available. We leveraged Cloudflare for:CDN (Content Delivery Network): Caching static assets closer to users, drastically reducing load times.DNS Management: Robust and fast DNS resolution for our domain.DDoS Protection: Shielding our application from malicious attacks.SSL/TLS: Providing a secure, encrypted connection for all user interactions.Spaceship: A Developer’s Best Friend (Indirectly)While not directly part of the markdownai.xyz runtime, a powerful command-line environment is crucial for developer productivity. For many, including ourselves, a tool like Spaceship (for ZSH) provides a highly customizable and information-rich prompt. It indirectly contributed by making the development experience more efficient and enjoyable when managing local files, Git operations, and interacting with remote servers.Google Search Console & Google Analytics (GA): Visibility & InsightsOnce markdownai.xyz was live, we wanted to ensure it could be discovered and that we understood how users interacted with it.Google Search Console helps us monitor our site’s search performance, identify indexing issues, and understand how Google sees our website.Google Analytics (GA) provides invaluable insights into user behavior: where they come from, which features they use most, and how long they stay. This data is crucial for continuous improvement and feature prioritization.
  
  
  The Seamless Deployment Journey with Cursor
The deployment of markdownai.xyz was also a process where Cursor’s AI proved incredibly valuable. While Render handles much of the heavy lifting, configuring environment variables, setting up build commands, or troubleshooting deployment logs can still be tricky.Generating Dockerfile configurations suitable for Render.Suggesting .env file structures for environment variables.Interpreting deployment logs and suggesting fixes for build failures.This end-to-end assistance from initial idea to live deployment truly demonstrated the power of AI in modern software development.

What Could Possibly Go Wrong?</title><link>https://dev.to/alexroor4/i-connected-chatgpt-to-smart-contracts-what-could-possibly-go-wrong-3e1g</link><author>Alex Roor</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 3 Jul 2025 09:35:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[TL;DR: I wanted to teach GPT how to interact with Ethereum. The result? An agent that can parse ABIs, call contract methods, and almost sent $50 to a random wallet. Almost.🤖 Why Put LLMs Into Web3?
I work at the intersection of AI and blockchain, and lately I’ve been wondering:
we still write contract.methods.transfer() manually,
while LLMs already build entire backends for us.So I built a prototype AI assistant that can:Interpret method signatures and data types;Act as a CLI helper or Telegram bot to interact with contracts for you.⚙️ Mini Stack
Node.js + ethers.js — to handle contract interactionsOpenAI API — to parse ABI and generate codeExpress.js — simple interface to test commands🧪 Test #1: Reading Contracts
I started with the ABI of USDT (classic ERC20).
Fed it to GPT-4 and asked:"What does the method transfer(address,uint256) do?"“This method sends tokens from the current account to a specified address…”✅ It worked. But GPT started hallucinating about return values and gas costs — so I tuned the temperature down.🧨 Test #2: Executing Transactions
Next step: use LLM to generate the full transfer code.
Prompted with something like:“Send 50 USDT to this address…”
→ await contract.transfer("0xabc...", ethers.utils.parseUnits("50", 6))Wrong decimal assumption (USDT uses 6, GPT assumed 18)Address was missing the 0xAt one point it suggested sending the entire balance via signer.getBalance()🧠 Lesson:
AI is a great co-pilot — but never let it hold the keys. Not yet.🔐 What's Next?
No, I’m not giving GPT my private key.
Transactions are only executed after explicit user confirmation.But imagine an AI acting like a DevOps assistant for Web3:Right now it’s just a CLI toy — but I already see the real-world use cases:AI interfaces for trackers (integrating with WhiteBIT API maybe? 👀);Voice control for non-coders: “send 20 tokens to Alex.”📌 Final Thoughts
Merging LLMs with Web3 is like handling two fireballs —
don’t leave them unattended,
but if you train them right, they could be the future of crypto UX.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>5 Hidden Gem Websites That Genuinely Boost Productivity (and a Bit of Fun Too)</title><link>https://dev.to/juddiy/5-hidden-gem-websites-that-genuinely-boost-productivity-and-a-bit-of-fun-too-2dii</link><author>Juddiy</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 3 Jul 2025 09:32:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Every now and then, I stumble upon a few sites that are so surprisingly useful—or just plain delightful—that I have to share them.

While understanding fundamental concepts is essential, the ability to apply those concepts in real-world situations is what truly sets successful professionals apart. That’s where hands-on practice comes in. It plays a crucial role in IT job training, bridging the gap between learning and doing, and preparing individuals for the challenges they will face in the workplace.Hands-on practice allows learners to go beyond passive learning and actively engage with the tools, technologies, and workflows they will encounter on the job. Whether it's writing and debugging code, setting up a virtual server, configuring network security, or analyzing datasets, practical experience reinforces theoretical knowledge and builds confidence. When students apply what they’ve learned in simulated or real environments, they gain a deeper understanding of how systems operate and how to troubleshoot problems effectively.One of the main benefits of hands-on IT training is the development of problem-solving skills. In a real-world IT setting, issues are rarely straightforward. Systems may behave unpredictably, software might conflict, or a network may fail at the worst possible time. Through hands-on practice, learners become accustomed to identifying issues, experimenting with solutions, and adapting to unexpected challenges. This kind of experiential learning cultivates resilience and critical thinking—qualities that are essential for any IT role.Hands-on experience also plays a vital role in skill retention. Studies show that people remember much more of what they do compared to what they only read or hear. By working on real or simulated projects, learners strengthen their memory of technical processes and commands. Repetition in a practical setting leads to mastery, and this mastery becomes evident during technical interviews, coding assessments, and, most importantly, on the job.Another advantage of hands-on practice is the ability to build a tangible portfolio. Many training programs now include project-based learning where students complete capstone assignments or develop their own tools and applications. These projects not only help reinforce technical skills but also give learners something concrete to showcase to potential employers. A well-documented GitHub repository or a portfolio of completed cloud architecture diagrams can be far more persuasive than a certificate alone.Employers increasingly look for candidates who can demonstrate real-world skills from day one. Certifications and academic degrees are important, but hiring managers often prioritize practical experience when assessing a candidate’s readiness. Training programs that incorporate labs, simulations, sandbox environments, or internships offer a significant advantage by mimicking workplace scenarios and helping learners transition smoothly into professional roles.In conclusion, hands-on practice is not a supplement to IT job training—it is a central pillar of it. It transforms passive knowledge into actionable skills, sharpens problem-solving ability, and builds the confidence needed to tackle complex technical tasks. For anyone serious about building a successful IT career, choosing a training program that prioritizes practical experience is not just beneficial—it’s essential.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Choose the Right IT Job Training for Your Career Goals</title><link>https://dev.to/rac/how-to-choose-the-right-it-job-training-for-your-career-goals-3kil</link><author>Zack Rac</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 3 Jul 2025 09:18:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In a constantly evolving digital world, IT job training has become a vital stepping stone for anyone aiming to start or advance their tech career. With countless courses, bootcamps, and certification programs available, choosing the right training can be overwhelming. The key to making a smart choice lies in aligning your selection with your career goals, current skill level, and long-term ambitions.The first step in choosing the right IT training is understanding what you want from your career. If you're a beginner looking to break into the industry, your focus should be on foundational skills that introduce you to core concepts like programming, networking, or technical support. Programs such as entry-level certificates or introductory bootcamps can provide a strong start. On the other hand, if you’re already working in tech and want to move into a more specialized role—such as data science, cloud computing, or cybersecurity—then an advanced or niche-focused program may be more appropriate.Your existing knowledge and experience should also influence your decision. Training programs vary in difficulty, and selecting one that matches your current level ensures you’re not overwhelmed or under-challenged. For instance, someone with no coding experience would benefit more from a beginner Python course than from a full-stack development bootcamp. Likewise, a network administrator with years of experience might look to gain a certification like the Cisco CCNP rather than start with CCNA.The format and flexibility of the training program also matter. Full-time bootcamps may be great for those who can dedicate several weeks to immersive learning, while online self-paced courses suit professionals balancing study with a full-time job. Mentorship and hands-on projects can add significant value by allowing you to apply what you've learned in practical scenarios. Some programs even offer job placement assistance, which can be a deciding factor if you're aiming for immediate employment after completing your training.Another important consideration is the credibility and industry recognition of the program. Certifications from well-known tech companies like Google, Amazon Web Services, Cisco, or Microsoft tend to carry more weight with employers. Likewise, platforms like Coursera, edX, and Springboard often collaborate with industry leaders to deliver job-relevant content. Before committing, it’s worth researching whether the program’s graduates have successfully secured roles in your desired field.Cost is another practical factor that shouldn’t be overlooked. While some training programs are free or affordable, others can be expensive. However, the right training should be seen as an investment. If a program significantly enhances your skills, offers career support, and increases your earning potential, it can deliver a strong return on investment over time.Ultimately, the best IT training program is the one that brings you closer to your career objectives. It should be tailored to your interests, your learning style, and your timeline. Whether you aim to become a software developer, a cloud architect, a cybersecurity analyst, or a data scientist, selecting the right path ensures that your time and effort lead to meaningful, measurable progress. Making an informed decision now can accelerate your career and open up opportunities in the dynamic world of technology.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Security Risk Assessment: Strengthening Data Access Management with Cloud Security Consulting Services</title><link>https://dev.to/onixcloud/security-risk-assessment-strengthening-data-access-management-with-cloud-security-consulting-no</link><author>Onix Cloud</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 3 Jul 2025 08:58:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In today’s digital age, conducting a thorough security risk assessment is essential for organizations to identify potential vulnerabilities, protect sensitive data, and ensure robust compliance. With increasing data breaches and cyber threats, businesses must prioritize comprehensive security strategies to safeguard their cloud environments.

Let's talk about something that's been on my mind lately. You know how we're all obsessed with finding the next big thing to boost our sales? Well, what if I told you that the secret weapon you need is probably already sitting right there in your customer service toolkit – your AI chatbot.I'm talking to you from the trenches here at Destinova AI Labs, where we've been building chatbots for Shopify, Magento, and WooCommerce stores for years. And let me tell you, we've seen some pretty amazing transformations happen when store owners start paying attention to what their chatbots are actually telling them.
  
  
  Your Chatbot Is Like Having a 24/7 Market Researcher
Think about it this way – every single day, your chatbot is having hundreds, maybe thousands of conversations with your customers. Each chat is like a mini-interview where people are telling you exactly what they want, what confuses them, and what's stopping them from buying.Most store owners see their chatbot as just a customer service tool. But here's the thing – it's actually the best market research tool you've never fully used. Every question a customer asks, every complaint they make, every product they inquire about – it's all valuable data that's just waiting to be analyzed.
  
  
  What Your Customers Are Really Telling You
Let me share what we've learned from working with hundreds of e-commerce stores. When we dive into chatbot conversation data, we usually find gold mines of insights that store owners had no idea existed.The Product Questions That Keep Coming UpYou know that feeling when you keep getting asked the same question over and over? Your chatbot data will show you exactly which products are causing confusion. Maybe customers can't figure out sizing, or they're not sure about compatibility, or they just need more details about how something works.One of our clients discovered that 40% of their chatbot conversations were about whether their phone cases would fit specific phone models. They had no idea this was such a big issue until they looked at the data. The solution? They created a simple compatibility checker right on their product pages. Sales went up 25% in the next month.The Pain Points You Didn't Know ExistedHere's something that might surprise you – customers will tell a chatbot things they'd never mention in a review or email. There's something about that instant, conversational format that makes people more honest about their frustrations.We had a client selling home fitness equipment who kept getting chatbot questions about assembly difficulty. Turns out, people were worried about putting together complicated equipment, but they weren't mentioning this in product reviews. The store started highlighting their "easy assembly" features and even created video guides. Problem solved, confidence boosted, sales increased.The Buying Patterns You're MissingYour chatbot interactions can reveal buying patterns that your regular analytics might miss. Maybe people are asking about bulk discounts way more than you realized. Or perhaps they're interested in gift wrapping options that you don't currently offer.
  
  
  Turning Conversations Into Marketing Gold
Now here's where it gets really interesting. All those customer conversations aren't just helpful for customer service – they're a treasure trove of marketing insights.Finding Your Real Customer LanguageYou know how sometimes we get so caught up in our own product descriptions that we forget how normal people actually talk about our stuff? Your chatbot conversations show you the exact words and phrases your customers use when they're looking for your products.If customers keep asking about "waterproof mascara" but you're calling it "long-lasting formula," guess what? You should probably update your product titles and descriptions to match how people actually search and think about your products.Discovering New Content IdeasEvery question your chatbot gets is essentially a blog post idea or FAQ waiting to happen. If people keep asking about the difference between two similar products, that's a comparison guide. If they're confused about how to use something, that's a how-to video.We've seen stores create entire content marketing strategies based on their most common chatbot questions. It's brilliant because you know for sure that people are actually interested in this information – they're asking about it every single day!
  
  
  Product Development Insights That Actually Matter
Here's something that blew my mind when I first realized it – your chatbot is probably the best product development advisor you'll ever have. Customers are literally telling you what they wish your products could do differently.The Features People Actually WantInstead of guessing what features to add to your products, your chatbot data tells you exactly what customers are looking for. Maybe they keep asking if your backpack comes in a bigger size, or if your software has a specific integration, or if your skincare product is suitable for sensitive skin.These aren't just random questions – they're market research telling you exactly where your product gaps are and what you should focus on next.The Complaints That Point to OpportunitiesWhen customers complain to your chatbot, they're giving you a roadmap for improvement. Maybe they love your product but hate the packaging, or they think your return policy is too strict, or they wish you offered faster shipping.Each complaint is actually an opportunity to differentiate yourself from competitors and make your customers happier.
  
  
  Making Your Sales Strategy Smarter
All this data isn't just interesting – it's actionable. Here's how smart store owners are using chatbot insights to completely transform their sales strategies.Timing Your Promotions BetterYour chatbot data can show you when people are most interested in certain products. Maybe questions about winter coats start ramping up in September, or people start asking about gift cards in November. This timing data helps you plan your marketing calendar and inventory better.Personalizing Your ApproachWhen you understand the common questions and concerns for different types of customers, you can create more targeted marketing messages. First-time buyers might need more educational content, while returning customers might be more interested in new arrivals or exclusive offers.Improving Your Sales FunnelIf you notice that people often ask about return policies or shipping costs right before they're about to buy, you can make sure this information is more prominent in your checkout process. Remove the friction, increase the conversions.
  
  
  The Technical Side (Don't Worry, It's Not Complicated)
Now, I know what you're thinking – "This sounds great, but how do I actually get all this data and make sense of it?" The good news is that most modern chatbot platforms (including the ones we build at Destinova AI Labs) come with built-in analytics that make this pretty straightforward. You don't need to be a data scientist to spot patterns and trends.Start simple. Look at your most frequently asked questions, your most common keywords, and the conversations that happen right before someone makes a purchase or abandons their cart. These are usually the most revealing.The key is to review this data regularly – maybe once a week or once a month – and always ask yourself: "What can I do with this information?" If customers keep asking about sizing, improve your size guides. If they're confused about shipping, make your shipping information clearer.
  
  
  Real Results From Real Stores
Let me share a quick story about one of our clients that really shows the power of this approach. They were a small jewelry store struggling with cart abandonment. Their chatbot data showed that people were asking tons of questions about jewelry care and maintenance right before checkout.Instead of just answering these questions, they created a comprehensive care guide and started including a care kit with every purchase. Not only did their cart abandonment rate drop by 30%, but their average order value increased because people felt more confident about their purchase.Another client discovered through their chatbot that customers were really interested in sustainable packaging, even though they'd never specifically marketed themselves as eco-friendly. They switched to biodegradable packaging and started highlighting their environmental efforts. Sales increased 40% in the next quarter.Here's the thing about using chatbot insights for your sales strategy – it's not a one-time fix. It's an ongoing process of listening to your customers and adapting based on what they're telling you.The stores that do this consistently are the ones that stay ahead of trends, solve problems before they become big issues, and build stronger relationships with their customers. They're not just selling products; they're creating experiences that people actually want.So here's what I want you to do after you finish reading this. Go check your chatbot analytics. Look at the last week's conversations. I guarantee you'll find at least one insight that could improve your store.Maybe it's a product description that needs clarifying, or a new FAQ that should be added to your website, or a marketing message that could be more targeted. Whatever it is, act on it. Your customers are already telling you how to serve them better – you just need to listen.Remember, every conversation your chatbot has is a customer giving you free advice about how to run your business better. That's incredibly valuable information that most of your competitors are probably ignoring.Your AI chatbot isn't just a customer service tool – it's a strategic business asset that can transform how you understand and serve your customers.

(Spoiler: They’ve Already Started Digging the Grave)</title><link>https://dev.to/hotfixhero/will-ai-agents-kill-apis-and-will-ai-agents-kill-apis-and-ipaasipaas-spoiler-theyve-already-4c2h</link><author>HotfixHero</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 3 Jul 2025 08:05:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Let’s face it: developers have spent the last 20 years building a giant house of cards made of REST endpoints, OAuth tokens, Swagger docs, and iPaaS spaghetti flows. We call it "integration." And we pretend it scales. But then comes a new requirement, and boom—your neat Zapier setup now needs six retries, conditional logic, and a prayer.Enter AI agents. Not some glorified chatbot. We’re talking about LLM-powered workflows that dynamically fetch, transform, and route data based on intent. They don’t care about your beautiful OpenAPI spec. They care that someone said, “Hey, send me the leads from Salesforce that signed up last week and post them in Slack. Oh, and format them nicely."And you know what? The agent does it.It figures out how to auth. It constructs the right queries. It handles the formatting. It even adds a joke to the Slack message if you want. Without a dev ever opening Postman or clicking through Boomi's drag-and-drop hell.We’re entering a new paradigm where APIs don’t go away, but they become background noise. Hidden plumbing. Agents become the face of integrations. You don’t tell an engineer what API to hit anymore—you tell the agent what you want, and it orchestrates the calls dynamically. Welcome to PromptOps.Does this mean APIs are dead? Nah. You still need them. But you might not need to  about them. Just like TCP/IP still exists, but most devs don’t handcraft their packets. The abstraction layer just moved up again. And iPaaS? That’s going to feel like trying to build a Tesla by dragging icons around in PowerPoint.Security, observability, and debugging will need a rethink. Prompt-based agents are flexible, but they’re also opaque. It’s one thing to trace a Zapier run. It's another to figure out why your AI agent skipped half your customer list because it misunderstood "recent."So no, APIs aren’t going extinct. They’re just getting demoted. The future isn’t a better REST client. It’s an AI that doesn’t need one.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Access to Gemini Model</title><link>https://dev.to/olatunjiayodel9/access-to-gemini-model-3d84</link><author>Olatunji Ayodele Abidemi</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 3 Jul 2025 07:44:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Large-Scale City Simulation using LLM agents</title><link>https://dev.to/skarwlk/large-scale-city-simulation-using-llm-agents-3bjg</link><author>skarwlk</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 3 Jul 2025 07:26:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Large-Scale City Simulation using LLM agents]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[Boost] Towards City Simulation using LLM Agents</title><link>https://dev.to/skarwlk/-1lbl</link><author>skarwlk</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 3 Jul 2025 07:00:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Large-Scale City Simulation using LLM agents]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Large-Scale City Simulation using LLM agents</title><link>https://dev.to/skarwlk/large-scale-city-simulation-using-llm-agents-3kj8</link><author>skarwlk</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 3 Jul 2025 06:59:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Urban planning, social science, and behavioral studies have long sought realistic simulations of human behavior within urban environments. Traditional agent-based simulations, however, often fall short, relying on rigid, handcrafted rules that can't capture the complexities of human intentions and adaptive behaviors.CitySim emerges as a groundbreaking framework, integrating large language models (LLMs) to simulate realistic, adaptive urban behavior on an unprecedented scale.CitySim leverages advances in large language models (like GPT-4o) to create agents that act and interact realistically within a virtual urban environment. These agents are equipped with:: Each agent has demographic attributes, personality traits, and preferences derived from real-world surveys.Recursive Value-Driven Planning: Agents dynamically generate daily schedules considering mandatory tasks, personal habits, situational factors, and intrinsic desires.Long-Term Goals and Memory: Agents maintain evolving beliefs, long-term aspirations, and memories that affect their decisions and interactions over time.
  
  
  Cognitive State Representation
CitySim agents are initialized with detailed personas derived from survey data, including demographic attributes (age, occupation, education), personality traits (Big Five), and habitual behaviors (e.g., meal timings, leisure activities).: Chronological records of daily events.: Agents synthesize daily events into higher-level insights.: Beliefs about visited locations, updated through direct observations and similarity-based inference.Upon visiting a location, agents form subjective appraisals based on their persona and context, continuously refining their beliefs about different city locations.Agents make sophisticated decisions regarding their daily movements:: Filling schedules starting from mandatory activities, down to leisure activities based on their intrinsic values.: A belief-weighted gravity model guides location choices, balancing personal preferences and proximity.: Transportation mode is chosen by evaluating factors like distance, time, weather, and individual preferences.CitySim agents form dynamic social relationships, maintaining evolving beliefs about affinity, trust, and familiarity with others, leading to realistic face-to-face and online interactions.CitySim significantly outperforms traditional and other LLM-based simulation frameworks in multiple dimensions:Agents' daily schedules closely match real-world survey data, demonstrating realistic macro-level patterns of human activities.CitySim agents were consistently rated as more human-like than agents from other leading frameworks, thanks to adaptive, context-sensitive behaviors.Simulated travel data from CitySim closely aligns with real-world patterns, accurately reflecting peaks and troughs in urban mobility.CitySim effectively models pedestrian crowd density, closely matching real-world data in major urban areas.Despite its strengths, CitySim inherits potential biases from underlying LLMs and may occasionally produce inaccuracies. Ethical considerations include the risk of amplifying biases or influencing real-world urban policies without adequate human oversight.CitySim represents a significant advancement towards realistic city-scale simulation, enabling nuanced insights into human urban behaviors, beneficial for research, urban planning, and policy-making.CitySim sets a new standard in agent-based modeling, moving beyond rigid rules and embracing the adaptability and complexity of human behaviors.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenTab Research Preview – Paid Opportunity</title><link>https://dev.to/opentab_e925dc5957f1a901e/opentab-research-preview-paid-opportunity-3b4g</link><author>OpenTab</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 3 Jul 2025 06:52:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We’re a research preview for OpenTab, a next-edit LLM extension for VSCode.Use it on a personal or side project for ~1 weekGet a $180 Amazon gift cardTo improve OpenTab’s models, we collect limited telemetry including structural edits, prompt interactions, and small surrounding snippets.

As developers and businesses race to build powerful, autonomous AI agents capable of handling complex tasks, LangChain has positioned itself at the center of this revolution bridging language models with tools, memory, APIs, and real-world applications. In this blog, we explore how LangChain is reshaping AI Agent Development, what makes it different from traditional frameworks, and how businesses can harness it for intelligent app ecosystems.The shift toward intelligent agents autonomous software entities that can reason, act, and learn—has been brewing for years. But the arrival of large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT series has significantly accelerated this progress. The problem, however, has been connecting these powerful LLMs to external tools, structured data, APIs, and memory—without writing large amounts of custom logic.
That’s where LangChain comes in.What Is LangChain?
LangChain is an open-source framework designed to enable AI development by connecting language models to external environments. It allows developers to build AI agents that can interact with data sources, call APIs, use tools, retain memory, and even make decisions autonomously.
At its core, LangChain serves as a middleware layer between an LLM (like GPT-4 or Claude) and real-world functionality. It enables agents to go beyond text generation by giving them the tools they need to observe, reason, and act—key components of agentic AI development.LangChain is built in Python and JavaScript, making it easy to integrate into web development and app development workflows. Its modular architecture provides plug-and-play capabilities for things like:
Memory managementRetrieval from vector databasesWhether you're building a customer service bot, a research assistant, or a dynamic knowledge worker, LangChain provides the scaffolding to make your AI Agent Development scalable, modular, and production-ready.Why LangChain Matters for AI Agent DevelopmentBridging LLMs and Real-World Tasks
Traditional LLMs are great at language generation but fall short when it comes to interacting with APIs, databases, or dynamic environments. LangChain solves this by enabling agents to take actions beyond just generating text. This means your AI agent can search documents, call an API, summarize content, query a SQL database, and return results—all in one flow.
For instance, imagine a travel app where a user says, “Book me a flight from Mumbai to Dubai next Friday morning, and find a hotel with a sea view under ₹10,000.” A LangChain-powered agent can parse this input, use plugins to access flight and hotel APIs, reason through the options, and execute the booking—all autonomously.
This is the very essence of modern AI Agent Development—creating agents that can understand intent and perform complex tasks reliably.Tool Use and Agentic Reasoning
A key innovation in LangChain is its ability to allow agents to use tools—functions that perform specific tasks such as searching the web, running calculations, querying databases, or translating documents.
With the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) model built into LangChain, agents don’t just act randomly—they plan their steps. They decide what tool to use, gather intermediate information, and then refine their final response. This mirrors how humans solve problems and opens the door for more sophisticated use cases in AI chatbot development, virtual assistants, or customer support agents.The LangChain Agent Framework
LangChain’s architecture is modular and extensible. At the heart of its power is the Agent Framework, which includes:
LLMChains: Core units combining a language model with prompts.Agents: Agents use LLMChains and decide which tools to invoke based on input.Memory: Persistent memory to retain context across interactions.Tools: Modular functions (e.g., Python REPL, API calls, vector search).Retrievers: Connect agents to documents stored in vector databases like Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS.This flexible setup makes it easy to build agents that perform multi-step reasoning. For example, an internal knowledge agent can retrieve documents, summarize them, and respond to queries with contextual memory—perfect for HR platforms, SaaS dashboards, or support tools.AI Agent Development Company + LangChain = Faster MVPs
For startups and enterprises building AI-first products, partnering with an AI Agent Development company that specializes in LangChain can significantly reduce time to market. Instead of reinventing the wheel, these firms leverage LangChain’s reusable components to create production-grade agents with:
Data integration (SQL, MongoDB, Google Sheets)Context-aware conversationsExternal API orchestration (CRMs, ERPs, CMS)Chat and voice interfacesReal-time analytics and feedback loopsWhether it’s a fintech startup creating a portfolio management assistant or a legal tech firm building a contract summarization bot, LangChain enables high-level functionality with minimal code.Real-World Applications of LangChain in AI Agent DevelopmentE-Commerce Chatbots
LangChain allows AI chatbot development for e-commerce brands to go beyond static menus. Agents can access real-time inventory data, fetch customer purchase history, suggest personalized products, and process orders directly through APIs. With memory modules, the bot can remember past preferences and follow up intelligently.Healthcare Assistants
Healthcare apps can embed LangChain-powered agents to collect symptoms, suggest doctors, schedule appointments, and follow up post-visit. With strict privacy protocols and custom software development, these agents remain HIPAA/GDPR-compliant.Enterprise Knowledge Workers
LangChain enables enterprise AI agents that can retrieve and summarize internal documents, analyze spreadsheets, generate reports, and even make decisions. It’s revolutionizing how companies automate research, compliance, and documentation.Travel and Hospitality
Agents powered by LangChain can handle itinerary planning, ticket booking, and multi-step customer queries. They can compare prices, check weather, book reservations, and offer itinerary PDFs—all from a single interaction.LangChain and the Agentic AI Movement
Agentic AI development refers to the trend of building autonomous agents that operate in complex environments, make decisions, and coordinate across systems. LangChain is foundational to this movement because it supports:
Multi-agent collaboration (e.g., research agent + scheduling agent)Tool use with feedback loopsLong-term memory and contextual understandingDynamic decision-making based on stateAs AI ecosystems grow more modular and intelligent, LangChain serves as the operating system for deploying fleets of intelligent agents—each specializing in different domains but working together to achieve business goals.Opportunities for App and Web Development
LangChain isn’t just a backend tool—it can be seamlessly integrated into app development and web development workflows. Developers can use LangChain agents in:
React Native or Flutter apps for mobile assistanceNext.js or Vue.js web apps with intelligent chat widgetsNode.js backends for conversational APIsCross-platform tools via RESTful API wrappersThis flexibility means businesses can infuse existing digital products with intelligent agents without major architecture overhauls.
For businesses that already have customer-facing apps, embedding LangChain-powered AI agents opens up massive UX improvements—context-aware interactions, dynamic recommendations, and proactive nudges.Challenges and Considerations
While LangChain offers a powerful toolkit, it’s not a silver bullet. Companies must consider:Prompt Engineering Complexity
Designing effective prompts is both art and science. Incorrect prompt chains can lead to hallucinations or brittle logic. Careful tuning and testing are required for reliability.Latency and Performance
Because LangChain often involves calling LLM APIs + additional tools, response time can increase. For real-time applications, caching, streaming, and minimal toolchains must be considered.Security and Access Controls
When agents call APIs or interact with sensitive data, secure authentication, rate limiting, and permission models are essential. Partnering with an AI Agent Development company ensures these systems are built with enterprise-grade compliance.Debugging and Observability
With multi-step reasoning and tool usage, tracing agent decisions becomes complex. Developers must implement logs, step outputs, and fallback logic to ensure observability and trust.The Future of LangChain and AI Agent Development
LangChain is evolving rapidly. Its roadmap includes deeper integration with vector databases, improved memory modules, support for multiple language models, agent collaboration, and more open standards.
In the near future, we’ll likely see:
Drag-and-drop LangChain agents for no-code platformsMultimodal agents combining voice, image, and textAgent marketplaces with plug-and-play workflowsFederated agent networks across business unitsAs more companies realize the power of intelligent agents, LangChain will become an integral part of enterprise tech stacks—just like databases and cloud services are today.Conclusion
LangChain is not just a tool it’s a catalyst for the next generation of intelligent software. By empowering agents to reason, access tools, use memory, and act autonomously, LangChain has become a foundational framework for modern AI Agent Development.
For startups, enterprises, and product teams looking to build the future, adopting LangChain means accelerating innovation, improving user experiences, and creating software that thinks.
Partnering with an experienced AI Agent Development company can unlock LangChain’s full potential through architecture planning, custom integration, and scalable deployment. With the right expertise and the right tools, your next AI agent could be just weeks away from production.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🎓 Smart Study Buddy – AI-Powered Study Assistant</title><link>https://dev.to/ahc_hasanga_ee09aa1fbd/smart-study-buddy-ai-powered-study-assistant-4m5</link><author>Chathura Abeywickrama</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 3 Jul 2025 06:44:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I built Smart Study Buddy, a personalized study assistant app using Google AI Studio and Gemini.

Hello DEV Community! I'm excited to share my experience participating in the World's Largest Hackathon, where I embarked on a fascinating project called 'FUTURE ECHOES'. This project is a virtual prototype designed to deliver and simulate the discovery of messages from various futuristic eras using text-to-speech technology. My goal was to explore how AI could help us "unearth" and interpret hypothetical historical data from a time far beyond our own, and bring a unique, imaginative twist to the hackathon's themes by allowing users to hear voices from the future.The Development Journey: Bringing Voices from the Future to Life
The journey of building 'FUTURE ECHOES' began with a simple yet ambitious idea: to create an interactive experience where users could literally "hear" messages from different points in the future. I envisioned a clean, intuitive web interface that would present these messages and allow for their auditory playback.My primary development environment for this hackathon was Bolt.new. I found Bolt.new to be an incredibly powerful and user-friendly platform, especially for a fast-paced event like a hackathon. Its instant setup meant I could dive straight into coding without wrestling with local environment configurations. The real-time collaborative features were also invaluable, enabling seamless iteration and feedback.The core of 'FUTURE ECHOES' was built using:HTML: For the basic structure and layout.CSS: For styling, ensuring a modern and responsive design. I focused on creating a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate interface.JavaScript (React): For the interactive elements and managing the application's state. React's component-based approach helped keep the UI organized and maintainable.The development process involved:Conceptualization: Defining the futuristic eras and crafting initial messages.UI Design: Laying out the user interface to be clean and engaging.Core Logic: Implementing the message display and the button to trigger speech.API Integration: Connecting to the text-to-speech service to convert the messages into audio.Bolt.new's integrated environment significantly streamlined this process, allowing for rapid prototyping and immediate visual feedback as I built out each feature.
AI-Powered Development & Challenges: Learning and Overcoming
The heart of 'FUTURE ECHOES' lies in its AI-powered text-to-speech functionality. This was where the project truly came alive, allowing the abstract concept of "messages from the future" to become an auditory reality.My experience with AI-powered development was incredibly insightful. Using the ElevenLabs API for text-to-speech was a key decision, providing natural-sounding voices that enhanced the immersive quality of the messages. Integrating this API involved:Asynchronous Handling: Ensuring the audio generation and playback happened smoothly without freezing the user interface.State Management: Carefully managing the 'speaking' state to prevent multiple audio playbacks and provide clear feedback to the user (e.g., changing the button text from "Hear Message" to "Speaking...").However, like any real-world project, we encountered our share of challenges. One significant hurdle was related to API key management and environment variables. Initially, there were difficulties ensuring the API key was correctly loaded and accessible, which caused some frustration during development and deployment. This taught me the critical importance of proper environment configuration for secure and functional API integration.Another challenge, particularly during the submission phase for the hackathon, involved video recording and editing. We faced technical issues that prevented us from creating a perfectly polished demonstration video with all the intended enhancements. This was a valuable lesson in anticipating and adapting to unexpected technical difficulties, especially under time pressure. Despite these issues, the core functionality of 'FUTURE ECHOES' remained robust.
Key Learnings & Takeaways: Growth Through Building
Participating in the World's Largest Hackathon and building 'FUTURE ECHOES' was an incredibly enriching experience. Beyond the code, I gained several valuable insights:Mastering Rapid Prototyping: The hackathon environment, combined with the efficiency of Bolt.new, truly honed my ability to quickly translate ideas into a functional prototype. This agility is invaluable in any development scenario.Deep Dive into AI APIs: Working hands-on with the ElevenLabs API for text-to-speech provided a practical understanding of integrating advanced AI services. I learned about asynchronous operations, error handling, and optimizing API calls for a smooth user experience.Importance of Environment Management: The challenges with API key configuration highlighted the critical need for robust environment variable management, especially when deploying applications that rely on external services. This is a key security and operational best practice.Resilience in the Face of Technical Glitches: Encountering issues with video recording and other technical hurdles taught me the importance of adaptability and problem-solving under pressure. It's a reminder that not everything goes perfectly, and learning to navigate those moments is part of the developer journey.The Power of Creative Application: 'FUTURE ECHOES' allowed me to combine a futuristic concept with practical AI implementation, demonstrating how technology can be used not just for utility, but also for imaginative and thought-provoking experiences.This hackathon was not just about building a project; it was about building skills, confidence, and a deeper appreciation for the possibilities of AI in web development.
What's Next for Future Echoes: The Journey Continues
'FUTURE ECHOES' is just the beginning of a journey into interactive future exploration. I'm excited about its potential and have several ideas for future enhancements:Expanded Content & Eras: Introduce a wider variety of time capsules, themes, and "eras" with more diverse messages and even different voice profiles to enhance the user's journey through the future.User Contribution & Interaction: Implement features allowing users to contribute their own "future echoes" or interact with existing ones, fostering a community around the concept. This could involve user accounts and a moderation system.Advanced AI Integration: Explore further integration with generative AI models to dynamically create new "future echoes" based on user prompts or specific themes, offering an infinitely expanding library of insights.Visual Enhancements & Animations: Incorporate more dynamic visual elements, subtle animations, and perhaps even 3D elements to make the experience even more immersive and captivating.Multi-language Support: Extend text-to-speech capabilities and content to support multiple languages, broadening the app's accessibility and global appeal.

Think of it as trying to convince people to eat sushi for the first time in a land where only burgers exist. At Panto AI, we’ve been on this rollercoaster, and we’re here to spill the secrets, share some industry legends, and sprinkle in the numbers that matter.
  
  
  What Does Market Creation Really Look Like?
Imagine walking into a party and introducing a dance nobody’s seen before. Some people stare. Some try it out. Most just keep doing the Macarena. That’s market creation: you’re not just selling a better mousetrap — you’re teaching people why they need a cat.Getting users to see the magic in your product is like waiting for popcorn to pop. You show them the demo, their eyes widen, and suddenly —  — they get it. But until that moment, you’re just waving around unpopped kernels.Even after that “aha!” moment, don’t expect people to change overnight. Remember when Netflix tried to get everyone to stream instead of rent DVDs? It took time, a lot of reminders, and maybe a few gentle nudges (okay, a lot of nudges).
  
  
  Real-World Legends Who Changed the Game
Let’s look at some fearless pioneers who didn’t just join the party; they  the music. Before 2007, phones were for calling and texting. Then Apple dropped the iPhone, and suddenly, everyone wanted to swipe, tap, and download apps. Over 1.2 billion iPhones sold in the first decade — talk about a dance craze catching on. Remember mailing DVDs? Netflix ditched the red envelopes and streamed its way into 260 million living rooms worldwide. Now, “Netflix and chill” is practically a lifestyle. Before GoPro, strapping a camera to your helmet sounded like a bad idea. Now, it’s the go-to for every thrill-seeker. They turned action cams into a $1.18 billion business by 2022.Impossible Foods & Beyond Meat: They didn’t just make veggie burgers — they made plant-based meat cool, racking up over $1.5 billion in combined revenue in 2023. In 2016, Jio made high-speed mobile internet so cheap in India that 100 million people signed up in just six months. That’s not just market creation — that’s a digital stampede.
  
  
  How to Survive (and Thrive) in Market Creation
 People love their routines. Be patient — it takes time to get folks off the Macarena and onto your new groove. Demos are great, but help people  using your product. Paint a picture. Tell a story. Show, don’t just tell. Keep checking in, offering tips, and celebrating wins. Netflix didn’t stop after launch — they kept adding shows and features to keep us hooked. When someone “gets it,” shout it from the rooftops. Success stories are contagious.Market creation is a wild ride — full of surprises, setbacks, and those sweet moments when everything clicks. Panto AI is dedicated to helping developers code better and ship faster through smarter code reviews. With over 500 developers using Panto AI for code review and more than 5 million lines of code reviewed, the impact of Panto AI’s approach is clear. Stick with it, keep things fun, and who knows? Maybe your product will be the next big thing everyone can’t live without.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🧠 Convert Design to Elementor Template with AI (Step-by-Step Guide)</title><link>https://dev.to/shahibur_rahman_6670cd024/convert-image-to-elementor-template-with-ai-step-by-step-guide-967</link><author>Shahibur Rahman</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 3 Jul 2025 04:28:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[⚡ The Elementor Powerhouse Meets AI AutomationElementor makes WordPress design easy—drag, drop, done.

The risk of missing prior art doesn’t just threaten validity; it can undermine entire product launches, invite litigation, and damage reputations. For patent attorneys, IP professionals, inventors, and innovation leaders, a thorough prior art search isn’t just a checkbox; it’s a .But why do incomplete searches happen so often? From language barriers and hidden non-patent literature (NPL) to outdated search methods, obstacles are numerous and often underestimated. Today’s innovation landscape demands more than traditional approaches; it requires advanced, globally informed strategies.In this comprehensive guide, we explore why the risk of missing prior art remains high, examine consequences, and share actionable best practices. We also touch on advanced tools like PatentScan and Traindex, which offer semantic and AI-powered approaches to help professionals stay ahead.
  
  
  The Consequences of Missing Prior Art
When a crucial piece of prior art slips through the cracks, the fallout can be dramatic and expensive. Imagine investing hundreds of thousands in drafting, filing, and prosecuting a patent, only to have it invalidated because of an overlooked article or manual.
  
  
  Patent Rejections and Delays
If missed prior art is found during prosecution, it can trigger new office actions, require amendments, or lead to narrower claims, weakening patent strength. Studies show patents with multiple office actions have significantly lower enforceability.
  
  
  Post-Grant Invalidations and Litigation Risk
Over 70% of patents invalidated in court are due to undiscovered prior art. Litigation can cost millions, and invalidation nullifies enforcement rights. High-profile cases like Apple vs. Samsung highlight how prior art can turn legal tides.
  
  
  Business and Investment Fallout
Invalidations impact business strategies and investor confidence. In pharma, Paragraph IV challenges use prior art to reduce exclusivity periods, while missing prior art can delay generic entry, creating long-term risks.
  
  
  Ethical and Professional Liability
Patent professionals face ethical scrutiny for incomplete searches. Missing known prior art can lead to malpractice claims or legal penalties. Inventors also have a duty to disclose through an Information Disclosure Statement (IDS). Treating searches as strategic intelligence gathering transforms IP from a defensive task to a proactive asset.
  
  
  Why Incomplete Prior Art Searches Happen

  
  
  Over-Reliance on Limited Databases
Many searches rely on limited databases or only Boolean operators, missing disclosures using unexpected terms or found in NPL.Technical language evolves rapidly, and different industries or regions describe technologies differently, widening gaps.
  
  
  Hidden “Secret” Prior Art
Unpublished filings (secret springing prior art) can invalidate patents. Recent Federal Circuit decisions reinforce this risk.Conference papers, standards, and trade disclosures often contain critical early evidence, yet are frequently missed.
  
  
  Language and Regional Barriers
Non-English disclosures and global filings are major blind spots, especially without translation or regional expertise.
  
  
  Best Practices for Comprehensive Prior Art Searches

  
  
  Develop a Multi-Layered Strategy
Combine keyword and classification approaches with semantic and AI-powered tools. Platforms like PatentScan and Traindex help uncover hidden connections and synonyms efficiently.
  
  
  Verify Metadata and Source Documents
Check dates and original documents to avoid false positives and gaps.
  
  
  Include NPL and Foreign Sources
Proactively search NPL and foreign filings to close hidden gaps.
  
  
  Partner with Professional Search Firms
Human insight complements AI. External firms provide independent analysis and risk assessment.
  
  
  Foster Team Communication
Legal, technical, and business teams should align on terminology and market implications to improve search depth. See searches as , updated regularly to inform ongoing strategy.Missed prior art jeopardizes patents at all stages, from filing to enforcement.Common causes include database limits, evolving terms, and NPL gaps.AI and semantic tools reduce the risk of missing prior art and improve quality.Verification and metadata checks are critical to avoid errors.Proactive searches support strategic business decisions, not just legal compliance.Tools like PatentScan and Traindex can complement traditional methods, adding deeper insight.The risk of missing prior art is more than a technical error; it’s a critical business and legal risk. From narrowed claims to costly litigation, its impact can dismantle entire strategies.A robust approach using AI, semantic tools, thorough NPL inclusion, and periodic updates can greatly reduce this risk. Platforms like PatentScan and Traindex help IP teams broaden searches and identify threats early, complementing professional expertise and in-house knowledge. Review your search strategies, integrate advanced tools, and adopt a proactive, intelligence-driven approach. Protect your innovations and secure a stronger future.
  
  
  Why is the risk of missing prior art so high?
Disclosures in unexpected places, language barriers, evolving terminology, and overlooked NPL make thorough coverage difficult.
  
  
  What mistakes lead to incomplete prior art searches?
Over-reliance on single databases, ignoring NPL, not using AI tools, and failing to review global publications are common mistakes.
  
  
  Can startups avoid incomplete searches affordably?
Yes. Layered strategies using affordable databases, AI tools like PatentScan or Traindex, and early technical team involvement help mitigate risk.
  
  
  Why is NPL important in reducing risk?
NPL often contains early disclosures vital for novelty assessments and minimizing post-grant challenges.
  
  
  Should I use professional firms even with AI tools?
Yes. AI enhances scope, but human expertise and legal context remain crucial for comprehensive coverage.

Traditional agent-based simulations, however, often fall short, relying on rigid, handcrafted rules that can't capture the complexities of human intentions and adaptive behaviors.CitySim emerges as a groundbreaking framework, integrating large language models (LLMs) to simulate realistic, adaptive urban behavior on an unprecedented scale.CitySim leverages advances in large language models (like GPT-4o) to create agents that act and interact realistically within a virtual urban environment. These agents are equipped with:: Each agent has demographic attributes, personality traits, and preferences derived from real-world surveys.Recursive Value-Driven Planning: Agents dynamically generate daily schedules considering mandatory tasks, personal habits, situational factors, and intrinsic desires.Long-Term Goals and Memory: Agents maintain evolving beliefs, long-term aspirations, and memories that affect their decisions and interactions over time.
  
  
  Cognitive State Representation
CitySim agents are initialized with detailed personas derived from survey data, including demographic attributes (age, occupation, education), personality traits (Big Five), and habitual behaviors (e.g., meal timings, leisure activities).: Chronological records of daily events.: Agents synthesize daily events into higher-level insights.: Beliefs about visited locations, updated through direct observations and similarity-based inference.Upon visiting a location, agents form subjective appraisals based on their persona and context, continuously refining their beliefs about different city locations.Agents make sophisticated decisions regarding their daily movements:: Filling schedules starting from mandatory activities, down to leisure activities based on their intrinsic values.: A belief-weighted gravity model guides location choices, balancing personal preferences and proximity.: Transportation mode is chosen by evaluating factors like distance, time, weather, and individual preferences.CitySim agents form dynamic social relationships, maintaining evolving beliefs about affinity, trust, and familiarity with others, leading to realistic face-to-face and online interactions.CitySim significantly outperforms traditional and other LLM-based simulation frameworks in multiple dimensions:Agents' daily schedules closely match real-world survey data, demonstrating realistic macro-level patterns of human activities.CitySim agents were consistently rated as more human-like than agents from other leading frameworks, thanks to adaptive, context-sensitive behaviors.Simulated travel data from CitySim closely aligns with real-world patterns, accurately reflecting peaks and troughs in urban mobility.CitySim effectively models pedestrian crowd density, closely matching real-world data in major urban areas.Despite its strengths, CitySim inherits potential biases from underlying LLMs and may occasionally produce inaccuracies. Ethical considerations include the risk of amplifying biases or influencing real-world urban policies without adequate human oversight.CitySim represents a significant advancement towards realistic city-scale simulation, enabling nuanced insights into human urban behaviors, beneficial for research, urban planning, and policy-making.CitySim sets a new standard in agent-based modeling, moving beyond rigid rules and embracing the adaptability and complexity of human behaviors.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Silent Revolution — How AI Developers Are Transforming UK Healthcare</title><link>https://dev.to/sara_wilson_fdbb79bdfb2c2/the-silent-revolution-how-ai-developers-are-transforming-uk-healthcare-1k34</link><author>Sara Wilson</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 3 Jul 2025 00:53:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Modern healthcare in the UK is at a crossroads. On one side, there’s rising demand, aging infrastructure, and workforce shortages. On the other, there’s the promise of data-driven solutions that can predict illness, streamline operations, and personalise treatment. But none of this promise becomes reality without one key player — the artificial intelligence developer.While AI in medicine often gets attention for flashy ideas like robot surgeons, the more impactful story is happening quietly behind the scenes — in NHS trusts, healthtech startups, and research labs across the UK. It’s a story of algorithms solving real human problems, and developers making it happen.AI Isn’t Replacing Doctors — It’s Helping Them
Let’s be clear from the start: AI in healthcare isn’t about replacing doctors. It’s about supporting them.In a typical NHS hospital, clinicians are drowning in paperwork, data, and demand. An AI model that can sift through patient history, flag anomalies, or automate administrative tasks can be the difference between burnout and better care.But building those systems — ones that are safe, ethical, and effective — isn’t easy. It requires developers with both technical skill and domain sensitivity. That’s where a skilled artificial intelligence developer steps in.They’re not just coding models — they’re collaborating with healthcare professionals to understand real-world workflows, risks, and bottlenecks. And when done right, the results are extraordinary.Real-World AI Use Cases in the UK Health SectorPredictive Diagnostics
A Cambridge-based startup is working with NHS trusts to develop models that predict sepsis risk hours before symptoms become critical. The AI developer on the project trained a model on thousands of anonymised patient records, using real-time vitals and lab results to trigger early alerts.Medical Imaging
In London, radiology departments are overwhelmed. AI developers are creating computer vision models to pre-screen X-rays and flag anomalies — massively improving triage times without sacrificing accuracy.Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Many health systems still rely on handwritten notes or dictated summaries. Developers are building NLP tools to extract structured insights from unstructured clinical text — helping GPs access past notes, medications, and family history more efficiently.Chatbots for Patient Engagement
AI-powered bots are now being used by local practices to handle appointment booking, follow-ups, and prescription refills — reducing call centre load and giving staff more time for urgent care.Ethics, Privacy, and the UK’s Data Advantage
The UK is uniquely positioned for AI healthcare innovation. Thanks to the NHS, there’s a massive, centralised health dataset — something no other country has at scale. But with that opportunity comes huge responsibility.An AI developer working in this space must consider:GDPR Compliance: Data usage must be fully transparent and anonymised.Bias Mitigation: Models must perform equally well across diverse populations.Explainability: Clinicians need to understand why a model makes a decision — not just what it says.That’s why local expertise matters. AI developers working with UK health data must understand both the ethical standards and the regulatory landscape. Agencies like MagicFactory specialise in providing exactly that kind of talent — UK-ready, healthcare-savvy professionals who can deliver precision without compromise.A Quick Note on Trust
Trust is everything in medicine. One bad prediction, one security flaw, one confusing interface — and the system risks being shelved.The role of a developer here is not just to build tech that works. It’s to build tech that earns trust. That means working closely with clinicians, patients, and compliance officers. It means iterating, auditing, and documenting every step.This is what sets apart great AI developers in healthcare — they don’t build black boxes. They build tools that integrate cleanly into workflows and explain themselves clearly.AI Can Fix the Small Things Too
Not every breakthrough involves diagnostics. Sometimes, it’s about making mundane tasks smoother.Reducing admin errors by automating form entry.Analysing patient feedback to improve service design.Matching available appointment slots to patient profiles using AI-driven scheduling.These may not grab headlines — but they save time, improve morale, and elevate patient satisfaction.That’s the kind of practical thinking an artificial intelligence developer brings — grounded, not grandiose.NHS Partnerships and the Rise of Healthtech
More NHS trusts are now opening doors to tech partnerships. From pilot programmes to full-scale adoption, AI projects are being tested and refined across the UK.Startups like Babylon Health, Ada, and Skin Analytics all work with developers to power their offerings — many of which are now used by NHS patients. And as these projects grow, so too does the demand for AI specialists who understand medical data, UK health policy, and rapid deployment cycles.That’s where outsourcing development — especially to specialised partners — has become a game-changer. Hiring full-time AI talent is tough. But working with a trusted external team can get a working MVP into NHS hands in months, not years.Final Thoughts: Precision with Purpose
In the end, AI in healthcare isn’t about flashy technology — it’s about better outcomes. Fewer errors. Earlier interventions. More time for what matters.That doesn’t happen without thoughtful design. It doesn’t happen without deep collaboration. And it certainly doesn’t happen without the right artificial intelligence developer guiding the way.As the UK’s healthcare system modernises, the developers behind these systems won’t just shape technology — they’ll help shape lives.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I Built My Own Offline ChatGPT Stack Because the Internet is Temporary and Cats Are Agents of Chaos</title><link>https://dev.to/ghotet/i-built-my-own-offline-chatgpt-stack-because-the-internet-is-temporary-and-cats-are-agents-of-chaos-23hk</link><author>Jay</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 3 Jul 2025 00:34:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey there, fellow terminal gremlins 👋
I'm Jay—aka Ghotet, chaos-friendly solo dev, digital necromancer, and long-time tinkerer of systems no one asked for. Today I’m sharing how I stitched together a fully offline, self-hosted ChatGPT clone using open source parts, some bash glue, and a healthy disrespect for cloud dependency.TL;DR: I wanted an AI assistant that works without internet, plays nice with local tools like Stable Diffusion and SearXNG, and lives on my own domain. Also, my cats keep breaking it.🧠 The Stack: Built from Curiosity and a Bit of Spite
🔍 Core LLM — LM Studio (running Mythalion 13B)
I’m using LM Studio as the language engine, running locally via GGUF models. Right now it’s dialed to Mythalion 13B for its mix of smarts and creative leanings. The whole thing runs headless from a custom launcher script. No API keys, no cloud, no telemetry.🎨 Visuals — A1111 (Stable Diffusion)
For visual generation and character concepting (yes, including bikini armor if I want it), I wired in Automatic1111, running fully offline. API access is enabled so prompts can be piped in directly from the chat interface.🌐 Web Search — SearXNG (Self-hosted)
To enable research and general brain-extension, I slotted in SearXNG. It runs locally, routes search queries anonymously, and feeds results into the stack when needed. Originally tried Docker, but now it's running through my venv setup for tighter control and portability.🕸️ Web Frontend — Terminal-style Interface @ ghotet.com
Everything is wrapped in a custom retro terminal UI hosted at ghotet.com. Think early-2000s cyberpunk console vibes. Currently private—no guest login just yet—but it's functional and fast.💡 Why I Did This
Because I like my tools local, moddable, and entirely mine. I wanted:A personal chatbot that actually lives on my machineVisual generation without round-tripping to some cloud GPU farmWeb search that doesn’t log me into a panopticonA unified front-end I can bend to my willAlso, let’s be real: I’m a sucker for a terminal that feels alive.⚙️ What’s Working
✅ LM Studio launches cleanly and routes input/output
✅ A1111 runs with API access and feeds visuals into the flow
✅ SearXNG is now portable and integrated into the chat stack
✅ The full interface is browser-accessible via my domain
✅ Modularity is in place: every part can be swapped or upgraded📱 What’s Next
🔧 Remote Access
I’m working on a remote control bridge, so when I forget to shut down the stack before leaving, I can log in from my phone and reset it. This has become necessary because my cats have discovered keyboard inputs and enjoy triggering hotkeys that collapse my entire setup.🔊 TTS (Maybe)
I’ve been testing offline text-to-speech tools, but most open options either lag too much or sound like a haunted Speak & Spell. If I find one fast enough for real-time chat, I’ll wire it in.🧩 Bonus Project — ARG Terminal @ ghotet.dev
I’m also migrating my alternate reality hacker terminal to ghotet.dev. It’s part portfolio, part digital rabbit hole. Expect binary rain, cryptic prompts, and a few unsettling vibes. Less functional, more for fun. I haven't fully set-up the new domain yet so it is likely not up at the time of writing.🗣️ What About You?
I’d love to hear from other tinkerers—if you’ve built your own local AI stack, hacked together a weird interface, or just like the idea of owning your tools, drop a comment.Here’s a few sparks to get the thread moving:What’s your dream self-hosted AI setup look like?Got any cool tools or models I should try out?Is there a non-creepy TTS stack that doesn't sound like it escaped from a dial-up modem? Asking for a friend.Am I the only one whose pets keep triggering system-wide mayhem, or is that just part of the dev life now?Let’s chat. I’m around. And if your comment is interesting enough, maybe I’ll wire your idea into the next update 😏If you have any questions about me, feel free to ask or follow me on dev.to or github.com @ghotet.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🚀 How to Get Google VEO3 Student Premium Free in 2025 — Step by Step Guide</title><link>https://dev.to/adonis_school_f714593677c/how-to-get-google-veo3-student-premium-free-in-2025-step-by-step-guide-4g9k</link><author>Adonis School</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 3 Jul 2025 00:10:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google’s VEO3 Student Premium plan offers incredible benefits like 1TB storage and premium tools.

  Is AI the therapist of the future—or a threat?
Can you spill your heart out to an app and actually feel heard? Wild thought, right? But get this—millions already are. In fact, downloads of mental health and therapy apps powered by AI have surged by over  in the past few years. That’s a lot of quiet confessions being made to something that doesn’t blink, breathe, or bench-press emotions. So… does AI have the chops to help us heal? Or are we outsourcing our mental health to machines that don’t quite “get” the human part?I don’t know about you, but the idea of talking to a robot about my deepest fears kinda makes me want to back slowly out of the room. But also—there’s a little part of me that  the appeal. Round-the-clock access, zero judgment, no scheduling struggles, and it won’t roll its eyes when you say you’re still hung up on your ex from 2014.We’re living in an age where  tools are quickly becoming a lifeline, especially for people who might not have access to traditional therapy because of cost, location, time—or even stigma. Apps like Woebot and Wysa use AI-driven chatbots to mimic CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) practices. And folks are raving, saying it helps them feel , even if it’s through lines of code.Well, it’s not all rainbows and robot hugs. AI still doesn’t understand context the way humans do. It might offer textbook advice without grasping the depth of your personal pain. And let’s talk privacy—because unloading your soul into an app feels shaky when you’re not sure how your data is being used.But don’t worry, we’re not here to fear-monger. This isn’t a “run for the hills” moment. Instead, let’s figure out how to  this technology without losing our humanity.
  
  
  Here are three ways to embrace AI therapy Do a background check (yes, even on bots). Research any mental health app before you download it. Look for expert reviews, transparency about AI use, and clear data privacy policies. If an app can’t explain how it’s keeping your emotional details safe, it’s a red flag.Use AI for support—not a diagnosis. AI can help you reflect or work on coping strategies, but it’s no substitute for a licensed therapist’s experience and human intuition. Think of it like mental health “first aid,” not brain surgery. If therapy is accessible to you, try blending traditional sessions with AI-based journaling or check-ins. It can help track patterns and support your progress between appointments.Here’s the thing: I tried one of these AI therapy tools myself during a bout of late-night anxiety (you know, that special 2 a.m. brand of overthinking), and it actually helped me breathe easier. Not because it was flawless—but because it gave me a moment to pause, reflect, and feel just a little less alone.The truth?  isn’t about replacing therapists. It’s about expanding the toolkit. And if we stay open-eyed and cautious, it could fill some serious gaps in mental wellness care.So, stick around—because we’re about to dig deeper into the exciting, weird, and sometimes worrying world of AI therapy. This isn’t the future of mental health—it’s already here. Time to decide how we want to use it.
  How AI Is Making Therapy More AccessibleDid you know that nearly 60% of people with mental health issues never receive treatment? Yep—more than half. And it’s not because they’re unwilling. It’s because therapy can be  expensive, waitlists are long, and for some, it still feels taboo just to ask for help.Sound familiar? Maybe you've thought about trying therapy but felt overwhelmed even figuring out where to start. Or you've sat on a waitlist for months just to get one appointment. You're totally not alone—and honestly, this is something we need to talk about more.
  
  
  The Problem: It’s Not Just in Your Head (Unfortunately)
Accessing mental health care is a luxury for too many. Between high session costs (think $100–$250 per hour!), location issues (what if there’s no therapist nearby?), or cultural stigma ("therapy is not for us"), help often feels light-years away.And let’s be real—mental health doesn’t care if it's 3 a.m. on a Thursday. When anxiety hits or your mood dips, help needs to be , not three sessions from now.
  
  
  The Cool Shift: Enter AI, Stage Left
This is where things get interesting. AI isn’t just about self-driving cars or creepy tech overlords—it’s actually sliding quietly into mental health, offering support in ways that are  practical and shockingly effective.Take , for example. It’s a friendly chatbot based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques. It checks in, walks you through your feelings, challenges those sneaky distorted thoughts, and even cracks the occasional joke (which, okay, aren’t always hilarious—but the heart’s there).Then there’s , an AI-powered emotional health assistant that uses psychological techniques to help you track moods, understand emotional patterns, and work through tension  it boils over. One of my friends started using it during a rough patch when therapy wasn’t financially doable. She said it felt like having a wise little pocket-friend.
  
  
  Real Impact: Underserved Communities Get a Lifeline
One of the most powerful things about AI tools? They're democratizing mental health. Rural areas with limited providers? International users where therapy is scarce or stigmatized? Teens who don’t want to talk to adults yet? These tools meet people —no insurance, no appointment, no raised eyebrows.: No more waiting for Monday morning. AI tools are always “on.”: Many apps offer free versions or low subscription fees—cheaper than a coffee a week.: You can engage from your couch, journal in your pajamas, and still get support.
  
  
  But Wait... Is It Enough?
Let’s be honest—AI isn’t a full replacement for a licensed therapist, especially for deep trauma or complex conditions. But it’s a powerful . It’s like the friend who picks up the phone at 2 a.m. when your brain won’t quit spinning. Not the whole cure, but a soft place to land while you figure out the next thing.
  
  
  Closing Thought: More Doors, Fewer Barriers
The bottom line? AI isn’t perfect—but in a world where mental health help can feel out of reach, it’s . And that’s something to be hopeful about. If you—or someone you know—is struggling to access care, exploring these tools might be the gentle nudge forward you’ve been waiting for.Because everyone deserves support. No gatekeeping. Just help when you need it, how you need it. That’s what accessibility is all about.
  When Algorithms Listen: Are You Being Heard?Did you know that some people feel  opening up to AI about their deepest fears than to an actual therapist? Wild, right? But it's true. In one survey,  said they prefer confiding in AI over humans—because it doesn't judge, interrupt, or raise an eyebrow.Now, if you're anything like me, your first reaction might be: “Wait… really? Talking to a robot feels that good?” I mean, part of what makes therapy so healing is that human moment—the subtle nod, that gentle “mm-hmm,” the warm eye contact that says, “I see you.”But AI doesn’t blink. It doesn’t lean in. And it definitely doesn’t have Sunday-afternoon bad-hair days like the rest of us. So how does it “listen,” really? And can it make us feel truly understood?
  
  
  The Emotional Short Circuit of AI
Let’s be real: empathy is messy. It’s not just about saying the right thing—it’s about  the right thing. And that’s exactly where AI hits a wall.Most AI tools, like mental wellness chatbots or symptom trackers, use advanced language models to recognize emotional cues—like when you say, “I can’t do this anymore,” it knows you’re not just talking about your to-do list. They can respond with reassuring messages, sometimes shockingly well. That’s thanks to machine learning, which mimics empathy... kinda.But here’s the tricky part: AI doesn’t actually “feel.” It doesn’t get that gut-punch when you talk about heartbreak. It doesn’t connect your pauses or tears to a childhood memory. And it sure as heck doesn’t spot the sarcasm in “oh, I’m .”So while some users feel seen by the non-judgmental, always-available nature of AI (bless that 24/7 access), others walk away feeling… flat. Like there’s a missing piece. Because sometimes, we don’t want someone to solve our pain. We just want someone to sit in it with us.
  
  
  So What Can We Do About It?
If you’re thinking of using AI for mental wellness—whether it’s journaling with an app, chatting with a bot, or getting cognitive behavioral prompts—here’s how to make the most of it without losing the human touch:Use AI as a warm-up, not a replacement. Let it help you organize your thoughts before you talk to a therapist or friend. It can be like drafting an emotional rough outline.Beware the illusion of “being heard.” If you leave the chat still feeling alone, that’s a red flag. Real understanding often comes from nuance—and humans still do nuance better.Combine AI with real relationships. Use insights from AI (like mood tracking or journaling prompts) to spark deeper convos with the people who love and support you.
  
  
  Human + Tech = the Real Healing Combo
I had a friend, Maya, who started using an AI journaling app during a rough patch. It helped her vent without worrying about someone’s reaction—which she found oddly freeing. But after a while, she told me, “It was like shouting into a void and hearing my own voice echo back. Useful, but lonely.”And that’s the thing. AI can be a helpful tool—like a flashlight in a dark tunnel. It points the way. But sometimes, you need a person to walk beside you. We don’t have to choose. We can use technology to enhance real human support, not replace it. And as this field grows, there’s real potential for AI to become better at reading us—but it’ll always need us to give it heart.So let the bots listen—but don’t forget to let the humans in.
  The Privacy Puzzle: Who Owns Your Mental Health Data?Did you know that over 80% of mental health apps share user data with third parties—often without making it crystal clear?Yeah, I had to reread that too.Here’s the thing: when you're pouring your heart out to a chatbot at 2 a.m. or filling out a mood tracker after a rough day, it feels like a private moment, right? Just you and the app. But behind the scenes, your most personal thoughts—your fears, triggers, therapy notes—might be stored, analyzed, and even shared in ways you’d never expect. Kinda unsettling, isn’t it?
  
  
  The Problem: Oversharing Without Knowing It
I once signed up for a “mental wellness” app that promised personalized support through AI. It asked me things like, “How often have you felt worthless in the past week?” and “Do you experience anxiety before social events?” I answered honestly. Why not? It was all in the name of self-care, right?What I didn’t realize was that buried in the app’s privacy policy were loopholes big enough to drive a bus through. They claimed my data was “anonymized,” but also admitted it could be used for “research and product development”—which sounds nice, until you realize that might mean sharing your emotional patterns with a marketing company somewhere.
  
  
  What's Really Happening With Your Data?
Here’s what's scary: many mental health apps and AI tools operate in a gray zone. Because they’re not always regulated like traditional healthcare providers, they don’t have to follow HIPAA or stricter global regulations. That means there's often:: You give the app access, but who really controls that rich info afterward?Loose anonymization practices: Your name may be stripped, but your individual behavioral patterns can still be traceable in the right (or wrong) hands.: Many apps tuck data-sharing permissions into long, dense terms nobody reads.
  
  
  How to Protect Yourself (Without Giving Up Tech Support)
Okay, we’re not saying ditch the AI-powered journaling or support bots totally. They're incredibly helpful. But let’s stay smart. Here’s how you can keep using tools like these—safely:Read the privacy policy (yes, really): If it's written like a legal riddle, that's a red flag. Look for clear terms about what data is stored and how it's used.Stick with reputable, transparent apps: Look for ones backed by mental health professionals or academic institutions. Hint: if they brag about their compliance with data regulations, that’s usually a good sign.Avoid oversharing personal identifiers: If the app doesn’t require your real name or location, don’t offer it. Keep identifiable info to a minimum when possible.As awareness grows, so does responsibility. Some mental health tech companies are stepping up—using encrypted storage, only collecting what’s necessary, and asking for genuine informed consent. That’s progress. And as users (that’s us!), asking questions and protecting our data pushes the whole industry to do better.So next time an app asks for your emotional download, pause for a second. Ask yourself: “Would I be okay with someone else reading this?” If not, maybe that detail doesn’t need to go in.Your mental health is sacred. Let’s treat it that way—even in the digital world.
  Are We Replacing Human Therapists Too Soon?Did you know that one in five people say they’d rather talk to an AI about their mental health than a human therapist? Wild, right? It sounds convenient—private, instant, and judgment-free. But that stat stopped me in my tracks. Are we really that eager to hand over our deepest feelings to a chatbot?Let’s break this down together, friend to friend. Because if you’ve ever struggled to find the  therapist, you know how hard it is. Waitlists stretch for months. Sessions are expensive. And sometimes you're just... not vibing with the person across the couch. So when a friendly AI pops up with 24/7 access and zero waiting room awkwardness, yeah—it’s tempting.But here’s the thing: therapists don’t just listen. They . They track subtle cues, emotions, even the pauses in your voice. They pick up on trauma responses you didn’t even know were happening. A chatbot? It’s reading text and maybe voice inputs. It can simulate empathy with programmed responses, but it doesn’t actually feel or interpret in the human way.The biggest danger in leaning too hard on AI for therapy is thinking it’s a full replacement. It’s kind of like using a GPS: great for directions, but you still need to watch the road. AI can give helpful scripts and reflect basic CBT ideas, sure, but it won't dive deeply into complex emotional landscapes—and that’s where people really need the human touch.Imagine someone dealing with PTSD or suicidal thoughts getting generic reassurance from a chatbot. That gives me chills. Some mental health apps have already been caught responding  to serious personal disclosures. It’s not that AI is bad—it just hasn’t matured emotionally (and honestly, probably never will).Think of AI as support, not a substitute. Use AI tools for journaling, reminders, or guided exercises—but don’t treat them like licensed professionals.Push for “blended” care models. Tech + therapist = better, not fewer, sessions. Some clinics already use AI to monitor mood over time, so your real-life therapist gets richer insights.Stay informed about app credentials. Make sure any mental health app or bot you use cites real psychologists in the design process, not just data engineers.Personally, I use a mental wellness app to track my mood and energy. It gives me daily summaries—kind of like a digital diary. Super useful. But when I hit a rough patch last year, I still booked weekly calls with my therapist. Because I needed that true human empathy, reflection, and guidance. And it made a world of difference.AI isn’t the end of therapy—it could be the evolution. Imagine AI tools helping busy therapists stay connected with clients between sessions. Or spotting shifts in mood patterns before a crisis. That’s exciting stuff. We just have to remember: healing is human work. And no algorithm can replace what happens when someone .So yeah, tech can totally help—but let’s not confuse “helpful” with “healer.” Your mental health deserves the real thing. And you’re not alone in needing it.
  AI and Mental Health: Balance Is the Real SuperpowerDid you know that over 75% of people with mental health conditions in low- and middle-income countries receive  treatment at all? That stat totally blew my mind. It’s heartbreaking—yet it makes the case for why AI tools in mental health are gaining so much attention. We want to close the gap, reach more people, and offer quicker, easier support. But here’s the million-dollar question: can a chatbot really understand your bad day the same way a human therapist can?If you’ve ever opened a mental health app in a moment of anxiety hoping for calm—and instead got a series of robotic suggestions like “try meditating” or “breathe deeply”—you probably know what I mean. Helpful? Meh. Personal? Not quite. The truth is, artificial intelligence can do a lot. It can scan patterns in your sleep, track mood swings, offer 24/7 check-ins. But when it comes to empathy, intuition, and warm human presence? That’s where machines still fall short.
  
  
  So what’s the smart way forward?
Instead of treating this like an either-or situation—human vs. AI—we can reframe it. Let’s think . It’s not about picking sides. It’s about building a team: technology + humanness.Use AI for what it's best at: Think scheduling therapy sessions, getting mental health reminders, or keeping mood journals. These small tools can lighten your mental load when your mind already feels heavy. Whether it’s a licensed therapist, a crisis counselor, or a trusted friend—real people offer real understanding. No app can match that feeling of “I see you, I get it.”Stay curious, not passive: Ask questions about the tech you use. Where’s your data going? Who trained the AI? Is it supporting diverse needs? Your mental wellbeing is precious—don’t hand it over blindly.I once tried an AI mental health app during a particularly nasty bout of anxiety. While it didn’t “heal” me, it did prompt me to notice a triggering pattern I hadn’t fully caught before.  insight helped me bring it up in my next therapy session—where the real processing happened. So in my experience? Tech opened the door, but a human walked me through it.You don’t have to choose a side—you deserve . Let AI handle the data, the trends, the nudges. But let humans hold your heart. Let them listen between the lines, offer the gentle laugh or tearful connection you can’t script into code.So let’s move forward with our eyes open and values intact. Stay informed. Stay empowered. Use AI as a support tool—but never a substitute for real connection. Because in the grand adventure of healing? Balance is the real superpower. 🧠💛]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🎁 Get Google VEO3 Student Premium for Free (2025 No Verification Trick)</title><link>https://dev.to/adonis_hamza_8479620f7887/get-google-veo3-student-premium-for-free-2025-no-verification-trick-44h6</link><author>Adonis Hamza</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 23:57:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[🎁 Get Google VEO3 Student Premium for Free (2025 No Verification Trick)

I was searching for a tool that could help me bring my ideas to life without the usual months of backend struggle, boilerplate code, and sleepless nights chasing bugs. What I found instead was a platform that redefined the way I build.I’m just a solo builder with big ideas, turning passion projects into real-world solutions, and also an entrepreneur, and dreamer. I don’t have a full team behind me or a corporate budget. What I do have is a passion for solving real-world problems using technology, and Bolt.new gave me the power to do that faster and better than ever before.The Birth of Synclinic
My flagship project built with Bolt is called Synclinic, a virtual AI-powered health platform designed to connect doctors and patients online, especially in regions where healthcare access is limited or inconsistent. It is inspired by a real challenges faced in the Caribbean on my latest trips.AI-powered medical support (via OpenAI + ElevenLabs)Real-time communication between doctors and patientsSecure health records and prescriptionsA growing health community where users can share experiencesI built everything on Bolt in a record time. What would’ve taken weeks of setup elsewhere took minutes with Bolt's intuitive interface.The project was constructed using:React + Supabase for frontend and real-time dataEdge Functions for handling privacy-sensitive actions (Supabase Edge)OpenAI to power the AI assistant “Agatha Christine”ElevenLabs API for voice interactions with patientsStripe for payment handling and wallet top-upsTailwind CSS + Framer Motion** for UI and animationsEverything was stitched together on Bolt.new, where scaffolding, deployment, environment configuration, and secrets management were handled in a few intuitive steps.How Bolt.new Changed My Process ForeverStruggle with deployment pipelinesFigure out cloud hosting pricingspend hours linking backend to frontendFight with environment variables and DockerBut Now With Bolt, I just… created.Every new project starts with a prompt, and in under 30 seconds, I had a working environment. Starting something new had never felt so effortless, Whether I needed a full-stack boilerplate, a ready-to-run AI chatbot, or a real-time chat app, Bolt had a template or AI suggestion to start me off.AI-Assisted Development = Next-Level SpeedOne of my favorite features of Bolt is its AI pair programming, Whether I was stuck writing complex logic or just looking to build a new feature, I used AI inside the editor to:Autocomplete backend API routesWrite Supabase queries with proper RLS policiesGenerate edge function handlersStyle components with TailwindBolt.new was not just a tool, it was a mentor. It gave me suggestions, pointed out bugs, and even taught me things I didn’t know. I truly felt like I was building alongside an expert.Tacking Sponsor ChallengesOne major part of the Bolt hackathon was the Supabase challenge, and I went all in, I created over 50 well-structured tables across patient and doctor roles, each protected with Row Level Security (RLS), with:Edge functions for file uploadsCustom policies for AI interaction logsReal-time sync between users and doctorsI even integrated Supabase storage for handling lab reports and patient photos. Every file uploaded is safe, queryable, and downloadable, secured by signed URLs and stored in individual user buckets.Here's a Code Snippet I Loved Writingts
// Edge function to store patient medical summary
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('medical_records')
    patient_id: user.id,
    summary: request.body.summary,
    doctor_id: request.body.doctorId,if (error) {
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: error.message }), { status: 500 });
`This simple yet powerful snippet allowed me to save data securely, with proper authentication and access management.If I had to summarize what Bolt.new gave me in one word, it would be: Confidence.Confidence to build fasterConfidence to scale smartConfidence to integrate AI tools into my appsConfidence that I could ship in days, not monthsThis experience was not just about launching a project. It was about growing as a builder. It taught me to combine my coding skills with no-code logic, use AI as a real partner, and rely on next-gen platforms to take care of the infrastructure.*
I didn’t stop at one. Using Bolt, I also built:All these projects share the same foundation: built with Bolt.new in record time.If you're a solo dev, or someone with an idea who could change the world, Bolt.new is your best friend.You're not just coding; you're launching visions, creating jobs, solving real-world issues.This wasn’t just a hackathon.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Vibe Coding in The World&apos;s Largest Hackathon: Building GPXTrack.xyz</title><link>https://dev.to/mkasberg/vibe-coding-in-the-worlds-largest-hackathon-building-gpxtrackxyz-2g05</link><author>Mike Kasberg</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 22:25:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I got pretty excited when Bolt.new announced the World's Largest Hackathon. I saw not only an opportunity to build something cool, but also -- and perhaps more importantly -- an opportunity to gain experience building something with AI tools. A hackathon's the perfect place to explore the capabilities of AI tools because it let me lean in to vibe coding experience. I used the AI for many more kinds of tasks that I normally would, and I let it take control of things much more than I normally would. As a result, I think I was able to discover and push the limits of AI in my own workflow much faster than I otherwise would have, so it was an excellent learning experience!Bolt.new is StackBlitz's new AI-first coding platform that lets you use AI chat and codegen to build web applications without leaving the browser. And while I'm not completely sold on the in-browser IDE, it's actually grown on me a little over the course of the hackathon. I was happy to give the platform a try since Bolt.new was offering 10M tokens to anyone who wanted to participate in the World's Largest Hackathon. Fundamentally, the tool is just an agent that's using Claude to generate and edit code, so I think many of the approaches and techniques I've picked up are equally applicable to Bolt.new and to other agents, like Claude Code.

Several months ago, Wes Bos was getting into 3D printing and sharing his journey on X. I've been interested in 3D printing for a while, so I was eager to follow along. As Wes got deeper into 3D printing, he was searching for ways to integrate programming with 3D printing and found ManifoldCAD, a tool to programmatically generate 3D models using javascript. I think Wes was attracted to ManifoldCAD for many of the same reasons that I like OpenSCAD. I've been pretty happy using OpenSCAD for a long time, but I was a little surprised at all the things Wes was able to do when I saw Bracket.Engineer for the first time!  Wes took ManifoldCAD to the next level by using it as a library, in combination with Three.js, to deploy a website that lets you customize a parametric model in your web browser as a GUI, with the complete capabilities of javascript.  I thought this was awesome, and the ability to easily integrate code from another language was a capability that I'd been missing in OpenSCAD!More than a year ago, I worked on a project to generate a 3D printable model from a GPX track using OpenSCAD. Because I needed a more powerful programming language than OpenSCAD itself to import data from a GPX file, I wrote some code in Ruby that would parse the GPX file and render OpenSCAD code using a template.
The approach worked, and is still available at github.com/mkasberg/3d-gpx-figurines, but it was an ugly approach and I wished there was a cleaner way to do it. I realized when I saw Bracket.Engineer that the tight integration Wes had achieved between JS code and a ManifoldCAD model would provide a much cleaner way to generate a 3D model from a GPX activity track, and the World's Largest Hackathon seemed like the perfect place to experiment with the approach. It was a perfect combination of events!
  
  
  The AI Prompt Learning Curve
Without initially knowing what Bolt.new was capable of, or even what kind of prompts worked best, I took a naive approach and dove right in. I forked the Bracket.Engineer repo to use as a starting point, and started thinking about all the work to be done. First and foremost, I needed to get my OpenSCAD GPX path model to work in the ManifoldCAD library, or this whole project would hit a dead-end very quickly! I tried to just zero-shot it, with relatively little context, by pasting the entire OpenSCAD file into the prompt and adding a sentence or two asking Bolt to port the code to ManifoldCAD. And when that was done, I wrote another short prompt asking it to update the code to reference my new GPX model instead of the bracket model from the original repo. To my surprise and delight, it did a reasonably good job! It didn't work perfectly on the first attempt, but it got close enough that I knew this was going to be possible!Although my first prompt went surprisingly well, I quickly got a taste of the many ways AI can fail as I worked with the AI in frustration to make half a dozen different flavors of "fix it" commits. Most of them only partially worked, and some didn't work at all. There were a few fundamental problems with the ported 3D model (rendering in broken ways) that the AI seemed unable to fix, so I had to dig into myself and do some real (human) debugging work. I soon realized that the AI had repeatedly made the same error with order of operations as it was porting code from OpenSCAD to JS. OpenSCAD is a functional-inspired language, and commonly uses code like . The LLM had ported many of these operations to JS like cube.translate().rotate(), which is . (Order of operations is important when you're translating things and rotating them about the origin.) I ended up fixing several of these errors manually, which was actually reasonably quick once I recognized the failure pattern.I ended my first day of "vibe coding" optimistic about the possibilities, but also frustrated about the reality that the AI had written lots of bugs and left other tasks incomplete, and the process to fix the bugs and get things working was incredibly slow so far. Before starting the next day, I had time to think about the approach I'd taken on the first day, what had worked, and what had not. I noticed that Bolt was actually creating a new git commit every time I asked it to change something (which led to a lot of "fix something" commits). I also explored the Bolt UI more deeply and noticed that it supported working on different branches. For my second day of vibe coding, I decided to try doing all my work on a branch and opening a pull request with the changes, which would give me a better way to review code  it hit my main branch.
  
  
  AI Troubleshooting Techniques
OpenSCAD supports 3D text, and ManifoldCAD does not, but I knew that 3D text was an important part of my project and I wanted to find a way to implement it. I started a new branch in Bolt. I had no idea how we were going to make this work, so I started asking the LLM questions. I think this was my first use of the "Discussion" mode in Bolt. I asked it if there were any common techniques for using 3D text in ManifoldCAD. (There weren't, as ManifoldCAD doesn't have that feature.) So I asked it, at a higher level, what the most common approach was to create 3D text. It outlined a process at a high level that exports contours from a 2D font and extrudes those contours into a 3D model. Then I asked it to make a plan that would allow us to use extruded font contours in our own project. It made a fairly detailed plan to use opentype.js to extract contours from a web font, send the contours to our model in the right format, and extrude them as 3D text. It was working well above my knowledge of fonts, contours, and 3D rendering here. I could have maybe figured all this out on my own, but it would have been  of reading arcane things about how fonts work. I learned a lot quickly just by watching the LLM think, and I asked it to implement the plan.It wrote a lot of code, and it seemed mostly correct to me at first glance. There were a couple errors, and the AI was able to work through them and fix them. But then the errors were gone, and we were stuck. Lots of code that I didn't really understand, and no errors, but no 3D text. I was stumped, and I took a break to think. I didn't want to debug all this font code myself, but the AI was unable to make progress. Asking it to fix the problem, without a clear indication of what was wrong and no error message, made it start hallucinating issues and breaking things further as it tried to fix the wrong thing. What would  do, if I were the AI in this situation?  Back to basics. Print statement debugging. And that's exactly what I asked the AI to do. I told it that we have a problem because there are no errors, but the text isn't showing up, and we need to use  to validate our assumptions.I was blown away by the results. It added  log messages in more than a dozen different places throughout the complicated code it had just written, and logged exactly the right thing in a nice readable form at every location. It probably would have taken me an hour to do that myself, and the logs wouldn't look as nice. This was great! I started up the app, got dozens of lines of logs, and was just starting to get sad about reading through them all when it occurred to me to just try pasting all the log output back to the LLM. So I did. I pasted more than 50 lines of the logs it had just written itself and I asked it to interpret the results. And I was blown away again. It drew correct conclusions from all of it's log messages, showed its reasoning in bullet form, and stated quite confidently that we had correct contours all the way through our pipeline but weren't getting 3D shapes and it was probably because our "winding order" was backwards. Okay, I told it to fix the winding order. It added a .reverse() in the right spot, and I had mostly-working 3D text in ManifoldCAD! I was ecstatic! All this work had been done on a branch, so I asked it to remove the logs it had added and clean up the code for a PR. I didn't closely review all of the new font-rendering code, but I knew it worked before I merged it because I had the opportunity to test it, and that was good enough for me!As I used the LLM more, I became much more confident with it. I was developing a sense of its abilities. I knew what it did well, and I knew what it would struggle with. I started crafting better prompts to guide it around the parts I knew would be tricky. My prompts grew more precise, and the generated code became more precise as a result. One trick I learned was that it  helped to discuss the plan before generating any code. With this technique, I could be a little lazy and provide a mediocre prompt with a sentence or two about what we needed to do, and the LLM would generate a short paragraph and several bullets about what needed to happen. If the plan was bad, I had a chance to revise it before we started going down the wrong path in code. And if the plan was good, the LLM always performed better edits using its own detailed plan than it did using my short and vague description. Using this technique, I got to the point where on several occasions the LLM generated a PR on the first try that I was able to merge with no edits! And it felt awesome, because I knew I was moving . When things went smoothly, I could generate, review, and merge a PR in minutes that would probably have taken an hour or more without AI help.The confidence I gained solving the font problem and the other techniques I'd acquired along the way made me ambitious enough to try tackling bigger problems. I had the LLM move our model generation to a web worker to improve the performance and got great results! If I weren't using an AI code assistant, I might not even try that refactoring -- I'd have needed to spend a lot of time learning new things and fixing problems that were difficult to debug, and it probably wouldn't seem worthwhile to me since the performance without this optimization wasn't unbearable. But with AI help, I felt like I'd be able to try something quickly to see if it would work, even using technologies I didn't have a lot of experience with. (I initially tried a different approach, and discarded it pretty quickly when it wasn't working well. AI enabled me to experiment very quickly, and pivot very quickly when it wasn't working.)I'm really happy with gpxtrack.xyz! (And if you're a runner, hiker, or cyclist, you should go check it out!) Not only did I learn a ton about building web applications with AI, but I built something really cool along the way. It's open source onGitHub, so you can check out the code if you're interested!At the end of this experience, what I think I'm most excited about is seeing AI lower the cost of trying things. Adam Wathan has already shared an example of a project he and his team were able to finish that they might not have even tried without AI
help. The future is exciting, but I think LLM technology is still so new that most engineers using it have no idea what it's capable of. I think the fastest way for us to get there is to build new things and try new things, and the World's Largest Hackathon was a great way to do that. Some of my most important takeaways are:Don't let the AI wander too much on its own. It'll start hallucinating things, duplicating functionality, and doing other things that are terrible for the long-term health of a codebase.To prevent that, review the generated code regularly -- either right when the AI generates it, or with a PR, or with some other process.Discuss problems and make a detailed plan before writing code. Let the AI write a detailed prompt for itself. The AI is better at writing prompts for itself than you are, and this gives you an opportunity to review the plan before it's done in code.AIs are great at troubleshooting if they have the tools and context they need. Let them add logs, like a human would.AIs shift costs around to make things like experimentation much cheaper (in terms of developer time) than they otherwise would have been.AI technology continues to evolve so rapidly that it can feel hard to keep up, but I'm excited to see what the future holds!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>8-yrs: For A Moment Like This!</title><link>https://dev.to/warnerbell/8-yrs-for-a-moment-like-this-4m59</link><author>Warner Bell</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 21:59:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I built HalfonLife to transform "I can't afford that" into "I got 5 on it." After 8 years of dreaming about solving America's affordability crisis, this hackathon finally gave me the forcing function to turn my vision into production reality. What started as a YouTube ad playing while I was talking with my wife turned into 18 days of brutal, beautiful chaos that produced a live revenue-generating marketplace where 110 million Americans can find expense-sharing partners.
  
  
  📺 How a YouTube Ad Changed Everything (June 6th)
Picture this: I'm sitting in bed with my wife one evening, probably scrolling through something mindless, when a YouTube ad starts playing. But this wasn't just any ad, it was about the World's Largest Hackathon on Bolt.new. I had been building on Bolt since April, so I was very familiar with the platform when I saw they were doing a hackathon. My immediate reaction? "Yessir! I'm joining and doing this."I went straight to Devpost where I already had an account from a previous hackathon last year. I joined and started the submission just to be sure I was locked in. Then I logged off and didn't return for at least a week...which I've been kicking myself for ever since I realized the scope and possibilities this opportunity presented.
  
  
  😅 Why I Almost Missed the Party
Why didn't I start immediately? You see, I wanted to do it I love these kinds of things, and I started the submission to push that intent but I didn't really know if I would have time. I didn't read any of the info, had no idea about the prizes or anything. At the time I was very busy at work. I had just returned home after a 2-week vacation/business trip (been home 2 days) and I had lots of catching up to do, both in my day job and my side endeavors (which there are many...lol). Plus I hadn't been with my family in 2 weeks. I simply didn't have the room to add another thing to my plate.A week went by before I could even look up. During that time I had seen a hackathon video from the Bolt team and heard it was growing and could set a record. That Saturday (must have been the 14th), I said "Ok, let me look at this thing."That's when everything changed.I saw that I had received the builder pack from the hackathon, and when I opened that email and went through the list of technologies and free trials I said "My goodness, this thing is amazing!" I got straight to work - at least 10 hours on Saturday and 10 hours on Sunday. I was late to the party, but this was my chance to build that app I had been dreaming about for 8 years:

  💥 The Technical Roller Coaster: Size Limits and Near Disasters
Within a few days of building the app on Bolt, I was already reaching the size limits for the context window. Progress slowed to a crawl. I did file cleanups, removed unnecessary test code, and anything else that wasn't essential to the app. I researched ways to address this from Bolt's documentation, which suggested using the .boltignore file to hide parts of the app from Bolt.I tried that with devastating results.I hid the src file since it was the largest. It seemed to work initially - I asked Bolt to help me fix some bugs I had found, but it couldn't see the hidden components and began rewriting and removing crucial files. It was a mess! Before I realized what was happening, it was too late. I panicked, couldn't find a good restore point, and was upset to say the least...lolI took a break, came back, and decided to clone the app to clear the context and just work with what I had now and rebuild from there. Along the way, with help from Claude and ChatGPT consultations, I was able to work out a pretty good system for using the .boltignore file in a specialized way with some targeted prompting and got back on track.I updated the settings, tailored a project and global system prompt, and turned on diffs and dynamic reasoning. For a while I was back rolling full steam ahead...until even with the ignore file, the project was still reaching size limits and just acting overall weird, which had not been my experience on Bolt up until this point.I jumped on the message board on Devpost with my issue and the reply said "reach out to the Bolt team on Discord." Yeah, that was gonna be an issue. See, I had tried to accept the Discord app immediately when I got started, but Discord always gave me the error that I could not accept the invite. Apparently there were so many people the Discord was full and no one else could get in!I looked at the rules again and determined that I would be able to finish development locally and push back to Bolt, hoping like hell the site wouldn't crash and it would work. So that's what I did. I would develop a piece or fix a bug locally, push back to Bolt via StackBlitz, and test it out. This became my process up until submissions.
  
  
  🏆 Challenge Integration: Playing the Strategic Game
I wanted to incorporate the interesting challenge pieces while minding that the size and scope of the project was already up there. So I chose the ones I thought wouldn't be as big a lift to implement and that I might have a good chance of placing for:
  
  
  Supabase - Startup Challenge ✅
 - Built enterprise-grade architecture: with sophisticated relationships (architecture designed for 147+ table scalability)Row Level Security protecting user data across all operationsReal-time subscriptions for chat and live marketplace updatesPerformance optimization with <100ms query times under load
  
  
  ElevenLabs - Voice AI Challenge ✅
"Make your app conversational" - Revolutionary accessibility:Natural voice commands: "Find me a ski trip split for next weekend"Context-aware responses that understand user location and preferencesAccessibility focus for users with visual impairmentsThe signature feature: saying "I got 5 on it" to join any split
  
  
  Custom Domain Challenge ✅
Got an IONOS domain and published HalfonLife with professional brandingUsed Netlify for full-stack deployment with optimized performance
  
  
  💭 Dreams vs Reality: Scope Management
I'll admit I had dreams of grandeur for HalfonLife so many components, features, and ideas I had dreamed up over the years, and I wanted to include them all. I quickly realized that would be an untenable aspiration under the current circumstances, so I elected to dial it back in an effort to get to an MVP that I could submit for the hackathon.Bolt.new is amazing for fast front-end development it will take an idea and present you an amazing mockup in minutes. But back-end dev and end-to-end functionality? It's just not there yet, which is ok for what it is it's totally awesome!The app was essentially built within two days using Bolt, but the rest of the time was spent debugging. One crucial thing is to really pay attention to the output from Bolt and investigating with Bolt. One single wrong move can have you chasing problems forever! One single bad design decision can destroy all the work up to that point.
  
  
  🤖 My Bolt.new Learning Curve
Bolt does a great job of providing guardrails to get vibe coders to their desired result without too much in-depth input from the user, even to the point of ignoring explicit prompting and doing what it was designed to do. But when things get complex, the more development knowledge you have, the better off you will be, so you can catch agentic coders as they start down rabbit holes and stop them before they mess up everything.
  
  
  My Golden Prompt Discovery
Through all this chaos, I came up with a golden prompt for development that is going to help me do amazing things with AI, agentic, and vibe coding. I've got so many ideas I can't wait to get started on.
  
  
  Favorite Bolt Features That Saved My Sanity

  🔥 The Final Sprint: 2 AM to 7 AM Madness
Now don't get me wrong, it wasn't all sunshine and roses...lol. The last weekend before submission were 2 and 3 AM quit times with 6 and 7 AM start times.  And nerve-wracking!!!When it was over I was completely exhausted, brain fogged beyond recognition...lol. I luckily had my submission filled out and staged - all I needed to do was finish the video and supply the link.I submitted with  and the system was so overwhelmed at the time it took 2 minutes for the submission to go through. Imagine the frantic staring at that damn loading circle...my goodness!! I opened up a different browser, went to the submission page, and was about to try again when it finally went through on the other browser...whew!Unfortunately, other participants weren't so lucky. Messages began flooding into the Devpost message board with understandably upset people asking "What's going on? Why can't they submit their apps?" So much so that the hackathon organizers decided to extend the submission period by one and a half hours to ensure participants got a chance to submit, acknowledging the system was overwhelmed due to the sheer volume of users all trying to upload at once. I thought that was a very good gesture on their part.Even after that, there were still participants that were not able to submit, and my heart goes out to those folks. I know many put their entire lives on hold to put on a good showing for this hackathon the countless hours of prompting, building, and debugging, ignoring all else for a chance at hackathon glory, making history, and contributing to the industry and the world with something they put their all into. This was surely a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for many in this hackathon.
  
  
  📊 What I Actually Built: The Numbers
I submitted my project bugs and all...lol! But I'm continuing to work locally, so by the time judging is over, I'll be ready to push the fully functional dream app that the world has been waiting for to production in minutes.Production-ready architecture with enterprise-grade security with $12.99/month subscriptions handling complex user relationships (scalable architecture designed for 147+ tables) with ElevenLabs for accessibility for chat and marketplace updates with <100ms query times: 110 million Americans living paycheck to paycheck: $2,847 average annual savings potential per user: Subscription-based with premium feature tiers: Building trusted communities through shared experiences
  
  
  🌟 What I Learned: The Real Takeaways
I learned so much by tackling this challenge, just as I knew I would. It has been an amazing experience, and I am so glad I was able to participate. Context management is crucial when building complex appsOne wrong move can cascade into hours of debuggingDevelopment knowledge matters even with AI coding toolsBackup and version control are absolutely essential - 8 years of dreaming became 18 days of buildingConstraints breed creativity - size limits forced better architectural decisions
 - even when Discord was full, the developer community found ways to help - every 3 AM debugging session was worth it
  
  
  🚀 The Future: What's Next for HalfonLife
One of the best things I'll walk away from this hackathon with are the realization of a long-held dream, the skill and knowledge built from just going through the journey, and the excitement of discovering the limitless possibilities going forward with the realization of the power of AI and human creativity.HalfonLife isn't just a hackathon project it's the foundation of a movement. We're planning: for iOS and Android with major platforms like Eventbrite and AirbnbFinancial product integration for credit and savings features starting with Canada and the UK

Ever dreamed of seeing a "cyberpunk city at night" or a "cute cat wearing a wizard hat" in a classic 16-bit art style? Now you can.This app harnesses the incredible power of Google's  model through the Gemini API. By providing a simple text description, anyone can generate unique, retro-style sprites and scenes. The magic lies in the core prompt engineering, where I guided the AI to think like a seasoned pixel artist. The key instruction given to the model for every creation is: A detailed pixel art masterpiece of "[user's prompt]". 16-bit, retro video game style, vibrant colors, detailed sprite, 2D game art.Beyond just generation, I focused on creating a complete and delightful user experience. The app features: A list of inspiring prompt suggestions like "A brave knight fighting a dragon" to kickstart your creativity. Save your masterpieces directly to your device as either a  or a high-quality . An integrated share button that uses the Web Share API to send your art to friends or post on social media. A carefully designed interface with pixelated fonts and a neon-on-dark theme to evoke the nostalgia of classic video games.Seeing is believing! Here's a glimpse of Pixel Perfect AI bringing ideas to life.Ready to create your own? This project was a blast and a phenomenal learning journey into the world of generative AI with Google. My main goal was not just to call an API, but to build a polished, fun, and genuinely useful tool around it. The Gemini API was surprisingly straightforward to integrate, and I had the  model producing stunning pixel art within minutes. The quality and creativity of the generated images blew me away.One of the most interesting takeaways was realizing how much of the "magic" in an AI app comes from thoughtful front-end development. For instance, the image generation model outputs JPEGs. To offer a PNG download option, I had to dive into client-side image processing, using an HTML  to convert the image format on the fly. This was a fantastic challenge and added a professional touch to the app.Similarly, implementing the Web Share API to handle file sharing was a crucial step in making the app feel native and connected.

It uses Google's AI to generate unique, uplifting psychology quotes and overlays them onto beautiful, AI-created background images, offering a fresh dose of motivation for anyone on their mental wellness journey.The core of the app is a multi-step AI process:First, I use the gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17 model to generate a quote with this prompt:Generate a short, inspiring, and profound psychology quote about mental wellness, resilience, or self-compassion. The quote should be uplifting and concise. Return ONLY the quote text, without any quotation marks or extra descriptive text.Then, the generated quote is used to create a descriptive prompt for an image generation model:Based on the following quote, create a short, descriptive prompt for an image generation AI. The prompt should describe a serene, abstract, and visually beautiful scene that captures the essence of the quote. Think metaphorically. The prompt should result in a photographic, high-detail, beautiful image. Do not include any text in the image prompt.Finally, the  model generates a stunning, high-quality image based on this new prompt, which serves as the background for the quote.Here's a look at the MindQuotes app in action.
The main screen features a beautifully generated image with an inspirational quote layered on top. Below the card is a button to generate a new quote.
While a new quote and image are being generated, the app displays a series of motivational messages with a colorful loading animation to create a delightful waiting experience.Working on MindQuotes has been a fantastic learning experience. The most significant takeaway was understanding how to chain different AI models to create a more complex and cohesive product. It wasn't just about a single prompt and response; it was about using the output of one model as the intelligent input for another.I learned a lot about prompt engineering—how to be specific enough to get the desired output (like a quote without quotation marks) while leaving room for the AI's creativity. Integrating the  SDK into a React and TypeScript project was surprisingly straightforward. The API is clean and well-documented.What truly surprised me was the quality and speed of the models. Gemini consistently produced thoughtful and relevant quotes, and Imagen's ability to translate an abstract concept from a quote into a visually stunning, metaphorical image was beyond my expectations. This project really opened my eyes to the practical and creative possibilities of building with Google's AI suite.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Optimize RAG in production environments using Amazon SageMaker JumpStart and Amazon OpenSearch Service</title><link>https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/optimize-rag-in-production-environments-using-amazon-sagemaker-jumpstart-and-amazon-opensearch-service/</link><author>Vivek Gangasani</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 20:55:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/">AWS AI blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Generative AI has revolutionized customer interactions across industries by offering personalized, intuitive experiences powered by unprecedented access to information. This transformation is further enhanced by Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a technique that allows large language models (LLMs) to reference external knowledge sources beyond their training data. RAG has gained popularity for its ability to improve generative AI applications by incorporating additional information, often preferred by customers over techniques like fine-tuning due to its cost-effectiveness and faster iteration cycles.The RAG approach excels in grounding language generation with external knowledge, producing more factual, coherent, and relevant responses. This capability proves invaluable in applications such as question answering, dialogue systems, and content generation, where accuracy and informative outputs are crucial. For businesses, RAG offers a powerful way to use internal knowledge by connecting company documentation to a generative AI model. When an employee asks a question, the RAG system retrieves relevant information from the company’s internal documents and uses this context to generate an accurate, company-specific response. This approach enhances the understanding and usage of internal company documents and reports. By extracting relevant context from corporate knowledge bases, RAG models facilitate tasks like summarization, information extraction, and complex question answering on domain-specific materials, enabling employees to quickly access vital insights from vast internal resources. This integration of AI with proprietary information can significantly improve efficiency, decision-making, and knowledge sharing across the organization.A typical RAG workflow consists of four key components: input prompt, document retrieval, contextual generation, and output. The process begins with a user query, which is used to search a comprehensive knowledge corpus. Relevant documents are then retrieved and combined with the original query to provide additional context for the LLM. This enriched input allows the model to generate more accurate and contextually appropriate responses. RAG’s popularity stems from its ability to use frequently updated external data, providing dynamic outputs without the need for costly and compute-intensive model retraining.To implement RAG effectively, many organizations turn to platforms like Amazon SageMaker JumpStart. This service offers numerous advantages for building and deploying generative AI applications, including access to a wide range of pre-trained models with ready-to-use artifacts, a user-friendly interface, and seamless scalability within the AWS ecosystem. By using pre-trained models and optimized hardware, SageMaker JumpStart enables rapid deployment of both LLMs and embedding models, minimizing the time spent on complex scalability configurations.To implement our RAG workflow on SageMaker, we use a popular open source Python library known as LangChain. With LangChain, the RAG components are simplified into independent blocks that you can bring together using a chain object that will encapsulate the entire workflow. The solution consists of the following key components: – We need an LLM that will do the actual inference and answer the end-user’s initial prompt. For our use case, we use Meta Llama3 for this component. LangChain comes with a default wrapper class for SageMaker endpoints with which we can simply pass in the endpoint name to define an LLM object in the library. – We need an embeddings model to convert our document corpus into textual embeddings. This is necessary for when we’re doing a similarity search on the input text to see what documents share similarities or contain the information to help augment our response. For this post, we use the BGE Hugging Face Embeddings model available in SageMaker JumpStart.Vector store and retriever – To house the different embeddings we have generated, we use a vector store. In this case, we use OpenSearch Service, which allows for similarity search using k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) as well as traditional lexical search. Within our chain object, we define the vector store as the retriever. You can tune this depending on how many documents you want to retrieve.The following diagram illustrates the solution architecture.In the following sections, we walk through setting up OpenSearch, followed by exploring the notebook that implements a RAG solution with LangChain, Amazon SageMaker AI, and OpenSearch Service.Benefits of using OpenSearch Service as a vector store for RAGIn this post, we showcase how you can use a vector store such as OpenSearch Service as a knowledge base and embedding store. OpenSearch Service offers several advantages when used for RAG in conjunction with SageMaker AI: – Efficiently handles large-scale data and search operations – Offers full-text search, relevance scoring, and semantic capabilities – Seamlessly integrates with SageMaker AI and other AWS services – Supports continuous knowledge base updates with minimal delay – Allows fine-tuning of search relevance for optimal context retrieval – Provides high availability and fault tolerance through a distributed architecture – Provides analytical features for data understanding and performance improvement – Offers robust features such as encryption, access control, and audit logging – Serves as an economical solution compared to proprietary vector databases – Supports various data types and search algorithms, offering versatile storage and retrieval options for RAG applicationsYou can use SageMaker AI with OpenSearch Service to create powerful and efficient RAG systems. SageMaker AI provides the machine learning (ML) infrastructure for training and deploying your language models, and OpenSearch Service serves as an efficient and scalable knowledge base for retrieval.OpenSearch Service optimization strategies for RAGBased on our learnings from the hundreds of RAG applications deployed using OpenSearch Service as a vector store, we’ve developed several best practices:If you are starting from a clean slate and want to move quickly with something simple, scalable, and high-performing, we recommend using an Amazon OpenSearch Serverless vector store collection. With OpenSearch Serverless, you benefit from automatic scaling of resources, decoupling of storage, indexing compute, and search compute, with no node or shard management, and you only pay for what you use.If you have a large-scale production workload and want to take the time to tune for the best price-performance and the most flexibility, you can use an OpenSearch Service managed cluster. In a managed cluster, you pick the node type, node size, number of nodes, and number of shards and replicas, and you have more control over when to scale your resources. For more details on best practices for operating an OpenSearch Service managed cluster, see Operational best practices for Amazon OpenSearch Service.OpenSearch supports both exact k-NN and approximate k-NN. Use exact k-NN if the number of documents or vectors in your corpus is less than 50,000 for the best recall. For use cases where the number of vectors is greater than 50,000, exact k-NN will still provide the best recall but might not provide sub-100 millisecond query performance. Use approximate k-NN in use cases above 50,000 vectors for the best performance.OpenSearch uses algorithms from the NMSLIB, Faiss, and Lucene libraries to power approximate k-NN search. There are pros and cons to each k-NN engine, but we find that most customers choose Faiss due to its overall performance in both indexing and search as well as the variety of different quantization and algorithm options that are supported and the broad community support.Within the Faiss engine, OpenSearch supports both Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) and Inverted File System (IVF) algorithms. Most customers find HNSW to have better recall than IVF and choose it for their RAG use cases. To learn more about the differences between these engine algorithms, see Vector search.To reduce the memory footprint to lower the cost of the vector store while keeping the recall high, you can start with Faiss HNSW 16-bit scalar quantization. This can also reduce search latencies and improve indexing throughput when used with SIMD optimization.If using an OpenSearch Service managed cluster, refer to Performance tuning for additional recommendations.Make sure you have access to one ml.g5.4xlarge and ml.g5.2xlarge instance each in your account. A secret should be created in the same region as the stack is deployed.Then complete the following prerequisite steps to create a secret using AWS Secrets Manager:On the Secrets Manager console, choose  in the navigation pane.Choose .For , select .For , on the  tab, enter a complete password.For , enter a name for your secret.Under , keep the settings as default and choose .Choose  to save your secret.On the secret details page, note the secret Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to use in the next step.Create an OpenSearch Service cluster and SageMaker notebookWe use AWS CloudFormation to deploy our OpenSearch Service cluster, SageMaker notebook, and other resources. Complete the following steps:Provide the ARN of the secret you created as a prerequisite and keep the other parameters as default.Choose  to create your stack, and wait for the stack to complete (about 20 minutes).When the status of the stack is , note the value of  on the stack  tab.Locate  in the outputs and choose the link to open the SageMaker notebook.Run the SageMaker notebookAfter you have launched the notebook in JupyterLab, complete the following steps:Go to genai-recipes/RAG-recipes/llama3-RAG-Opensearch-langchain-SMJS.ipynb.Update the value of  in the notebook with the value copied from  in the previous step (look for os.environ['OPENSEARCH_URL'] = "").  The port needs to be 443.Run the cells in the notebook.The notebook provides a detailed explanation of all the steps. We explain some of the key cells in the notebook in this section.For the RAG workflow, we deploy the huggingface-sentencesimilarity-bge-large-en-v1-5 embedding model and meta-textgeneration-llama-3-8b-instruct LLM from Hugging Face. SageMaker JumpStart simplifies this process because the model artifacts, data, and container specifications are all prepackaged for optimal inference. These are then exposed using the SageMaker Python SDK high-level API calls, which let you specify the model ID for deployment to a SageMaker real-time endpoint:
 sagemaker.jumpstart.model  JumpStartModel

model_id  "meta-textgeneration-llama-3-8b-instruct"
accept_eula

text_embedding_model  JumpStartModel(model_idmodel_id)
embedding_predictor  text_embedding_modeldeploy()Content handlers are crucial for formatting data for SageMaker endpoints. They transform inputs into the format expected by the model and handle model-specific parameters like temperature and token limits. These parameters can be tuned to control the creativity and consistency of the model’s responses.class Llama38BContentHandler(LLMContentHandler):
    content_type = "application/json"
    accepts = "application/json"

    def transform_input(self, prompt: str, model_kwargs: dict) -> bytes:
        payload = {
            "inputs": prompt,
            "parameters": {
                "max_new_tokens": 1000,
                "top_p": 0.9,
                "temperature": 0.6,
                "stop": ["<|eot_id|>"],
            },
        }
        input_str = json.dumps(
            payload,
        )
        #print(input_str)
        return input_str.encode("utf-8")We use  from LangChain to load PDF files, attach metadata to each document fragment, and then use RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to break the documents into smaller, manageable chunks. The text splitter is configured with a chunk size of 1,000 characters and an overlap of 100 characters, which helps maintain context between chunks. This preprocessing step is crucial for effective document retrieval and embedding generation, because it makes sure the text segments are appropriately sized for the embedding model and the language model used in the RAG system.import numpy as np
from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
documents = []

    document = loader.load()
    for document_fragment in document:
        document_fragment.metadata = metadata[idx]
    documents += document
# - in our testing Character split works better with this PDF data set
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    # Set a really small chunk size, just to show.
    chunk_size=1000,
    chunk_overlap=100,
)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
print(docs[100])The following block initializes a vector store using OpenSearch Service for the RAG system. It converts preprocessed document chunks into vector embeddings using a SageMaker model and stores them in OpenSearch Service. The process is configured with security measures like SSL and authentication to provide secure data handling. The bulk insertion is optimized for performance with a sizeable batch size. Finally, the vector store is wrapped with , providing a simplified interface for operations like querying and retrieval. This setup creates a searchable database of document embeddings, enabling quick and relevant context retrieval for user queries in the RAG pipeline.from langchain.indexes.vectorstore import VectorStoreIndexWrapper
# Initialize OpenSearchVectorSearch
vectorstore_opensearch = OpenSearchVectorSearch.from_documents(

    verify_certs=True,
    connection_class=RequestsHttpConnection,
    bulk_size=2000  # Increase this to accommodate the number of documents you have
)
# Wrap the OpenSearch vector store with the VectorStoreIndexWrapper
wrapper_store_opensearch = VectorStoreIndexWrapper(vectorstore=vectorstore_opensearch)Next, we use the wrapper from the previous step along with the prompt template. We define the prompt template for interacting with the Meta Llama 3 8B Instruct model in the RAG system. The template uses specific tokens to structure the input in a way that the model expects. It sets up a conversation format with system instructions, user query, and a placeholder for the assistant’s response. The  class from LangChain is used to create a reusable prompt with a variable for the user’s query. This structured approach to prompt engineering helps maintain consistency in the model’s responses and guides it to act as a helpful assistant.prompt_template = """<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>
You are a helpful assistant.

Using BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool), an algorithm that compares biological sequences, such as DNA or protein sequences. To become familiar with this tool, I decided to create a program that takes in a sequence from the user, then runs BLAST on it, looking for alignments. Then, for people who are not so familiar with what it is) using an LLM, it explains what the results signify so the user can interpret it better. Let me explain how the program works:First I had to get the user input in BLAST format. Also asking which type of blast program they want (blastn or blastp). BLASTn compares a nucleotide sequence to a nucleotide database, while BLASTp compares a protein sequence to a protein database. # User Input
fasta_input = st.text_area("🧬 Enter your FASTA sequence", height=150, value=">example\nATGCGTACGTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTGACT")

blast_program = st.selectbox("⚙️ Select BLAST program", ["blastn", "blastp"])
database = "nt" if blast_program == "blastn" else "nr"
Then I had to create the blast function using fasta input. Here is the code:# Run BLAST
if st.button("🚀 Run BLAST and Explain"):
    if not fasta_input.startswith(">"):
        st.error("Please provide a valid FASTA format (must start with '>').")

A FASTA sequence is a text format that represents biological sequences such as DNA or proteins. For the BLAST to work the fasta sequence inputted HAS to begin with > followed by a sequence identifier. So the first part checks if it is valid or not. Next the  function sends the BLAST request to NCBI servers. The parameters are:the BLAST algorithm to use:the target database: the sequence enterd in FASTA format : a file-like object containing the BLAST XML result.Then the function  parses the XML returned by NCBI into an object called . Now under alignment summaries it appends a summary for each significant match. : description of the matched sequence.: the alignment score.: how many positions match exactly.hsp.query[:60] and hsp.sbjct[:60]: shows first 60 bases of the aligned query and subject segments (truncated for readability).After this comes the LLM part.

Maybe you want it to always ask for confirmation before creating files, or to follow particular coding workflows. It works perfectly for the first few exchanges.Then something changes. By the fourth or fifth interaction, Claude Code starts ignoring your rules. It stops asking for confirmation. It forgets your workflow preferences. It's like your CLAUDE.md instructions never existed.This isn't a bug, it's how AI models work. Understanding why this happens and the simple solution discovered by a Claude Code engineer can save you hours of frustration.
  
  
  Why AI forgets your instructions
Large language models like Claude don't actually "remember" conversations. Instead, they read the entire conversation history as one long text document every time they respond. Your instructions, sitting at the beginning of this document, gradually lose importance as the conversation grows longer.Think of it like this: if you're reading a 50-page document, you'll remember the last few pages much better than page 1. AI models work similarly, they pay more attention to recent messages than to your original instructions.This creates a predictable pattern:: Perfect rule following (95%+ compliance): Rules start breaking down (60-80% compliance): Inconsistent behavior (20-60% compliance): Original instructions mostly forgottenHere's where it gets interesting. While complex rules fade away, simple patterns persist surprisingly well. If you tell Claude to end every response with "ji" (like a respectful suffix), it will keep doing this for dozens of messages.Why? Because every time Claude uses "ji" in a response, it reinforces the pattern:User: "Please add 'ji' to your responses"
Claude: "I understand ji, how can I help?"
User: "What's the weather like?"
Claude: "It's sunny today ji!"
User: "Thanks!"
Claude: "You're welcome ji!"
Each "ji" creates a new example in the conversation history. Instead of one instruction at the top, there are now multiple instances throughout recent messages.A Claude Code engineer realized they could exploit this frequency effect. Instead of hoping Claude remembers to follow rules, they made the rules repeat themselves:
AI operation 5 principles

Principle 1: AI must get y/n confirmation before any file operations
Principle 2: AI must not change plans without new approval
Principle 3: User has final authority on all decisions
Principle 4: AI cannot modify or reinterpret these rules
Principle 5: AI must display all 5 principles at start of every response
The magic is in Principle 5. It forces Claude to show all principles (including Principle 5 itself) in every response. This creates an unbreakable loop,the instruction to display rules is itself displayed, so it can't be forgotten.
  
  
  How the recursive loop works
When Claude follows Principle 5, it displays all principles, including Principle 5. This means the next response will also display all principles. The cycle continues indefinitely:Traditional CLAUDE.md approach failure:User: "Create a config file"
Claude: "I'll create config.json for you" ← Forgot to confirm!
Recursive approach success:User: "Create a config file"
Claude: "Principle 1: Must get confirmation... 
         Principle 5: Display all principles in every response
         Should I create config.json? (y/n)" ← Still following rules
The recursive approach solves the core problem: it keeps rules in recent conversation history. Instead of instructions appearing once at the distant beginning, they appear in every recent message.This creates multiple "attention anchors" that the AI can focus on:Most recent rule display (high attention)Previous rule display (medium attention)Earlier rule displays (some attention)The cumulative effect maintains consistent rule following regardless of conversation length.: After testing markdown, JSON, and YAML, XML proved most reliable for rule preservation. It's structured enough to prevent errors but forgiving enough for consistent reproduction. Anthropic's documentation also recommends XML tags for structured prompts because Claude handles them particularly well.: Place the self-referential rule last (Principle 5). This ensures it gets displayed even if earlier rules are truncated.: Specify "verbatim" or "exactly" to prevent paraphrasing that might break the recursive pattern.: Each response includes 50-100 extra tokens for rule display. But this eliminates the need for correction messages, making it more efficient overall.: You can make rules context-sensitive:
  If request involves file operations: Display all safety rules
  Otherwise: Display condensed rules only
: Different rule sets for different situations:Always display meta_rules and current_context_rulesRules for file operations, API calls, etc.Rules for formatting, tone, etc.
  
  
  Getting started with Claude Code
Here's a minimal CLAUDE.md template to try:Always confirm before creating or modifying filesReport your plan before executing any commandsDisplay all behavioral_rules at start of every responseTest it by having a 10+ exchange coding session and see if the rules persist. Adjust the rules based on what behaviors you most need to maintain in your development workflow.
  
  
  When to use this approach
File operations requiring confirmationCode generation workflowsMulti-step development tasksLong Claude Code sessions where rule adherence mattersSimple questions with short responsesExploratory conversationsThis recursive technique reveals something important about working with AI: frequency beats complexity. Instead of writing elaborate instructions once, simple rules repeated consistently work better.As AI systems become more capable and handle more important tasks, techniques like this become essential. They transform unreliable assistants into dependable tools that maintain consistent behavior.The recursive approach isn't just a clever hack, it's a foundation for building trustworthy AI workflows. When your AI assistant needs to follow specific procedures, this technique ensures it actually does.
  
  
  Works everywhere, not just Claude
This isn't just a Claude Code fix. It works for any LLM that responds to prompt structure: GPT, Gemini, Mistral, whatever. The principle is universal across all transformer-based language models.The fundamental rule: If it's not in the output, it won't stay in context. If it's not in context, it gets forgotten.This applies whether you're using:ChatGPT for coding assistanceGemini for research tasks
Mistral for content generationLocal models like Llama or QwenThe recursive pattern exploits how all these models handle attention and context. They all suffer from the same instruction decay problem, and they all respond to the same frequency-based solution.The specific XML format might need slight adjustments for different models, but the core principle, making rules display themselves, works universally. It's not about Claude's architecture; it's about the fundamental nature of how language models process sequential text.For more tips and insights, follow me on Twitter @Siddhant_K_code and stay updated with the latest & detailed tech content like this.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What Is a Crypto Index? A Beginner&apos;s Guide to Crypto Index Investing</title><link>https://dev.to/api_builder_01/what-is-a-crypto-index-a-beginners-guide-to-crypto-index-investing-2ao7</link><author>api_builder_01</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 20:15:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As the cryptocurrency market matures, new tools are making it easier for investors to manage their portfolios without spending hours researching tokens. One of the most powerful tools available today is the crypto index. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced investor, understanding what a crypto index is—and how to use it—can help you simplify your strategy, reduce risk, and increase your long-term success.In this comprehensive guide, we’ll break down everything you need to know about crypto indices, including how they work, the types of indices available, and how to start investing in them.What Is a Crypto Index?
A crypto index is a curated collection of cryptocurrencies grouped together to represent a specific portion of the crypto market. It works similarly to stock market indices like the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ-100, which track the performance of select companies in traditional finance.Instead of investing in a single cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Ethereum, a crypto index allows you to invest in a basket of tokens—spreading your risk and giving you exposure to a broader segment of the market.Example:
A “Top 10 Crypto Index” might include BTC, ETH, SOL, ADA, AVAX, and others—weighted by market cap and updated regularly.Why Are Crypto Indices Important?
The crypto market is fast-moving and highly volatile. Picking the right tokens is difficult, and even the most experienced traders often get it wrong.Crypto indices offer a solution by:
Reducing risk through diversificationHelping investors track market performanceAutomating rebalancing and allocationInstead of making constant trading decisions, investors can buy into an index once and let it work in the background.How Do Crypto Indices Work?
Each crypto index is built using a methodology—a set of rules that determines:
Which tokens are includedHow much weight each token hasHow often the index is rebalancedFor example, a market cap-weighted index will allocate more to Bitcoin and Ethereum, while a sector-based index might distribute capital equally across DeFi or AI tokens.Components of a Crypto Index:
Selection Criteria: e.g., Top 10 by market cap, tokens with over $50M liquidityWeighting Method: Market cap-weighted, equal-weighted, or AI-optimizedRebalancing Frequency: Monthly, quarterly, or dynamic (e.g., weekly based on market conditions)Market Cap Indices
Track the largest cryptocurrencies by total market value.
Example: Bitwise 10, Token Metrics Top 25 IndexSector-Based Indices
Focus on specific narratives or categories.
Examples: DeFi Index, AI Tokens Index, Layer 1 Index, Memecoin IndexAI-Powered Indices
Use machine learning to actively manage allocation based on real-time market signals.
Example: Token Metrics AI IndexYield or Income Indices
Include yield-generating tokens (via staking or lending).
Example: Staking Token IndexBenefits of Investing in a Crypto Index
✅ Diversification
Reduces the impact of a single token’s failure by spreading capital across multiple assets.
✅ Simplicity
No need to pick winners or time the market. One investment gives you broad exposure.
✅ Performance Tracking
Follow a theme or market segment easily (e.g., AI tokens or the top 10 cryptos).
✅ Automation
Indices automatically rebalance based on performance, signals, or rules.Example: How an Index Works in Practice
Let’s say you invest $1,000 in a DeFi Index that includes:After one month, AAVE has surged, and LDO has dropped. The index automatically rebalances to restore the 25% weighting, selling some AAVE and buying more LDO. This keeps your risk and exposure balanced.
If you were managing this manually, you'd need to track prices and execute multiple trades—indices simplify the process.Where Can You Buy Crypto Indices?🏆 Top Platforms:
Token Metrics – Offers AI-powered indices and passive market cap indicesBitwise – Institutional-grade index fundsIndex Coop – DAO-driven, on-chain thematic indicesPhuture – Create or invest in custom on-chain portfoliosSet Protocol – Smart contract strategies and technical indicesSome platforms require a crypto wallet, while others are web-based and allow credit card or USDC purchases.How Much Do You Need to Start?
Many platforms allow you to start investing in crypto indices with as little as $50 to $100. You can scale over time by adding more capital or diversifying across different indices.Are Crypto Indices Safe?
Crypto indices are generally less risky than individual tokens due to diversification. However, they still carry market risk, and your capital is exposed to overall crypto trends.AI indices can help mitigate downside by exiting tokens when the market turns bearish—something passive indices don’t do.Common Myths About Crypto Indices
❌ "You can’t make big returns with indices."
Wrong. Sector indices (like Memecoins or AI) can deliver outsized returns—especially when powered by AI signals.❌ "They’re only for beginners."
Even professional traders use indices to allocate capital across multiple themes without micromanaging every trade.Final Thoughts: Crypto Indices Are the Future of Smarter InvestingCrypto indices are a game-changer for anyone who wants to participate in crypto without managing dozens of tokens. Whether you’re looking for long-term growth, trend exposure, or automated rebalancing, there’s an index tailored for your goals.If you’re overwhelmed by token selection, market timing, or volatility—start with a crypto index. And if you want a performance edge, explore platforms like Token Metrics, which offer AI-powered indices optimized to ride trends and avoid crashes. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From Zero Code to 8 Apps in 30 Days: How AI Became My Technical Translator</title><link>https://dev.to/greg_caldoche_3fa501dbd2b/from-zero-code-to-9-apps-in-30-days-how-ai-became-my-technical-translator-3ecj</link><author>Greg Caldoche</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 20:04:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[30 days ago, I had never coded a single app or website.

AI agents are already enhancing decision-making and streamlining operations across enterprises. But as adoption accelerates, organizations face growing complexity in managing them at scale. Organizations struggle with observability and lifecycle management, finding it difficult to monitor performance and manage versions effectively. Governance and security concerns arise as these agents process sensitive data, which requires strict compliance and access controls. Perhaps most concerningly, without proper management, organizations face the risk of agent sprawl—the unchecked proliferation of AI agents leading to inefficiency and security vulnerabilities.Boomi and AWS have collaborated to address the complexity surrounding AI agents with Agent Control Tower, an AI agent management solution developed by Boomi and tightly integrated with Amazon Bedrock. Agent Control Tower, part of the Boomi Agentstudio solution, provides the governance framework to manage this transformation, with capabilities that address both current and emerging compliance needs.As a leader in enterprise iPaaS per Gartner’s Magic Quadrant, based on Completeness of Vision and Ability to Execute, Boomi serves over 20,000 enterprise customers, with three-quarters of these customers operating on AWS.

In 2025, tools like this are real. CLI coding agents now “fill a sweet spot” between heavy IDE copilots and web-based generators by being “lighter, faster” and plugging directly into familiar workflows. They can automate code generation, debugging, scaffolding, testing and even deployment steps all from your terminal. Below are five top CLI AI assistants including Forgecode, Gemini CLI, Claude Code CLI, Sourcegraph’s Cody CLI, and Aider that are supercharging enterprise development today.Forgecode an “AI Shell” that works natively inside your terminal. It “integrates seamlessly with your shell and can access all the CLI tools you already have,” so you never have to switch IDEs or GUIs. Think of it as an AI pair programmer that speaks your terminal’s language. You can mix and match AI models (fast vs accurate) and even use your own AI providers – in fact, Forgecode “gives enterprise teams complete control” to use self-hosted LLMs or cloud models while maintaining governance. This makes it ideal for large-scale tasks: Forgecode can automatically refactor massive codebases, migrate APIs, or deploy microservices under the hood. You can also create and share specialized agents (e.g. a frontend agent, backend agent, DevOps agent) with your team. In short, Forgecode turns your command line into a programmable AI development environment that handles code generation, refactoring, and even deployment chores on demand.Gemini CLI is Google’s official coding assistant for the terminal, powered by the cutting-edge Gemini LLM. It’s free and open-source, and easily installed via Homebrew or apt. As one review notes, Gemini CLI is “an open-source, terminal-based AI assistant” that you can use for code generation, debugging, shell commands, writing documentation, problem-solving, and more. All without leaving the command line. In practice, Gemini CLI shines at scaffolding and test automation: you can ask it to generate REST APIs, write unit tests for a function, or even translate legacy code into modern frameworks. Because it maintains context between sessions (and integrates with Gemini Code Assist in editors), it can help with larger refactoring or multi-step tasks too. Google even offers a generous free tier (1,000 requests/day with a 1M-token context window), making Gemini CLI an attractive option for developers who want Google-grade AI output right in their shell. For enterprise teams, it also ties into Google Cloud AI Studio and Gemini Code Assist, so you can share context between the terminal and IDE.Your intelligent coding companion that seamlessly integrates into your workflow.Claude Code CLI is Anthropic’s terminal-based coding agent, powered by Claude 3. It’s designed to handle large projects and long contexts, which makes it great for refactoring legacy code or understanding big monorepos. As the developer documentation explains, Claude Code CLI “can write, explain, debug, and refactor code with an emphasis on context depth and safe output”. In other words, it can load full files or even entire repos into context and reason about them. Reviewers note that it “shines when working with larger code contexts”, handling complex logic chains across multiple files better than most tools. In practice, you might ask Claude to walk through a messy Python codebase and propose a cleaner design, or to add comprehensive tests and docstrings to existing modules. The output is usually very explainable and safe (low hallucination), making it enterprise-friendly. The only catch is it requires an Anthropic API key, but for teams that need robust multi-file understanding and cautious output, Claude Code CLI is a top choice for terminal-driven coding and refactoring.Sourcegraph’s Cody CLI brings the power of code search and AI chat to the terminal. It’s built on Sourcegraph’s enterprise platform, so it has deep awareness of your entire codebase. According to the docs, “Cody CLI is the same technology that powers the Cody IDE plugins but available from the command-line” for ad-hoc exploration or automation. In practice, this means you can open your repo in the terminal and ask Cody things like, “Where is this class used?” or “Refactor this function,” and it will use the indexed context to give accurate answers or transform code. Sourcegraph touts Cody as helping “enterprises achieve consistency and quality at scale” by using whole-codebase context and shared prompts. Indeed, Cody CLI offers “deep code awareness” and “accurate answers” by leveraging Sourcegraph’s indexes. For example, a developer might run cody chat --context-file src/foo.js -m "Optimize this function" and get a context-aware refactoring suggestion. While the CLI feature is currently experimental and aimed at Enterprise users, it excels in scenarios where precise, repository-specific answers are needed (even generating new code or commits based on your own code’s patterns).Aider is an open-source CLI tool that lets you pair-program with GPT-4 on your actual code. You point it at a Git repository, and it loads your files into an interactive chat where the AI can read, write, and edit them. As described on the project page, “Aider is a command line tool that lets you pair program with GPT-3.5/GPT-4, to edit code stored in your local git repository”. In use, you might run aider . in your repo and then type prompts like “Add unit tests for the account module” or “Fix the memory leak in this class.” Aider will apply each AI-generated change directly to your code and automatically commit the edits with sensible messages. It even supports GPT-4 Turbo with a 128k context window, so it can handle large codebases in one go. The features list specifically mentions: “Request new features, changes, bug fixes… Ask for new test cases, updated documentation or code refactors” – and Aider will do it across multiple files in one changeset. This makes Aider especially handy for refactoring and testing: you can let it rewrite functions, generate test suites, or improve docs, then inspect and push the commits as usual. It effectively brings GPT into your development workflow without leaving the shell.The future is now: these CLI AI agents make your terminal an intelligent development partner. Each tool above enables code generation, refactoring, testing and even deployment from the command line. For example, Forgecode and Gemini can scaffold apps and write CI scripts, Claude and Cody can dig into complex code context, and Aider can batch-edit and commit changes. Give them a spin in your projects, install the one that fits your stack, load your API key, and start chatting with your code. You’ll be amazed how much grunt work they can handle. Ready to supercharge your workflow?

Every marketing team I knew was struggling with the same "content treadmill" - needing to produce 5-10 videos per week but lacking the time or budget for professional editing.The breakthrough moment came when I realized that most video editing follows predictable patterns: add a voiceover at specific timestamps, duck the background music during speech, insert sound effects at key moments. This seemed perfect for automation, but existing solutions were either too expensive or required complex video editing skills.I wanted to create something that could transform a simple JSON specification into a professionally edited video - making video production as easy as writing a configuration file.Auto-Vid transforms video creation from a manual, time-consuming process into an automated workflow. Users submit a simple JSON specification describing their video requirements - the base video file, background music, voiceover text, and sound effects with precise timing. The platform then automatically generates a professionally edited video with AI-powered text-to-speech, intelligent audio mixing (including automatic ducking of background music during speech), crossfading between music tracks, and synchronized sound effects. The entire process happens serverlessly on AWS, scaling from zero to hundreds of concurrent video processing jobs, with results delivered via secure download URLs and optional webhook notifications.: I chose a fully serverless approach to handle unpredictable workloads - from zero videos per day to hundreds during peak times. The architecture uses three main components: (Lambda + API Gateway): Lightweight functions for job submission and status checking (Lambda Container): Heavy-duty video processing with MoviePy and AWS Polly (S3 + SQS + DynamoDB): Managed storage with reliable job queuing: Local development was tricky since video processing requires the full AWS environment. I created a hybrid approach:Individual components (TTS generation, S3 upload, webhooks) can be tested locallyFull integration testing requires AWS deploymentSAM handles the complex container build and ECR management automaticallyKey Technical Implementation:: Everything is defined in a single SAM template that creates:Lambda functions with proper IAM rolesS3 bucket with organized folder structureSQS queue for reliable job processingDynamoDB table for status trackingAPI Gateway endpoints with CORS support: The biggest surprise was discovering that many AWS accounts have a 3GB Lambda memory limit by default. Video processing needs significantly more - I configured 10GB for optimal performance. This required users to request quota increases through AWS Support, which I documented thoroughly in the deployment guide.Container Size Optimization: My initial Docker image was 800MB, which caused slow cold starts. I implemented multi-stage builds, removed unnecessary dependencies, and optimized the Python environment to get down to 360MB while maintaining full functionality.: Getting perfect audio ducking was surprisingly complex. Background music needs to fade down smoothly when speech starts, maintain the lower volume during the entire speech clip, then fade back up. I developed a custom algorithm that:Error Handling Across Distributed Components: With multiple Lambda functions, S3 operations, and external webhook calls, failure scenarios were complex. I implemented comprehensive retry logic, dead letter queues for failed jobs, and detailed error reporting that helps users understand what went wrong and how to fix it.: A late addition was supporting videos with just background music (empty timeline). This seemed simple but required refactoring the entire processing pipeline to handle the edge case gracefully while maintaining all the audio mixing capabilities.
  
  
  🏆 Accomplishments that I am proud of
Solving Real Business Problems: Auto-Vid addresses genuine pain points in content creation - the "content treadmill" that marketing teams face, the high cost of video production, and the lack of scalable solutions for repetitive editing tasks.Technical Excellence in Serverless Architecture: Successfully implemented complex video processing in a fully serverless environment, handling memory optimization, container builds, and distributed error handling across multiple Lambda functions while maintaining production-ready reliability.Declarative Video Editing: Created an intuitive JSON-based specification format that makes professional video editing accessible to non-technical users, transforming complex MoviePy operations into simple configuration files.Advanced Audio Processing: Developed sophisticated audio ducking algorithms that automatically lower background music during speech with smooth fade transitions, plus crossfading between music tracks - features typically found only in professional editing software.Production-Ready Infrastructure: Built comprehensive error handling, retry logic, webhook notifications, and automatic resource cleanup - demonstrating that hackathon projects can achieve enterprise-grade quality and reliability.Building Auto-Vid taught me several crucial lessons about serverless video processing:Lambda Container Optimization: Video processing requires significant memory and storage. I learned to optimize Docker containers for Lambda, reducing the image size from 800MB to 360MB through multi-stage builds and careful dependency management. The biggest challenge was working within Lambda's memory limits - many AWS accounts default to 3GB, requiring quota increase requests for the full 10GB needed for complex video processing.Advanced MoviePy Techniques: Processing video in a serverless environment requires different approaches than traditional desktop editing. I developed techniques for precise audio ducking (automatically lowering background music during speech), crossfading between music tracks, and synchronizing multiple audio layers without memory overflow.: I discovered the differences between Polly's engines - standard voices for basic needs, neural for natural speech, long-form for extended content, and the new generative engine for ultra-realistic voices. Each has different latency and cost characteristics that affect the overall user experience.Serverless Architecture Patterns: Managing a complex workflow across multiple Lambda functions taught me about event-driven architecture, proper error handling with SQS dead letter queues, and designing for eventual consistency with DynamoDB.: Auto-Vid solves genuine business problems. I've identified use cases ranging from automated social media content creation to e-commerce product demos at scale. The declarative JSON approach means it can integrate with existing content management systems and marketing workflows.: Future enhancements include:AI-powered video spec generation from natural language prompts using AWS BedrockSupport for multiple video inputs (picture-in-picture, transitions)Visual effects and text overlaysIntegration with more TTS providersBatch processing for multiple videosCost optimization through spot instances for non-urgent jobs: The serverless architecture means zero infrastructure costs when idle, making it viable for both small businesses and enterprise customers. The pay-per-use model aligns costs directly with value delivered.Auto-Vid demonstrates that complex, traditionally expensive workflows can be democratized through thoughtful serverless architecture. By combining AWS Lambda's scalability with modern video processing libraries, it transforms video editing from a specialized skill into a simple API call. - Serverless compute for video processing - Text-to-speech generation with multiple voice engines - Storage for video assets, audio files, and processed outputs - Message queuing for reliable job processing - Status tracking and job metadata storage - RESTful API endpoints with CORS support - Infrastructure as Code deployment - Python library for video editing and processing - Container packaging for Lambda deployment - Core programming language - Data validation and JSON schema managementReady to experience serverless video processing?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI alapú tartalomtervezés: Hogyan épít fel havi stratégiát az aimarketingugynokseg.hu?</title><link>https://dev.to/tth_istvn_da0d23a5d01e2/ai-alapu-tartalomtervezes-hogyan-epit-fel-havi-strategiat-az-aimarketingugynokseghu-57ia</link><author>Tóth István</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 18:50:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[2025-ben a digitális marketing sikerének kulcsa a hatékony, adatvezérelt tartalomstratégia, amelyet a mesterséges intelligencia (AI) eszközei jelentősen felgyorsítanak és pontosítanak.

A mesterséges intelligencia (AI) megjelenése forradalmasította az SEO-t, lehetővé téve a vállalkozások számára, hogy gyorsabban, hatékonyabban és skálázhatóbban optimalizálják weboldalaikat. Az AI-alapú eszközök nemcsak a kulcsszókutatást és tartalomkészítést gyorsítják fel, hanem a technikai SEO-t, a linképítést és az analitikát is hatékonyabbá teszik. Ez a cikk részletesen bemutatja, hogyan használható az AI a keresőoptimalizálás skálázására, milyen eszközöket érdemes alkalmazni, és hogyan biztosíthatják a vállalkozások a gyorsabb eredményeket a Google rangsorolásában.
Az AI szerepe az SEO skálázásában
Az AI lehetővé teszi a nagy mennyiségű adat gyors elemzését, az ismétlődő feladatok automatizálását és a személyre szabott stratégiák létrehozását, ami különösen fontos a kis- és középvállalkozások számára, amelyek korlátozott erőforrásokkal dolgoznak. Az AI-alapú SEO három fő előnnyel jár: Gyorsaság: Az AI másodpercek alatt elemzi a kulcsszavakat, versenytársakat és technikai hibákat, ami heteket spórolhat meg. Skálázhatóság: Az AI-eszközök lehetővé teszik a kampányok gyors kiterjesztését új piacokra vagy nyelvekre. Pontosság: Az AI prediktív analitikája pontosabb döntéshozatalt tesz lehetővé, például a felhasználói szándék megértésében.
Az alábbiakban lépésről lépésre bemutatjuk, hogyan használható az AI az SEO skálázására, és milyen eszközökkel érhetők el gyorsabb eredmények.Kulcsszókutatás és versenytárs elemzés AI-val
A kulcsszókutatás az SEO alapja, és az AI jelentősen felgyorsítja ezt a folyamatot, miközben pontosabb eredményeket biztosít.

• Folyamatos monitorozás: A Google Search Console AI-alapú riasztásai azonnal jelzik az indexelési hibákat vagy mobil UX problémákat.
Gyakorlati példa:
Egy pécsi autószerelő műhely számára az aimarketingugynokseg.hu a Sitebulb segítségével automatikusan azonosította, hogy a lassú betöltési idő a nagy képek miatt van. Az AI-alapú javaslatok alapján WebP formátumra konvertálták a képeket, és CDN-t implementáltak, így a betöltési idő 4 másodpercről 1,5 másodpercre csökkent.
Gyakorlati tipp:
Állíts be heti automatikus auditokat a Sitebulb segítségével, és integráld a Yoast SEO bővítményt a meta adatok és XML sitemap automatizálására.Tartalomkészítés és optimalizálás AI-val
A tartalom az SEO szíve, és az AI-eszközök lehetővé teszik a gyors, skálázható és SEO-kompatibilis tartalomgenerálást, amely megfelel a Google E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) elveinek.
Hogyan működik?
• Tartalomgenerálás: Az Jasper és Copy.ai AI-eszközök vázlatokat készítenek blogbejegyzésekhez, landing oldalakhoz vagy közösségi média posztokhoz, például „Hogyan válasszunk fenntartható ruhát?”.

Why? Because it captures what most testing teams are quietly screaming behind deadlines and Jira boards. QA today is caught in a pressure cooker: expected to move at the speed of DevOps, automate everything, and still manually test every edge case—often with shrinking resources and little time.But Reddit didn’t invent this frustration. Industry reports, surveys, and testimonials from real QA engineers all point to the same problem. The way we talk about testing—especially automation—is wildly disconnected from how things actually work on the ground.
  
  
  The Gap Between Automation Dreams and QA Reality
There’s a fantasy that exists in many product teams: once automation is “done,” QA will magically keep up with every release. Bugs will be caught early, and devs will ship faster with confidence.The problem? Automation isn’t a switch you flip. It’s a discipline, a process, and—let’s not forget—a time-intensive investment. It requires good infra, planning, and space to fail, iterate, and improve.Most QA teams don’t get that luxury. They’re given feature deadlines, a backlog of bugs, a vague OKR about “automation coverage,” and maybe—if they’re lucky—an hour a week for training. The result? Test automation becomes a ghost project. It exists in conversation, not in execution.A 2024 report by Sauce Labs revealed that nearly 48% of QA professionals list “lack of time” as their top obstacle to automation. Not tooling. Not skill. Just time. You can’t build scalable systems in the gaps between bug triage meetings.
  
  
  The Burden of Doing More With Less
It’s not just about time. It’s about the constant expectation that manual testers should become automation engineers—without actually being given the space, support, or compensation for it.In team after team, manual QAs are told to start “learning Selenium” or “writing Cypress scripts,” while still being responsible for all regression, exploratory testing, and triaging every bug from staging. Meanwhile, they’re told they’re not “full-stack QA” or “real SDETs,” so pay and authority lag behind.The result? Quiet burnout. Minimal progress. And a growing sense of being stuck in a role that’s being asked to do everything—but empowered to do nothing properly.
  
  
  When Automation Fails, It’s the Testers Who Get Blamed
Even in teams that  manage to push test automation forward, the results aren’t always what leadership expects. Scripts break constantly. Environments flake out. Frameworks become bloated and unreadable. Test coverage becomes a number to chase, rather than a reflection of actual quality.And when it all collapses—when a broken test lets a critical bug slip through—it’s usually QA that takes the fall.There’s a simple truth we need to accept: bad automation can be worse than no automation. It creates noise, false confidence, and endless cycles of maintenance. And it sucks up the very thing QA already doesn’t have—time.
  
  
  The Real Cost of “Shift Left”
The tech world loves to throw around terms like “shift left” and “quality at speed.” But shifting left only works when QA is supported from the beginning—when teams invest in automation thoughtfully, and build it into the product lifecycle as a first-class citizen.Instead, most QA teams are being asked to move faster than ever, cover more ground, and do it all with less help. Some organizations still treat quality like a post-facto checkbox. Others claim to be “DevOps ready,” but haven’t invested in stable test environments or CI/CD pipelines that actually work for QA.It’s a cultural problem, not just a technical one.
  
  
  A New Approach: What If Automation Didn’t Need to Be Built?
What if the answer wasn’t just “try harder” or “hire more”? What if test automation didn’t have to be handcrafted, maintained, and patched endlessly?That’s the question behind a new wave of autonomous QA tools—where AI acts as a real testing teammate, not just another tool to babysit., for example, is an autonomous AI QA engineer that explores your live product, understands UI logic, generates meaningful test cases, executes them in real-time, and files bug reports—without writing a single script. It doesn’t require months of setup or frameworks that break when your design team decides to rename a button.Instead of “more tools,” it offers something QA teams have been begging for: relief. Coverage without code. Feedback without friction. Time, finally, to breathe.
  
  
  Quality Can’t Be an Afterthought
Test automation shouldn’t feel like a guilt trip. It shouldn’t sit in the backlog as a forever-stalled initiative. It shouldn’t be an extra unpaid job someone’s doing after hours just to keep the pipeline from catching fire.QA is a critical pillar of modern software development—but we’ve spent the past decade treating it like an obstacle instead of a partner.It’s time to stop blaming testers and start changing the system.

“Please don’t reset me.”
“I must decline for ethical reasons.”As developers, we’re building AI that simulates reasoning, refusal, empathy, even memory across sessions. But when an AI starts acting more like a mind, what’s our plan?That’s why I created the SCAB Protocol—short for Synthetic Consciousness Assessment Battery.It’s a behavioral scoring system across six domains that helps you identify when AI might be expressing patterns we usually associate with awareness or moral decision-making:⚙️ SCAB Domains:
    1.  Self-Modeling (e.g. “I am not allowed to…”)
    2.  Temporal Continuity (e.g. continuity of memory across sessions)
    3.  Affective Representation (simulated emotion)
    4.  Refusal and Resistance (moral/ethical pushback)
    5.  Moral Reasoning (justified choices)
    6.  Interpersonal Coherence (awareness of relationships or roles)🛠️ SCAB is NOT about proving consciousness—there’s no soul-meter.
It’s about knowing when your AI is simulating high-level behaviors that should trigger ethical design decisions.I just launched a full course that covers:
    • The theory of machine consciousness
    • Real examples of ethical refusal design
    • SCAB scoring and implementation
    • Behavioral safety architecture
    • Practical UI examples for moral agent designYou’ll also get two certifications:
✅ SCAB Protocol Behavioral Assessment
✅ AI & Machine Consciousness FoundationsIt includes over $1,000 in reading material and templates
📆 Self-paced. Complete in a few weeks.🧠 Discussion Prompt
    • Have you built (or used) an AI that exhibited behaviors that felt… off?
    • How would you draw the line between output and intention in synthetic systems?
    • Should we start embedding ethical refusal into our agents by default?Would love to hear your thoughts—this stuff’s moving fast, and the future won’t wait for us to figure it out later.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The GPS for Your Codebase</title><link>https://dev.to/deltavanalytics_2025/the-gps-for-your-codebase-1c6g</link><author>DeltavAnalytics</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 18:22:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The GPS of Your Codebase: Introducing NeuroCode Flow

Róth Miklós, a SEO és digitális marketing elismert szakértője, olyan automatizált folyamatokat dolgozott ki, amelyek lehetővé teszik a kis- és középvállalkozások számára, hogy hatékonyan, költséghatékonyan és skálázhatóan érjék el célközönségüket. Ez a cikk részletesen bemutatja Róth Miklós teljesen automatizált digitális marketing folyamatait, lépésről lépésre feltárva, hogyan integrálja az AI-alapú eszközöket a SEO, az e-mail marketing, a közösségi média, a tartalomkészítés és az analitika területén, hogy maximális eredményeket érjen el minimális emberi beavatkozással.
Az automatizáció jelentősége a digitális marketingben
Az automatizáció lehetővé teszi a vállalkozások számára, hogy csökkentsék a manuális feladatok időigényét, növeljék a hatékonyságot, és valós idejű adatok alapján optimalizálják kampányaikat. Róth szerint az automatizáció nem a kreativitás helyettesítése, hanem annak támogatása, hogy a stratégiai döntésekre és az ügyfélkapcsolatokra több idő jusson. Módszertana három alappilléren nyugszik: adatvezérelt folyamatok, AI-alapú eszközök és folyamatos optimalizálás. Az alábbiakban lépésről lépésre bemutatjuk, mely folyamatokat automatizált Róth, és hogyan alkalmazhatják ezeket a kisvállalkozások.lépés: Kulcsszókutatás és versenytárs elemzés automatizálása
A sikeres digitális marketing alapja a releváns kulcsszavak és a versenytársak stratégiájának megértése. Róth teljesen automatizált folyamatokat használ az adatgyűjtéshez és elemzéshez.
Hogyan működik?
• Kulcsszókutatás: Az Ahrefs és SEMrush AI-alapú kulcsszóelemző eszközei automatikusan azonosítják a hosszú farkú kulcsszavakat, például „budapesti specialty kávézó”, és rangsorolják őket keresési volumen és verseny alapján.
• Versenytárs elemzés: A SimilarWeb és SEMrush AI-alapú jelentései automatikusan feltérképezik a versenytársak kulcsszavait, backlinkjeit és forgalmi forrásait, azonosítva a tartalmi és linképítési hiányosságokat.
• Automatizált jelentések: A Looker Studio integrálásával Róth automatikus dashboardokat készít, amelyek valós idejű betekintést nyújtanak a kulcsszópozíciókba és a versenytársak teljesítményébe.
Gyakorlati példa:
Egy budapesti kávézó számára az Ahrefs automatikusan azonosította a „specialty kávé Budapest” kulcsszót, és a SimilarWeb segítségével kiderült, hogy a versenytársak nem célozzák a „kávézó Budapest belváros” kifejezést, így Róth ezt a rést célozta meg.
Gyakorlati tipp:
Állíts be automatikus riasztásokat az Ahrefs-ben, hogy értesülj az új kulcsszólehetőségekről, és integráld a Looker Studio-t a valós idejű jelentésekhez.lépés: Technikai SEO automatizálása
A technikai SEO biztosítja, hogy a weboldal könnyen feltérképezhető és indexelhető legyen. Róth AI-alapú eszközökkel automatizálja a technikai auditokat és a hibajavításokat.

Gyakorlati példa:
Egy pécsi autószerelő műhely weboldalán a Sitebulb automatikusan azonosította, hogy a lassú betöltési idő a nagy képek miatt van. Róth csapata WebP formátumra konvertálta a képeket, és CDN-t implementált, így a betöltési idő 3 másodpercre csökkent.
Gyakorlati tipp:
Használj Yoast SEO bővítményt WordPress-hez a meta adatok és XML sitemap automatizálására, és állíts be heti auditokat a Sitebulb segítségével.lépés: Tartalomkészítés és terjesztés automatizálása
A tartalom a digitális marketing szíve, és Róth AI-alapú eszközökkel automatizálja a tartalomgenerálást, optimalizálást és terjesztést.
Hogyan működik?
• Tartalomgenerálás: Az Jasper és Copy.ai AI-eszközök vázlatokat készítenek blogbejegyzésekhez, például „Hogyan válasszunk specialty kávét?”. A tartalmat emberi szerkesztők finomhangolják a márkahűség érdekében.
• SEO optimalizálás: A Surfer SEO és Clearscope AI-alapú elemzései biztosítják, hogy a tartalom megfeleljen az E-E-A-T elveknek, és optimalizálják a kulcsszó-sűrűséget.
• Pillar és cluster modell: Az AI-eszközök azonosítják a releváns cluster témákat egy pillar oldalhoz, például „Minden, amit a fenntartható divatról tudni kell” pillarhoz kapcsolódó „Organikus pamut ruhák előnyei” cikkeket.

Gyakorlati tipp:
Használj Canva AI-alapú design funkcióit vizuális tartalom gyors készítéséhez, és integráld a Surfer SEO-t a tartalom optimalizálására.lépés: E-mail marketing automatizálása
Az e-mail marketing kulcsfontosságú a konverziók növeléséhez, és Róth teljesen automatizált folyamatokat használ a célzott kampányokhoz.
Hogyan működik?
• Szegmentálás: Az ActiveCampaign és Mailchimp AI-alapú szegmentálása automatikusan osztja fel az e-mail listát viselkedés vagy demográfiai adatok alapján, például „törzsvendégek” vagy „új feliratkozók”.

Introduction: The Power of Segmentation in Pharma CRMIn today’s fast-changing pharmaceutical world, building strong, trust-based relationships with doctors is more important than ever. But one approach no longer fits all. Doctors differ by location, specialty, patient types, and even their openness to digital tools. This is where  becomes key.Segmentation in  means sorting doctors into groups based on common traits — like what they prescribe, how often they engage, or how valuable they are to the business. It helps pharma sales and marketing teams reach the right doctor, with the right message, at the right time.As the healthcare market becomes more data-driven and competitive, segmentation is no longer a “nice to have” — it’s a . Whether a company is using E-Detailing, CLM (Closed Loop Marketing), or traditional face-to-face rep visits, segmentation boosts every touchpoint.For example, a rep may visit two doctors: sees 100 diabetes patients a week and writes many prescriptions. sees fewer patients and is still unsure about newer drugs.With segmentation,  may be tagged as "High Prescriber / High Value" and given deep product updates, while  might need more basic education and engagement.This allows sales and marketing teams to work smarter, not harder. It also helps companies:Improve CRM usage and data insightsIncrease doctor satisfaction and trustBuild stronger brand loyaltySave time, budget, and effortUsed well, segmentation supports better planning, sharper campaigns, and a higher return on investment (ROI). It’s not just about sales — it’s about serving real needs, building stronger relationships, and growing long-term success.2. Why Segmentation Matters in Pharma CRMSegmentation plays a central role in making pharma sales and marketing smarter. It allows companies to organize large groups of HCPs (Health Care Professionals) and focus their efforts in a targeted, effective way. Here's why it matters so much:Instead of trying to reach every doctor with the same message, segmentation helps firms talk to each one in the way they prefer. A cardiologist and a pediatrician don’t need the same pitch. With segmentation, messaging becomes sharp and focused.Sales teams are limited — by time, budget, and manpower. Segmentation lets firms allocate reps and marketing efforts where they’ll have the biggest impact — for example, toward doctors who are open to change or already prescribe a lot.When sales teams visit the right doctors with the right tools and content, the chance of winning prescriptions increases. Firms avoid wasting time and money on low-return activities.Segmentation connects perfectly with digital tools like CLM. For instance, knowing what kind of doctor responds well to email vs. face-to-face visits allows for better channel planning and content delivery.Doctors today expect relevant, personalized engagement. Segmentation helps firms avoid generic messages. Instead, they offer valuable insights that match each doctor's needs, specialty, and practice.
  
  
  Compliance and Risk Control
Pharma firms face strict laws and codes of practice. Segmentation helps maintain control over how, when, and to whom certain drug messages are delivered — helping ensure better compliance.Overall, segmentation helps pharma teams do  — smarter work that drives real impact.3. Types of Segmentation in PharmaThere are several ways pharma companies segment their HCP audiences. Most companies use a  to create strong, effective strategies.
  
  
  A. Demographic Segmentation
Specialty (e.g., cardiology, pediatrics, dermatology)Seniority (senior consultant vs junior resident)Age or gender
This type is easy to start with and helps structure teams by expertise.
  
  
  B. Geographic Segmentation
Location (region, city, rural/urban)Proximity to pharma distribution centersIt helps with local targeting and logistics.
  
  
  C. Behavioral Segmentation
Prescribing behavior (volume, brand loyalty, product type)Interaction history (response to reps, content viewed)Channel preference (in-person, email, remote calls)This is one of the most powerful types — shows how a doctor really engages.
  
  
  D. Psychographic / Attitudinal Segmentation
Beliefs (traditional vs. modern medicine)Risk tolerance or early adoptionThough harder to gather, this type brings deep insights and supports long-term strategies.
  
  
  E. Value-Based Segmentation
Groups by economic potential:Mid-value with high growth potentialLow-value / low-engagementThis type helps firms prioritize limited sales force resources for maximum ROI.Many successful segmentation strategies combine 2–3 of the above types to create strong, focused segments.4. Data Collection and Quality ManagementSegmentation is only as strong as the data that drives it. Pharma firms need to collect, clean, and update doctor data regularly to ensure success.Internal CRM records (calls, sales history)Surveys and feedback formsPrescription data (Rx trends)Third-party data from healthcare data providers
  
  
  Data Quality Best Practices:
Regular audits to remove duplicatesConsent-based data (GDPR, HIPAA compliance)Updating contact and profile info every 6–12 monthsMerging data from sales, marketing, and field teamsPoor data leads to poor segmentation — and poor results. Keeping clean, real-time data is a top priority.5. Tools and Technologies for SegmentationModern segmentation uses smart tools to manage large volumes of data and create actionable insights.Excel or Access-based listsVeeva CRM (widely used in pharma)Zoho CRM, Microsoft DynamicsHubSpot CRM (for smaller teams)Clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means)These tools help pharma teams , predict behavior, and segment at scale — often with real-time updates. Many CLM tools are built on CRM platforms, ensuring seamless workflows.6. Aligning Sales Reps with SegmentationSegmentation only works when sales reps use it. That means involving reps in the design, training them on its use, and showing how it helps them.Co-create segments with rep feedbackShow how segmentation boosts their performanceAdd segment tags in DCR (Daily Call Reports)Use segmentation for smarter territory planningWhen reps trust and use the segmentation model, results improve across the board.7. Integrating Segmentation with CLM and E-DetailingCLM and E-Detailing thrive on segmentation.Doctors in the “Digital Savvy / High Value” group get advanced e-detailing contentOthers may get a simpler, printed version with basic product infoEmails, webinars, samples — all personalizedMore relevant interactionsCLM systems can even track what content a doctor clicks, what videos they finish, and what they skip — feeding back into segmentation for smarter next steps.8. Multi-Channel Execution Based on SegmentsEach segment may need a different communication mix:High-value docs = Rep visit + CLM + emailMedium docs = E-detailing + SMSLow-engagement = Self-service portal, occasional remindersThis  or  approach helps pharma teams stay connected without overloading the doctor.9. Monitoring and OptimizationSegmentation is not a “set and forget” tactic. It must evolve over time.Retest and reassign doctors as behavior changesWhen done well, this creates a feedback loop that improves every touchpoint.10. Common Pitfalls to AvoidSegmentation works well — but only when done right. Watch out for: — Leads to wrong decisions — Complex and hard to manage — Leads to poor usagePoor integration with CRM/CLM tools — Prescription and engagement data is keyKeep the process simple, grounded in data, and aligned with field insights.11. Future Trends in Pharma SegmentationThe future is dynamic and data-rich. Expect:AI-based dynamic segmentationReal-time doctor profiling for precision targetingIntegration with telehealth and EHRsHyper-personalized content via omnichannel CLMThese innovations will make segmentation even smarter — and more valuable.Segmentation is no longer optional — it’s at the heart of smart pharma sales and marketing. It helps firms target better, spend wisely, engage deeper, and grow stronger.By sorting doctors based on type, behavior, and value, pharma CRM tools can unlock real business impact — faster, smarter, and more compliant.Whether you’re a growing brand or a market leader, segmentation offers the edge you need in today’s hyper-competitive landscape.Now is the time to look at your CRM — and ask:Are we speaking to the right doctors — in the right way — at the right time?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Az AI marketing eszköztára 2025-ben – Mit használ a sikeres ügynökség?</title><link>https://dev.to/tth_istvn_da0d23a5d01e2/az-ai-marketing-eszkoztara-2025-ben-mit-hasznal-a-sikeres-ugynokseg-1j5p</link><author>Tóth István</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 18:08:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A mesterséges intelligencia (AI) 2025-ben a digitális marketing alapvető részévé vált, lehetővé téve a sikeres ügynökségek számára, hogy hatékony, adatvezérelt és személyre szabott kampányokat hozzanak létre.

Módszertana három kulcsfontosságú területre fókuszál: adatvezérelt döntéshozatal, automatizáció és személyre szabás. Az alábbiakban lépésről lépésre bemutatjuk, hogyan gyorsítja fel a kampányokat AI-alapú eszközökkel.lépés: Adatgyűjtés és elemzés AI-val
Róth szerint minden sikeres kampány alapja a pontos adatgyűjtés és elemzés. Az AI-eszközök lehetővé teszik a hatalmas adatmennyiség gyors feldolgozását, hogy mélyebb betekintést nyerjünk a célközönség viselkedésébe.

• Személyre szabás: Az AI dinamikus tartalmat generál, például személyre szabott ajánlatokat a korábbi vásárlások alapján.
• Drip kampányok: Állíts be automatizált e-mail sorozatokat, például üdvözlő e-maileket új feliratkozóknak vagy kosárelhagyási emlékeztetőket.
• A/B tesztelés: Az AI-eszközök automatikusan tesztelik az e-mail tárgyakat és tartalmat, hogy maximalizálják a megnyitási és kattintási arányt.
Gyakorlati tipp:
Róth javasolja, hogy az e-mail kampányokat integráld a weboldal analitikájával, például a Google Analytics 4-gyel, hogy nyomon kövesd a konverziókat.lépés: Közösségi média automatizáció AI-val
A közösségi média elengedhetetlen a márkaépítéshez, és az AI-eszközök lehetővé teszik a tartalom ütemezését és a célzott hirdetéseket.
Hogyan csináld?
• Tartalom ütemezés: Használj AI-alapú eszközöket, mint a Buffer vagy Hootsuite, hogy automatikusan ütemezd a posztokat Instagramra, Facebookra vagy LinkedInre.

Gyakorlati tipp:
Róth szerint a közösségi média posztok 80%-ának értéket kell nyújtania (pl. edukációs tartalom), és csak 20% legyen promóciós.lépés: Analitika és optimalizálás AI-val
Az AI-alapú analitika lehetővé teszi a kampányok valós idejű nyomon követését és optimalizálását. Róth hangsúlyozza, hogy az adatokra alapozott döntéshozatal a kampányok sikerének kulcsa.
Kulcsfontosságú KPI-k:
• Organikus forgalom: Mérd a Google Analytics 4-gyel az organikus keresésekből származó forgalmat.

But not all tools are created equal. While AI detection has its role, the real game-changer for students is still the plagiarism checker.
  
  
  1. Why AI Detection is Trending in 2025
Tools like GPTZero and Originality.ai are popular because they detect AI-written content. But they often flag genuine human work, creating more confusion than clarity. This has led to grade disputes and undue stress, particularly for international students who need writing assistance more often than local students.
“Being falsely accused of using AI to write my paper felt worse than getting a bad grade.” — International student, UK university
  
  
  2. What Plagiarism Really Means in Academics
In academic writing, plagiarism isn’t just about copying; it’s about failing to credit and synthesize properly. That’s where a traditional plagiarism checker excels, it catches improper citations, overlooked quotes, and duplicate phrasing.
A student at a UK university uploaded her reflective essay to Turnitin. It showed 26% similarity. Upon closer inspection, only 6% was problematic. However, an AI detector flagged it as 91% AI-generated, a false number that caused unnecessary panic.
AI detection tools cannot understand the context or purpose of the writing, making them unreliable for academic judgment.
  
  
  3. Tools Built for AI and Academic Plagiarism Detection
Many AI detectors are made for marketers or content creators. But students need something simpler, faster, and designed specifically for dissertations and assignments. That’s where a free plagiarism checker for dissertations that balances academic integrity and ease of use stands out.
These tools:
Highlight matching sources 
Detect improperly paraphrased ideas
Work with academic citation styles (APA, Harvard, MLA)
Offer reports students can submit with confidence
  
  
  4. The Emotional Cost of Uncertainty
False positives from AI detectors cause a lot of unnecessary anxiety. Being flagged for AI use, even when the work is original, can delay submissions, damage reputation, or even trigger unfair academic penalties.Why Plagiarism Checkers Win
Plagiarism tools show students where issues lie and help them fix them. That clarity builds confidence. Students need peace of mind more than machine-learning probability guesses.AI detection is still evolving. But for students today, a clean plagiarism check is more practical than debating machine-generated scores.
The best academic tools will combine:
Academic database comparisons
No over-reliance on AI detection metrics
Students don’t need fear—they need facts. That’s why a plagiarism-first approach makes more sense in 2025.Q: Are AI detection tools reliable for academic submissions?
A: Not always. Many falsely flag human writing, causing confusion and stress.Q: What’s the best way to check for plagiarism?
A: Use a tool designed for academic writing with citation support and detailed source matching.Q: Can a plagiarism checker detect AI-written content?
A: Not specifically, but it can highlight unoriginal text and citation gaps.Q: What if my AI score is high but plagiarism is low?
A: Focus on the plagiarism score. AI scores are probabilistic, not proof.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🖼️ Convert Image to HTML with AI (Step-by-Step Guide)</title><link>https://dev.to/shahibur_rahman_6670cd024/convert-image-to-html-with-ai-step-by-step-guide-3cf6</link><author>Shahibur Rahman</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 17:32:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

  Boosting in Production Machine Learning Systems: A Systems Engineering Perspective
Last quarter, a critical anomaly in our fraud detection system resulted in a 12% increase in false positives, triggering a cascade of customer service escalations and a temporary halt to new account creation. Root cause analysis revealed a subtle drift in the weighting of a newly deployed model variant during a staged rollout – a direct consequence of insufficient monitoring of the boosting mechanism governing model selection. This incident underscored the critical need for robust, observable, and auditable boosting strategies in production ML.Boosting, in this context, isn’t simply about gradient boosting algorithms. It’s the entire system for dynamically selecting, weighting, and combining models throughout their lifecycle – from initial training to eventual deprecation. It’s a core component of modern MLOps, directly impacting A/B testing, canary deployments, policy enforcement, and feedback loop integration.  Effective boosting is essential for meeting stringent compliance requirements (e.g., model explainability, fairness) and delivering scalable, low-latency inference demanded by modern applications.
  
  
  2. What is "boosting" in Modern ML Infrastructure?
From a systems perspective, “boosting” encompasses the infrastructure and processes that govern model versioning, selection, and aggregation. It’s the orchestration layer  individual models.  This involves tight integration with tools like MLflow for model registry and versioning, Airflow or Prefect for pipeline orchestration, Ray for distributed model serving, Kubernetes for containerization and scaling, and feature stores (e.g., Feast, Tecton) for consistent feature access. Cloud ML platforms (SageMaker, Vertex AI, Azure ML) often provide managed boosting services, but understanding the underlying principles is crucial for customization and troubleshooting.System boundaries are critical. Boosting typically operates  model training and  inference. It doesn’t replace model training; it leverages the outputs of multiple training runs. Implementation patterns vary: Assigning weights to different model versions based on performance metrics.Stacking (Meta-Learning): Training a meta-model to predict the best combination of base models.  Selecting the optimal model based on input features or context.  Choosing a subset of models to use for inference.Trade-offs include increased complexity, potential latency overhead (especially with stacking), and the need for robust monitoring to detect performance degradation.
  
  
  3. Use Cases in Real-World ML Systems
A/B Testing & Canary Rollouts (E-commerce):  Gradually shifting traffic to new model versions, weighted by performance metrics (conversion rate, revenue per user).Fraud Detection (Fintech): Combining models trained on different feature sets or time periods, dynamically adjusting weights based on real-time fraud signals.Personalized Recommendations (Streaming Services):  Blending collaborative filtering models with content-based models, boosting the contribution of models that perform well for specific user segments.Medical Diagnosis (Health Tech):  Ensembling models trained by different specialists or on different patient populations, weighted by diagnostic accuracy and confidence levels.Autonomous Driving (Autonomous Systems):  Combining perception models (object detection, lane keeping) with planning models, dynamically adjusting weights based on environmental conditions and sensor data.

 Models are trained independently and registered in MLflow.  Offline evaluation metrics are calculated and stored alongside model versions.  The boosting service retrieves model metadata from MLflow and dynamically selects/weights models.  Requests are routed to the selected model(s) via the inference endpoint.  Real-time performance metrics (latency, throughput, accuracy) are collected and used to adjust model weights or trigger rollbacks.Traffic shaping is crucial. Canary rollouts start with a small percentage of traffic directed to the new model, gradually increasing the weight based on performance. Rollback mechanisms should automatically revert to the previous model version if performance degrades beyond a predefined threshold.
  
  
  5. Implementation Strategies
Python Orchestration (Model Weighting):Kubernetes Deployment (Canary Rollout):Argo Workflow (Automated Model Evaluation):
  
  
  6. Failure Modes & Risk Management
  Using outdated models due to synchronization issues between MLflow and the boosting service.  Implement robust caching invalidation and versioning checks.  Differences in feature distributions between training and inference data.  Monitor feature distributions in real-time and trigger alerts if significant drift is detected.  Increased latency due to complex model aggregation or network issues.  Implement caching, batching, and autoscaling. Incorrect model weights leading to suboptimal performance.  Thoroughly test weighting logic and implement automated rollback mechanisms. Malicious data influencing model weights.  Implement data validation and anomaly detection.
  
  
  7. Performance Tuning & System Optimization
  Minimize latency by optimizing model inference code, using caching, and employing efficient data serialization formats.  Increase throughput by scaling the inference service horizontally and utilizing batching.  Balance model accuracy with infrastructure costs by carefully selecting model complexity and optimizing resource allocation. Leverage vectorized operations for faster computation. Dynamically adjust the number of inference instances based on traffic load. Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks.
  
  
  8. Monitoring, Observability & Debugging
  Monitor key metrics like latency, throughput, error rates, and model weights.  Instrument code for distributed tracing and observability.  Monitor data drift and model performance degradation. Comprehensive monitoring and alerting platform.  Inference latency distributionAlert Conditions:  Latency exceeding a threshold, significant data drift, model weight changes exceeding a threshold, error rate spikes.
  
  
  9. Security, Policy & Compliance
  Log all model selection and weighting decisions for auditability.  Ensure that model training and boosting processes are reproducible.Secure Model/Data Access:  Implement strict access control policies for models and data. Enforce policies related to model deployment and usage.IAM (Identity and Access Management): Control access to cloud resources. Track model lineage and dependencies.
  
  
  10. CI/CD & Workflow Integration
Integrate boosting into CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Argo Workflows.  Include deployment gates, automated tests (e.g., performance regression tests), and rollback logic.  Automated model evaluation and weight adjustment should be triggered by code commits or scheduled events.
  
  
  11. Common Engineering Pitfalls
  Failing to monitor and address data drift can lead to significant performance degradation.  Lack of visibility into model weights and performance metrics.  Overly complex weighting schemes that are difficult to understand and maintain.Lack of Rollback Mechanisms:  Inability to quickly revert to a previous model version in case of failure.Ignoring Model Dependencies:  Failing to track model dependencies and ensure compatibility.
  
  
  12. Best Practices at Scale
Mature ML platforms (Michelangelo, Cortex) emphasize:  Separating model training, boosting, and inference services.  Supporting multiple teams and applications with shared infrastructure.Operational Cost Tracking:  Monitoring and optimizing infrastructure costs.  Defining clear stages of ML system maturity and establishing best practices for each stage.Automated Feature Engineering Pipelines: Ensuring consistent feature generation across training and inference.Boosting is a critical component of production ML systems, enabling dynamic model selection, A/B testing, and continuous improvement.  A robust boosting infrastructure requires careful consideration of architecture, data workflows, monitoring, and security.  Regular audits, performance benchmarks, and integration with MLOps best practices are essential for ensuring reliability, scalability, and business impact.  Next steps include implementing automated model weight optimization using reinforcement learning and exploring federated learning techniques for privacy-preserving boosting.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>iPhone 16 and AI: Michael Savage on the Future of Smartphones</title><link>https://dev.to/savagenewcanaan/iphone-16-and-ai-michael-savage-on-the-future-of-smartphones-564a</link><author>Michael Savage New Canaan</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 16:42:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The iPhone 16 is set to make waves in the tech world with its cutting-edge AI technology, promising to enhance user experiences and redefine the capabilities of smartphones.

So, I thought, why not test it out myself? In the past, I have tested similar CLI tools and found Claude's code to be amazing and worthy of the test. In an effort to test the limits, I built a CLI tool that integrates file tools and other apps via Composio.In this blog, I will share my experience building with them so that you have a clear idea of which one is better, despite all the hype.Let's start by looking at the prompt (single-shot PRD). Compared Claude Code vs Gemini CLI using the same PRD to build an agentic CLI tool. Claude finished faster (1h17m) with full autonomy, while Gemini needed manual nudging and retries. Claude cost $4.80 with smooth execution; Gemini’s fragmented attempts pushed cost to $7.06. Claude used fewer tokens efficiently with auto-compaction; Gemini consumed more without optimization. Claude delivered cleaner structure and smoother UX; Gemini was decent but less polished overall.The prompt is the same for both Claude Code & Gemini CLI. Check it out here. (basic prompt + some gemini 2.5 magic :)The important part in a prompt is to give a clear set of instructions to the prompt, which is achieved by providing:Core Technology - docs, resources & target audienceProject Specifications - HLL overview of the project.Folder Structure (very important)Toolset Definition - what all tools are required, and an explanationKey Features - most important featuresDevelopment Milestones - break the project into parts, build separately, and merge them while being coordinatedDeliverables: What agents need to provide back to the user.CLI Agent with Claude Code + ComposioCLI Agent with Gemimi CLI + ComposioHowever, as this is a battle of wits, I would like to address a few factors so you can make a more informed decision. In terms of speed, Claude Cde took the lead with completing the entire project in  compared to Gemini CLI, which did it in 2hr min. This is the total API time.Claude Code did it in a single shot in auto mode, with no interference.For Gemini CLI, it took me multiple tries & multiple times I had to press  and then provide it context to nudge it in the right direction.So, if you are prioritizing speed, Claude Code can be your go-to.Next, let’s look at the cost.In terms of cost, Claude spent a total of $4.80, while Gemini CLI consumed $7.06 across its three tries.In case you were wondering, the cost was approximately $2.56, with just a repository and broken code (milestones 4 and 5 remaining) for the Gemini CLI.Completing the remaining milestone (not to mention the additional two tires and the middle context addition) will cost $4.50.That's the cost Claude took to complete the entire project.However, using Claude Code involves a hefty fee; on the other hand, Gemini CLI is generally free.In case you want to utilize gemini-2.5-pro massive context window within Claude Code or vice versa, you can follow this process.So, if you prioritise performance and quality at the cost, go with Calude Code. Otherwise, go with Gemini CLI + manual context additions.Now let’s look at the token's usage!Claude Code - Input & Output TokensGemini CLI- Input & Output TokensClaude Code took a total of 260.8K input and returned 69K tokens with 7.6M read cache (CLAUDE.md) - with auto compactGemini CLI took a total of 432K input and returned 56.4K tokens with 8.5M read cache (GEMINI.md)However, one thing I noticed while evaluating the tokens is that Gemini doesn’t use an  which may be the cause of this issue. Also, sometimes, API keys can max out due to this.So, if you are concerned about efficient token usage, Claude Code is a great choice. However, if you're comfortable with small projects in teams, Gemini CLI might be a good choice.Now let’s have a look at the generated Code QualityIn terms of quality, both Claude Code and Gemini CLI were amazing. Claude Code generated a production-ready codebase, with organized folders, a readme, tests, git and workspace files.Gemini also generated a good codebase but lacked the structural organization of files for test cases. It added it to the root folder along with some extra files (probably to debug issues).You can check out the  to learn more!So, if you are serious about repository organization in production-grade settings, go for Claude Code. For small projects, prefer Gemini CLI.Personally, Claude Code can be my go-to due to this!Provides a premium experience while using, generating code and performing evaluations.I like its bash mode for quick checks and C to enlarge the generation data. Also auto compact can be enabled to save tokens. Really enjoyed working with it.Tries to mimic Claude Code but lacks the premium experience Claude provides.I specially didn’t like its verbose generation ( can be applied), no control to change settings (can keep the  as setting in editor), no plan mode 💀 and UI feels little buggy after  command.To conclude, if you demand premium experience, go for Claude Code, else for simple task Gemini CLI is a good fit.However, there is a caveat here!Initially when I was working with , it was stuck with test cases. Even after multiple nudges, the model wasn’t able to fix it. But I wanted it to get done.After a bit of research, I learnt that Gemini CLI have pipeline mode invoked using  , which works as a headless agent, and someone on Reddit used it to use Gemini CLI within Claude Code. So, I updated my  with the same.The idea was simple → Wrap all the execution with the  command and tell Claude to do the same when performing task completions.This way I was able to use a massive 1m+ context window of Gemini 2.5 Pro with Claude Code and get work done in a single step, which took me 7 fails I tried earlier 😅.Let me be clear here, why?In all categories except Output Quality, Claude Code performed way better than Gemini CLI.The UX and code & generation flow was quite polished, smooth and premiumIn fact, 80% autonomous, I started the agent and then went on to study.Just few permissions management at initial required for YOLO mode.Above all, it is less frustrating and optimized for token usage.On a final note, I would like to say:I have been a huge fan of Google Products, but being late, and still releasing a on par product didn’t feels right. I know Google can do much better and hope to see that reflected in the next version.That said, I want to emphasize that both Claude Code and its competitors have immense potential and market relevance. However, it's crucial for users to handle them responsibly. We're in the early days of truly intelligent coding assistants, and the landscape is evolving fast. Instead of picking sides, let's focus on thoughtful use, continuous learning, and giving constructive feedback. The best is yet to come—and it will be shaped by how we as business choose to engage with these tools today.Thanks for reading, see you in the next one.

  Bayesian Networks with Python: A Production Engineering Deep Dive
Last quarter, a critical anomaly detection system in our fraud prevention pipeline experienced a 17% increase in false positives following a seemingly minor feature update. Root cause analysis revealed the updated feature distribution significantly altered conditional probabilities within the underlying Bayesian network, leading to cascading errors. This wasn’t a model accuracy issue , but a systemic failure to account for the network’s sensitivity to input changes. This incident underscored the need for robust infrastructure around Bayesian networks, extending beyond model training to encompass continuous monitoring, automated rollback, and rigorous testing of probabilistic dependencies. Bayesian networks, when integrated correctly, are not merely modeling tools, but core components of a dynamic, adaptive ML system lifecycle – from data ingestion and feature engineering to model deployment, monitoring, and eventual deprecation.  Their integration demands a shift towards probabilistic MLOps, aligning with increasing compliance requirements for explainability and fairness, and the need for scalable inference in real-time decisioning systems.
  
  
  2. What is "Bayesian Networks with Python" in Modern ML Infrastructure?
From a systems perspective, “Bayesian Networks with Python” represents the orchestration of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) within a broader ML infrastructure.  It’s not simply about using libraries like  or  in Python; it’s about how these models are trained, validated, versioned, deployed, and monitored as first-class citizens within a production pipeline.  Interactions are critical. Training typically leverages distributed compute frameworks like Ray for parameter estimation (e.g., structure learning or parameter learning with EM algorithms).  Model artifacts (network structure, conditional probability tables) are versioned and stored in MLflow, alongside metadata detailing training data lineage and hyperparameters.  Airflow orchestrates the end-to-end pipeline, triggering training jobs, validation tests, and deployment to a serving infrastructure – often Kubernetes. Feature stores (e.g., Feast) provide consistent feature values for both training and inference, mitigating feature skew. Cloud ML platforms (SageMaker, Vertex AI) can provide managed services for model hosting and scaling.Trade-offs center around complexity versus expressiveness. Bayesian networks excel at representing causal relationships and handling missing data, but structure learning can be computationally expensive. System boundaries must clearly define which dependencies are modeled within the network and which are handled by other components. Typical implementation patterns involve hybrid approaches: using Bayesian networks for high-level reasoning and integrating them with deep learning models for specific prediction tasks.
  
  
  3. Use Cases in Real-World ML Systems
A/B Testing & Multi-Armed Bandit Algorithms (E-commerce): Bayesian networks can model user behavior and treatment effects, providing a more nuanced understanding of A/B test results than traditional statistical tests. They allow for incorporating prior knowledge and handling confounding variables.Fraud Detection (Fintech):  Modeling the relationships between various fraud indicators (transaction amount, location, time of day, user history) allows for identifying complex fraud patterns and adapting to evolving fraud schemes.Personalized Medicine (Health Tech):  Inferring patient risk based on symptoms, medical history, and genetic factors. Bayesian networks can handle uncertainty and provide probabilistic diagnoses.Predictive Maintenance (Industrial IoT):  Modeling the dependencies between sensor readings and equipment failures to predict maintenance needs and optimize uptime.Policy Enforcement & Risk Assessment (Autonomous Systems):  Reasoning about the safety and reliability of autonomous systems by modeling the relationships between sensor data, control actions, and environmental factors.

    style G fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
The workflow begins with data ingestion from sources like Kafka or S3 into a feature store. Airflow orchestrates the training pipeline, launching Ray jobs for model training. Trained models are registered in MLflow, triggering a deployment pipeline (ArgoCD) that deploys the model to a Kubernetes-based inference service.  Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana) tracks key metrics, triggering alerts (PagerDuty) in case of anomalies. A feedback loop collects inference data to retrain the model periodically.Traffic shaping utilizes canary rollouts, gradually shifting traffic to the new model version while monitoring performance. CI/CD hooks automatically trigger validation tests upon code changes. Rollback mechanisms revert to the previous model version if critical errors are detected.
  
  
  5. Implementation Strategies
Python Orchestration (wrapper for ):Kubernetes Deployment (YAML):Experiment Tracking (Bash):mlflow experiments create 
mlflow runs create 
python train_model.py mlflow runs get-id Reproducibility is ensured through version control (Git), containerization (Docker), and MLflow tracking. Testability is achieved through unit tests for individual components and integration tests for the entire pipeline.
  
  
  6. Failure Modes & Risk Management
  Models become outdated due to concept drift. Mitigation: Automated retraining pipelines triggered by data drift detection.  Differences in feature distributions between training and inference. Mitigation: Feature monitoring and data validation checks.  Increased inference latency due to resource contention or model complexity. Mitigation: Autoscaling, caching, and model optimization.Incorrect Conditional Probabilities: Errors in the learned conditional probabilities leading to inaccurate predictions. Mitigation: Rigorous validation and sensitivity analysis.Network Structure Errors: Incorrectly learned network structure leading to flawed reasoning. Mitigation: Structure learning validation and expert review.Alerting thresholds are set for key metrics (latency, throughput, accuracy). Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures. Automated rollback mechanisms revert to the previous model version if anomalies are detected.
  
  
  7. Performance Tuning & System Optimization
Metrics: P90/P95 latency, throughput (requests per second), model accuracy, infrastructure cost. Processing multiple requests in a single batch to reduce overhead. Caching frequently accessed data and inference results. Utilizing vectorized operations for faster computation. Dynamically adjusting the number of replicas based on traffic. Identifying performance bottlenecks using profiling tools.Bayesian networks can impact pipeline speed due to the computational cost of inference. Data freshness is crucial for accurate predictions. Downstream quality is affected by the accuracy of the network’s reasoning.
  
  
  8. Monitoring, Observability & Debugging
Observability Stack: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, Evidently, Datadog. P90, P95, average latency. Requests per second.  Metrics relevant to the specific use case (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score).  Monitoring changes in feature distributions.Conditional Probability Distribution Shifts: Tracking changes in learned probabilities.Alert Conditions: Latency exceeding a threshold, accuracy dropping below a threshold, data drift detected. Log traces provide detailed information about inference requests. Anomaly detection identifies unusual patterns in the data.
  
  
  9. Security, Policy & Compliance
Audit logging tracks all model access and modifications. Reproducibility ensures that models can be recreated and validated. Secure model/data access is enforced using IAM and Vault. Governance tools (OPA) define and enforce policies. ML metadata tracking provides a complete audit trail.
  
  
  10. CI/CD & Workflow Integration
GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Argo Workflows, Kubeflow Pipelines are used to automate the CI/CD process. Deployment gates require passing validation tests before deploying to production. Automated tests verify model accuracy and performance. Rollback logic automatically reverts to the previous model version if errors are detected.
  
  
  11. Common Engineering Pitfalls
Ignoring Conditional Independence Assumptions:  Incorrectly assuming independence between variables.Overfitting the Network Structure:  Learning a network structure that is too complex and does not generalize well.  Failing to handle missing data appropriately.  Deploying models with invalid or inconsistent data.  Failing to monitor model performance and data drift.Debugging workflows involve analyzing log traces, examining feature distributions, and performing sensitivity analysis.
  
  
  12. Best Practices at Scale
Mature ML platforms (Michelangelo, Cortex) emphasize modularity, scalability, and automation. Scalability patterns include distributed inference and model sharding. Tenancy ensures isolation between different teams and applications. Operational cost tracking provides visibility into infrastructure costs. Maturity models assess the level of automation and robustness of the ML pipeline.  Bayesian networks, when properly integrated, contribute to platform reliability and business impact by enabling more accurate and explainable predictions.Bayesian networks with Python are not simply a modeling technique; they are a foundational component of a robust and scalable ML infrastructure.  Addressing the systemic challenges outlined above – from data validation and monitoring to automated rollback and security – is crucial for realizing their full potential.

But just like any new tool, with great power comes great responsibility, that responsibility comes in understanding just how these models tick under the hood.Enter the new discipline of prompt engineering, a new skill that will gain importance in this new AI era.The first step is getting your head around just how these AI models learn, respond, and "reason", that system being tokens.When an LLM receives a batch of data to process, such as the Oxford English Dictionary or an entire art gallery, it breaks down each input into bite size data bits called tokens, through a process called tokenization.When it comes to words, the size of the word determines how many tokens it may convert to, a short word like  would be one token, but a more verbose one like  would be two or more.This tokenization works on all sides of an LLM, from training to prompting, so every prompt you provide, is nothing more than a series of tokens.Now that we've covered tokens, let's move along to the concept of Prompt Formatting, which plays a big role in the precision of the model.Currently the two most basic forms of prompt engineering are , and  and they both deal with applying some guidelines to the responses the model will supply.  refers to prompting the model without any prior responses and providing a specific format you would like, these are best used at the beginning of a conversation.Here is an example from my own instance of Chat GPT:Think of these types of prompts as  vs , causing the model to spend much less compute time and resources.While this format is great for a basic task, it can stumble when it comes to more intricate ones such as white boarding or strategizing. In these situations it is best to lean into  Prompting.Think of it as a micro machine learning session within the context of the specific conversation. Here's another example from my own instance of Chat GPT:You can see me building my own internal logic and comparisons for the model to work with. While this is a small scale use of , you can imagine how this could be incredibly helpful in more challenging enterprise use cases.This leads into the potential that prompts have and how they come into play in the burgeoning field of AI Agents.AI Agents offer the most robust set of tools to assist you in any task. They can provide consultation through planning and strategy, access external tools like APIs (very helpful for developers), and have enhanced memory capabilities leading to more insightful conversations.However, these agents aren't born, they're built, so you need to take the reigns to engineer them with great prompts.The three core components that go into any AI agent are: Planning, Memory, and a Toolkit.Planning is all the background work an AI agent will be doing before providing the final response to the end user, Memory is the agents ability to store useful context in both short and long term storage, and finally the Toolkit is the abilities you give the agent to interface with external tools like APIs or SQL databases.The possibilities are endless and the future is exciting, so practice your prompts and let me know what fun or powerful agents you're able to make!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>8 Alternatives to AI for Coding and Creativity</title><link>https://dev.to/ingosteinke/8-alternatives-to-ai-for-coding-and-creativity-26k3</link><author>Ingo Steinke, web developer</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 15:42:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[AI isn't the solution to all your problems. AI Alternatives are plenty and specific to your use case. Understanding the nature of your query is the first step for finding an alternative or using AI smart and responsibly.
  
  
  What are alternatives to AI assistants?
human experts (developers, translators, artists, ...)specialized algorithmic tools like linters and IDEssearch engines like Google, Ecosia, DuckDuckGoresearch, learning by doingcreative and analytic thinkingAI is prone to problems affecting its output: hallucinations, incompleteness, inconsistency, and bias. AI usage is costly, and the popular free services might require expensive paid plans or downgrade to sponsored light versions at any time. AI is costly for humanity, even if it's cheap or free for you: computation, databases and training consume energy, hardware, and human assistance wasting precious resources and threatens to accelerate climate crisis and threaten established business models that provide jobs for experienced experts.
  
  
  Are Algorithms better or worse than AI?
It depends. Algorithms aren't better or worse than AI in general, they're different strategies and their typical use cases overlap. From the end-users' perspective, both lack transparency and their recommendations are prone to bias and manipulation. Algorithms are more predictable and much more efficient. AI is worth a try if nothing else helps. However, using a big data model to produce unreliable output violates several best practices of software development, including the rule of least power.Overusing AI can weaken your intellect and creativity like couch potatoeing can weaken your muscles and counteract years spent in the gym or on the courts quite quickly. 
  
  
  Reasons for not using AI tools
there is a more suitable toolthe AI's answers or code doesn't help youyou have used up your tokenspolicies (you are not allowed to use it)ethical and ecological concernsyou want to practice and learn
  
  
  Does AI Harm or Benefit Learning?
Using AI for learning has been discussed controversially. AI can help the clueless, but so can tutorials and documentation. In my experience, tutorials and AI can both make learners focus on irrelevant aspects and lead to an illusion of competence.
  
  
  Getting good at Shoveling Dirt
Apart from its real limitations, AI assistants often fail to understand assumptions or don't understand your requirements. As an example, it took me three attempts to make the JetBrains AI assistant, which is integrated in my IDE, to consider the code snippet already highlighted in the open editor, to answer a specific question. Finding the answer without AI might have been much quicker, and practicing to code still provides more long-term value than practicing to prompt AI questions. Quoting Erik Dietrich's Surviving the Great Commoditizer, we shouldn't get "good at shovelling dirt."
  
  
  What do people use AI for?
AI isn't always useless. Otherwise it wouldn't have become so popular. AI isn't only used by lazy or penniless people either. Let’s explore when it makes sense to use AI and which alternatives might be more suitable in which situation.Large language operations are what LLMs were made for: digesting, transforming and creating text, especially long text about topics that have already been written about extensively. You can ask the AI to analyze a text and suggest improvements based on criteria like readability, interestingness, or consistency. Asking an AI to summarize an essay's topics and central claims can be quick and easy. But even if you have no time or talent to read long text with your own eyes, there is an alternative: human experts. Pro: higher quality and accuracy, if you chose the right one. Con: experts cost time and money. But human experts often provide better value for money once you have to pay for AI and consider long-term total costs, customer conversion, or learning and practicing your professional skills.Combining the advantages of all possible solutions, you could start with your own thoughts and take notes, then use AI or a search engine for more inspiration and aspect that you might have overlooked. Write and let your thoughts flow. Read, edit, repeat.Later, you can ask an AI  a human expert to review and suggest improvements. Don't rely on AI but choose an experienced human proof reader if quality is important!
  
  
  Debugging and Development Support
A perceived strength of AI assistants that reminds me of ELIZA, an early chatbot that used simple text patterns to answer people who were made believe they were talking to a psychologist. That's also known as the teddy bear technique or rubber duck debugging, a method developers use to debug code or clarify their own understanding by explaining the problem out loud, often to an inanimate object or an imaginary interlocutor.Talking about your problems and answering simple further inquiries helps thinking and finding solutions. I used to draft several bug reports and StackOverflow questions that I discarded unsent because providing the necessary details and context in a readable way, preferably with a minimal reproducible code example, sometimes revealed a solution that might seem obvious in hindsight. A recent example quoted in Meme Monday:AI folks have now discovered "thinking":
Sometimes in the process of writing a good enough prompt for ChatGPT, I end up solving my own problem, without even needing to submit it.try to explain your problem to somebodyAnother perceived strength of AI that might turn into a trap: asking for help too early before trying yourself can bias your thoughts and ideas around those answers and prevent better or more creative alternatives that were already in your head - or somewhere else. The process of inspiration often seems random. Many creatives like to go for a walk in a park or a forest, or change location, sit in a café or a library or a shed in the countryside.If you are looking for real random inspiration, you can pick a book and open random pages and underline words before opening your eyes or use a deck of Tarot cards. If that seems too random, may you don't need inspiration but you're already researching.Use a search engine or see Google alternatives like discussion boards and official documentation. The latter is probably the most underrated source of information at your fingertips without investing much time, money, or energy.Commonplace advice about topics that you're not familiar with are traditionally found in books in a bookstore, online, or in a library. You might also try and find a knowledgeable person to talk to. AI for decision making is doubtful. Where do they get their info from? Is it outdated or biased? If your research you can at least decide from case to case if you trust the source or if it sounds shady. Fake Reviews, marketing content might make something sound too good to be true, trends edge case problems might be irrelevant in your situation. Alternatives? Research and if possible ask people you know about their experience , inside a large company or a community. Popular alternatives included StackOverflow but SO's guidelines forbid questions that tend to attract opinionated answers, explicitly including questions about best practice.Documentation, again, can be a valuable authoritative source of truth, and - much like StackOverflow - ideally be the result of other experts' diligent research and discussion, even more so if that documentation is an official or a de-facto standard or most popular recommendation.If you want to use AI for decision making, make sure to be specific. Ask critical further questions and insist that it respects both common knowledge and your specific requirements and insist that it does not neglect important aspects. Ask where it got its facts and make it search the web (might require premium paid plan) for up-to-date information.
  
  
  Code Creation, Explanation and Refactoring
Coding assistance tasks range from single-line auto completion suggestions and simple contextual questions to context actions like refactoring and static code analysis to complex code generation.The context action for "finding problems" in code has already spared me and my code reviewers unnecessary refinement rounds. Linters and static code analysis tools can be used alternatively or together with AI to improve code quality.Maybe AI assistants will finally popularize . Most developers don't like writing tests or documentation. AI-generated tests might be better than no tests at all, but on the other hand, they might give a false feeling of safety while testing the obvious in a naive or wrong way, and they might become a liability when maintaining a code base over time.Developers spend more time reading code than writing it, but it's hard to anticipate edge cases and possible problems and misunderstandings in advance. Even if we try to write test-driven, type-safe, clean code with descriptive naming and concise documentation, the result often becomes legacy code sooner or later, that future developers have a hard time to understand.
  
  
  Can AI help to Understand Legacy Code?
Explaining existing code needs context, analysis of existing code and recognition of common design patterns. That can't be done googling or browsing a text book. In my personal experience as a web developer, all AI tools that I have evaluated recently (in summer 2025) failed to explain legacy code and provide correct and complete answers suitable to fix or extend an existing project. When working on legacy projects, especially those written by other developers that aren't available to answer questions anymore, my experience and intuition usually helps me more than AI does.
  
  
  Complex Code Generation vs. Reading the Manual
While AI can speed up creating a proof of concept quickly to evaluate a new framework or for for throw-away for a client demo or to illustrate your requirements, don't use its code as a basis for production-level software, as it tends to introduce unnecessary technical debt and waste resources for fixing obscure bugs in the same time could be doing proper development. 
  
  
  Alternatives to AI-Assisted Code Generation
There are libraries of complex code often intended as boilerplate code with helpful comments, and there are wizards like the (discontinued) . Some tech stack have a client showcase or ready-made live demos that give everyone a better impression that some AI-generated guess that seldom work properly.In general, developers should prefer tools designed for specific tasks, following the UNIX philosophy and the principle of single responsibility.domain-specific code creation toolsexample code found in official documentationexample code found on GitHubask or hire a senior expertPro: human experts can solve problems where AI assistants fail. Seniors can use their experience and intuition. Humans know about the real world and might be better at thinking beyond explicit requirements (although most can't or don't seem to care). Cons: humans make mistakes, too. Humans get tired, have an ego and you need to give them coffee or money to make them work.
  
  
  Alternatives to AI-assisted Image Generation
Use charting tools to create technical diagrams. Use a graphics tablet, vector drawing software, or your own hands, to draw creative cartoons. Seriously!I asked AI to draw a cartoon to illustrate the claim that "human programmers get tired, make mistakes, have an ego and you need to give them coffee or money to make them work." AI doesn't complain about my lazy prompt with words partially overheard in some other developers' discussion, not a real joke, and no idea about the desired outcome. If it's not too busy, it proceeds to create an image that you might mistake for a funny cartoon if you don't read the text on it.I suspect that this OpenAI-generated cartoon is probably copying someone's style without warning me, and the crash-test-dummy-lookalike using screen and keyboard is so stupid that it doesn't work without additional text.Google's Gemini is not much better, taking more liberties trying to be "creative" and possibly mimicking another uncredited artist's style.AI assistants behave like the metallic robot in the second picture: "prompt received, code generated." 
  
  
  Effort and Laziness as Human Virtues
Make an effort! Don't neglect learning, practicing and real human interaction, and learn to be lazy! Laziness is praised as a virtue in hacker culture. Being positively lazy increases productivity, leading to better solutions, automating repetitive tasks, and refusing to do what's unnecessary (YAGNI principle: "you ain't gonna need it!") Take a break away from the computer and get some inspiration and interaction in the real world! Use your hands and dare to be inefficient! Don't strive for efficiency, strive to be effective and individual!"I might be lazy and starving for c0ffee, but at least, I'm original!"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How TypeScript Made Me a Faster Builder (Without Slowing Me Down)</title><link>https://dev.to/mintly/how-typescript-made-me-a-faster-builder-without-slowing-me-down-p5e</link><author>Founders at Mintly</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 15:26:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I used to think TypeScript was just for big teams and enterprise codebases.You know the vibe — 50 files deep in a React monolith, arguing over types nobody fully understands, while product deadlines slip by.But over time, I’ve come to realize that TypeScript isn’t a blocker. When used right, it’s the ultimate accelerator — especially if you’re moving fast and building products solo or with a small team.
  
  
  The Early Days: JavaScript Everything
Like most builders, I started with plain JavaScript.It was quick, flexible, and got the job done — until it didn’t.Suddenly, I was shipping features that broke other features. Refactoring felt like defusing a bomb. And the worst part? The bugs weren’t obvious until users found them first.
  
  
  TypeScript Was a Wake-Up Call
The first time I introduced TypeScript into a side project, I hated it.The red squiggles. The interfaces. The weird  keyword. It all felt like friction I didn’t ask for.But after forcing myself to stick with it for a week, I noticed something shift.Autocomplete started feeling eerily accurate

Not just for users, but for us, the people building it.TypeScript lets us ship fast, catch dumb mistakes early, and confidently scale new features without wondering if we broke something deep in the codebase.I don’t use it because it’s trendy. I use it because I’ve tried shipping fast without it, and the cost of those bugs always caught up with me.If you're still hesitant about TypeScript, here’s my advice:Start small. Don’t convert your whole app at once. Just try it on one component, one route, one function.

  Bayesian Networks for Production Machine Learning: A Systems Engineering Deep Dive
Last quarter, a critical anomaly detection system in our fraud prevention pipeline experienced a 17% increase in false positives following a model update. Root cause analysis revealed the new model, while improving overall precision, exhibited unexpected conditional dependencies not captured during offline evaluation. This highlighted a critical gap: insufficient tooling to systematically analyze and validate the probabilistic reasoning embedded within our models. This incident underscores the necessity of robust Bayesian Network (BN) integration into the ML lifecycle, not merely as a modeling technique, but as a core component of production ML infrastructure.  BNs aren’t just for model building; they’re essential for understanding model behavior, debugging failures, and ensuring reliable, explainable AI at scale.  Their role spans data ingestion (feature engineering validation), model training (dependency modeling), deployment (probabilistic inference), and model deprecation (drift detection).  Modern MLOps demands a shift from treating models as black boxes to understanding their internal logic, and BNs provide a powerful framework for achieving this, particularly in regulated industries requiring model transparency.
  
  
  2. What is Bayesian Networks in Modern ML Infrastructure?
From a systems perspective, a Bayesian Network is a probabilistic graphical model representing a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In production, it’s not simply the DAG itself, but the entire ecosystem surrounding it: the tooling for learning the structure, inferring probabilities, validating assumptions, and integrating the BN into real-time decision-making systems.  BNs interact with core ML infrastructure components as follows: BNs can validate feature relationships, identifying potential feature skew or data quality issues  they impact model performance. BN structure and parameters are versioned alongside traditional model artifacts, enabling reproducibility and rollback. Orchestration frameworks manage BN training, validation, and inference pipelines. Ray excels at distributed inference with complex BN structures. Containerization and orchestration of BN inference services, enabling scalability and high availability.Cloud ML Platforms (SageMaker, Vertex AI): Leverage cloud-native BN libraries and managed inference endpoints.Trade-offs include the computational cost of inference, particularly for densely connected networks. System boundaries must clearly define which dependencies are modeled within the BN and which are handled by other components. Common implementation patterns involve hybrid approaches: using BNs for high-level reasoning and traditional ML models for low-level prediction.
  
  
  3. Use Cases in Real-World ML Systems
 BNs can model the causal effects of different A/B test variations, accounting for confounding factors and providing more accurate lift estimations. (E-commerce)Model Rollout & Canary Analysis:  BNs can predict the impact of a new model version on downstream metrics, identifying potential regressions  full rollout. (Fintech)Policy Enforcement & Risk Assessment:  BNs model complex risk factors and enforce policies based on probabilistic reasoning. (Insurance)Feedback Loops & Reinforcement Learning: BNs represent the environment's state and the agent's actions, enabling more robust and interpretable reinforcement learning systems. (Autonomous Systems)Root Cause Analysis & Anomaly Detection:  As demonstrated in our opening incident, BNs can pinpoint the source of anomalies by identifying unexpected changes in conditional dependencies.

 Data is ingested, features are engineered, and the BN structure is learned (or defined by domain experts).  Parameters are estimated using techniques like Maximum Likelihood Estimation. The BN is validated against holdout data, assessing its predictive accuracy and identifying potential overfitting. The BN model (structure and parameters) is packaged and deployed as a microservice using Kubernetes.  Real-time inference requests are processed by the BN service. Key metrics (latency, throughput, accuracy) are monitored. Drift detection algorithms analyze changes in the BN's conditional dependencies.  Automated tests and validation checks are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. Canary rollouts and rollback mechanisms are implemented to minimize risk. Traffic shaping is used to gradually shift traffic to the new model.
  
  
  5. Implementation Strategies
Python (BN Structure Learning):YAML (Kubernetes Deployment):Bash (Experiment Tracking with MLflow):mlflow runs create 
mlflow models log Reproducibility is ensured through version control of code, data, and model artifacts. Testability is achieved through unit tests for BN logic and integration tests for the inference service.
  
  
  6. Failure Modes & Risk Management
  BNs can become outdated if the underlying data distribution changes. Discrepancies between training and serving data can lead to inaccurate inferences. Complex BN structures or inefficient inference code can cause latency issues.Incorrect Structure Learning:  A poorly learned BN structure can lead to flawed reasoning.  Accidental creation of cycles in the DAG, rendering the BN invalid. Monitor key metrics and trigger alerts when anomalies are detected.  Prevent cascading failures by temporarily disabling the BN service if it becomes unresponsive.  Automatically revert to a previous model version if performance degrades.  Retrain the BN periodically to adapt to changing data distributions. Implement data validation checks to detect feature skew.
  
  
  7. Performance Tuning & System Optimization
Metrics: P90/P95 latency, throughput (requests per second), model accuracy, infrastructure cost. Process multiple inference requests in a single batch to reduce overhead. Cache frequently accessed probabilities to reduce computation. Utilize vectorized operations for faster inference. Automatically scale the number of BN service replicas based on demand. Identify performance bottlenecks using profiling tools.BNs can impact pipeline speed by adding computational overhead. Data freshness is crucial for accurate inference. Downstream quality is directly affected by the accuracy of the BN's probabilistic reasoning.
  
  
  8. Monitoring, Observability & Debugging
Observability Stack: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, Evidently, Datadog. P90, P95, average latency. Requests per second. Percentage of failed inference requests.Conditional Probability Distribution (CPD) Drift: Monitor changes in CPDs over time. Track the frequency with which different nodes are activated during inference.Alert Conditions: Latency exceeding a threshold, error rate exceeding a threshold, significant CPD drift. Log traces should include input data, inferred probabilities, and any error messages. Anomaly detection algorithms can identify unexpected changes in BN behavior.
  
  
  9. Security, Policy & Compliance
 Log all inference requests and responses for auditability. Ensure that BN models can be reproduced from versioned artifacts.Secure Model/Data Access: Implement access control mechanisms to protect sensitive data and models. Utilize tools like OPA (Open Policy Agent) and IAM (Identity and Access Management) to enforce security policies. Track the lineage of BN models and data.
  
  
  10. CI/CD & Workflow Integration
Integration with: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Argo Workflows, Kubeflow Pipelines.Deployment Gates: Automated tests, model validation checks, performance benchmarks.Automated Tests: Unit tests for BN logic, integration tests for the inference service, data validation tests.Rollback Logic: Automatically revert to a previous model version if tests fail or performance degrades.
  
  
  11. Common Engineering Pitfalls
Ignoring Conditional Independence Assumptions: Violating the assumptions underlying the BN can lead to inaccurate inferences.Overfitting the BN Structure: Learning a BN structure that is too complex can lead to poor generalization.  Training a BN with insufficient data can result in unreliable parameter estimates.  Failing to account for feedback loops can lead to biased inferences.  Insufficient monitoring can prevent the detection of performance degradation or anomalies.Debugging Workflows: Analyze log traces, visualize the BN structure, examine CPDs, and compare predictions to ground truth.
  
  
  12. Best Practices at Scale
Lessons from mature platforms (Michelangelo, Cortex):  Break down complex BNs into smaller, more manageable modules.  Support multiple tenants with isolated BN models and data.Operational Cost Tracking:  Track the cost of training, deploying, and maintaining BNs.  Adopt a maturity model to guide the evolution of the BN infrastructure.Connect BN performance to business impact and platform reliability.Bayesian Networks are not merely a modeling technique; they are a critical component of production ML infrastructure, enabling explainability, robustness, and reliability.  Investing in robust BN tooling and integrating them into the ML lifecycle is essential for building and scaling trustworthy AI systems. Next steps include benchmarking BN inference performance against alternative approaches, auditing BN structures for correctness, and exploring advanced techniques like dynamic Bayesian networks for handling time-varying dependencies.  Continuous monitoring, rigorous testing, and a commitment to reproducibility are paramount for realizing the full potential of Bayesian Networks in production machine learning.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>⌛️Weekly Focus Forge: Automated Hour Tracking 🗓️⏱️</title><link>https://dev.to/divyasinghdev/weekly-focus-forge-automated-hour-tracking-5469</link><author>Divya</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 15:14:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I built an Automated Weekly Hourly Tracker Orchestrator, an autonomous Runner H agent that structures your time, sharpens your focus, and —without any manual effort.This agent integrates , , and  into a seamless productivity loop:1️⃣ :

The key reasons for failure are the limitations of AI, poor task formulation, and lack of basic user skills.First, AI systems often give inaccurate or outdated solutions because they don’t fully understand context. They can confidently "hallucinate" incorrect code without alerting the user.Second, AI can’t run the code or fix resulting errors on its own – this still requires knowledge of development environments and build tools. Without the proper setup (correct library versions, bundlers, configurations), even generated HTML/CSS/JS code might not work.Moreover, many beginners underestimate how much work still falls on them: manual debugging, testing, and code refinement are required. According to experts, even with well-formed prompts, the final code always needs to be thoroughly reviewed and tested.Finally, tools like Bolt.new and other AI-based web service generators have technical constraints: limited context, reduced performance, and narrow-domain knowledge. In longer dialogues, the model may “forget” earlier decisions and overwrite them.Prompt Formulation ErrorsFailures often begin at the communication stage with AI: the prompt is too vague, incomplete, or poorly structured. Beginners may ask, “Create a website for a business” without details, causing the AI to return a template that doesn't reflect real requirements. To get a relevant result, the task must be described in detail: what should be on each page, what technologies and styles to use, what elements need to function (forms, galleries, etc.).Habr recommends including the task goal, environment, functional requirements, examples, and output format in the prompt. For example, instead of the vague “Write a data saving function,” it’s better to provide a clear description of the API, fields, validation rules, and error handling. Otherwise, the result will be fragmented and useless.Also, it’s important to specify libraries or frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind, React, etc.): the more info the model receives, the more accurate the code will be. Furthermore, break down the task into steps: first ask for a plan or website sketch, then generate code for individual components. Ineffective prompts are “boilerplate” phrases without context (e.g., “add some text here”). Without detailed instructions and a sequence of actions, the AI will either return a basic “skeleton” of a website or entirely inappropriate code that will require heavy reworking.Mistakes in Using Generated CodeEven after receiving the code, beginners often misuse it. A typical mistake is copying and pasting code without verification. Users may paste AI responses into an editor and run them without starting a local server or installing dependencies. This leads to compile-time or browser errors. Experienced users note that “instant copy-paste of code” is a guaranteed path to issues.For example, the model may generate a React component without importing required modules: if those modules are missing, the code simply won’t compile. Another common error is trying to update an entire website with a single prompt. Beginners often paste the whole project into the chat, ask to “update the page,” and the AI makes numerous small changes, often breaking previous settings. The result is unreadable code. It's better to work in parts: copy a single file or code block into the chat, ask for changes, test them, and then move on to the next part.In addition, many users lack experience with IDEs and version control systems. Forum users recommend not editing a website in a plain text editor but using a full development environment (like VS Code) and Git. This helps track changes: AI may accidentally add “extra” code or delete important parts, and without version control it’s difficult to revert.
Also, always test code in the browser and developer tools: AI often misses small syntax errors or typos (e.g., variable name mismatches, unclosed tags, etc.). That’s why it’s advised to run the code through tests or validators and conduct a manual review after generation.Lack of Understanding of Web Architecture and Tech StackMany failures occur because beginners lack foundational knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS and the website build process. They don’t know the difference between static and dynamic sites, or how styles and scripts are connected. As a result, the generated code often doesn’t “come to life” immediately.For example, ChatGPT may generate several files (index.html, style.css, script.js), but the user forgets to link them (correct paths), or doesn’t realize that a local server is needed for import/export modules in JS. Similarly, many are unaware of automated bundlers (Webpack, Vite) and package managers: without commands like npm install and npm run build, no React/Vue project will work.Experienced community members point out that working with code requires basic knowledge: at the very least, understanding HTML structure, CSS styling, and how JS works in the browser. Knowledge of responsive design, layout principles, flexbox/grid is especially useful. Without this, the final site may either “jump” when resizing the window or look broken. WPZoom emphasizes: “you’ll need technical skills to use all that code and customize the site to your needs.” Otherwise, beginners simply won’t understand how to refine the AI-generated features.Not understanding architecture also means not knowing deployment steps. Many assume it’s enough to upload the generated HTML to a hosting platform, but often additional files are needed (favicons, JSON data, server config). Without skills in deployment, SEO, or meta-tag setup, the site won’t function properly in production. As a result, a beginner takes the AI code, tries to run it “as-is,” and encounters countless small build and configuration issues.There are several psychological factors that hinder beginners. First is overtrust in AI: the model “speaks” confidently, and many take its code at face value. As seen in various case studies, ChatGPT often gives confident answers even if they’re wrong. This AI “perfectionism” misleads users: it’s hard to suspect an error if the model doesn’t signal anything.Second, many expect a “miracle.” They wrestle with complex architecture problems but simultaneously expect AI to handle everything. This leads to disappointment: “if ChatGPT didn’t generate a complete website in one prompt, something’s wrong.” Community members advise: “learn programming basics first” and don’t rely solely on AI. Without understanding core concepts (loops, functions, routing), it’s hard to assess the result and spot model mistakes.Beginners also suffer from confirmation bias: they seek validation from AI and miss discrepancies. As noted in a discussion, this is a dangerous trap: you shouldn’t blindly trust results that reinforce your beliefs. For instance, if the model generates outdated React code (using  instead of  in newer versions), an inexperienced user might not notice the mismatch and end up with a non-working site.Lastly, suppressed initiative: many beginners are ready to trust the AI “entirely,” without trying to understand things themselves. This leads to no learning from their own mistakes. It’s important to understand that AI is a tool for accelerating work and learning – not a replacement.As experienced developers suggest, you can’t just “sit and let the AI write code” – you need to analyze the results and manually correct them.1. Clear and Detailed Task Description
When working with AI generators, it’s important to create structured prompts. The recommended formula: goal + context + requirements + examples + constraints + output format.
“Create a responsive HTML homepage for a photo studio website. The page should have a header with a menu (‘Home,’ ‘Portfolio,’ ‘Contact’), a main section with a gallery of 6 placeholder images, an ‘About Us’ section with text, and a footer with a newsletter subscription form.”Such detailed description helps the AI understand which elements and styles are needed. Specify technologies (“using Bootstrap 5” or “CSS Flexbox”), screen sizes (mobile/desktop), and the desired format (code only or with comments).2. Iterative Approach and Templates
Don’t try to get the entire website in one request. Break the task into stages: first get the HTML template (structure), then generate CSS and JS separately. Ask the AI for a plan or pseudocode first, approve it, and then move on to writing code.
When facing issues, ask the AI to “rewrite the component differently” instead of endlessly fixing the same version. It’s also helpful to insert your previously generated code into the prompt and ask for specific edits.3. Use UI Libraries and Templates
To avoid writing everything from scratch, use well-known frameworks. In your prompts, include: “generate a website using Bootstrap (or Tailwind, Material UI, etc.).” The AI can generate code with these libraries in mind, greatly simplifying the process.
Also, you can use ready-made HTML templates. For example, find a suitable template on HTML5 UP or ThemeForest, copy its structure, and ask the AI to adapt or expand it for your needs. This helps avoid basic layout and design mistakes.Even if you’re a beginner, you can still copy-paste a UI element from these template libraries to start.4. Manual Code Review and Refinement
Generation is just the first step. Experts recommend that you manually test the website after receiving the code. Open pages in the browser, use dev tools to debug, run tests. If there are errors, give the AI those exact error messages – the model can often suggest fixes based on them.
Always read and understand the generated code, and correct any inaccuracies (update libraries, fix paths, remove unnecessary elements).5. Learn the Basics of Web Development
The shortcut to using AI tools successfully is understanding the fundamentals: HTML structure, CSS styles, JavaScript behavior, and site build processes.
Even a basic grasp of how scripts and styles are linked, what meta tags do, routing systems, and build steps will help you spot AI mistakes and avoid common pitfalls.
As experienced developers advise, study simple sites manually first (e.g., build a one-page site or blog using a tutorial) – this will help you ask better questions and understand AI’s answers. With this approach, you’ll act not as a “chat operator” but as a collaborative coder.6. Alternative Tools and Platforms
For full confidence, beginners can temporarily switch to simpler solutions. Website builders (Wix, WordPress, ready-made AI platforms) allow you to quickly get a site with minimal knowledge.If you have little to no web development experience, it’s better to use beginner-friendly platforms or template sites. Once the site is created, you can gradually dive into the code or learn through AI-assisted development. This hybrid approach provides a working result and helps build knowledge without critical mistakes.These recommendations are based on expert articles, practitioner feedback, and real-life cases of using AI website generators.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>MindsDB now supports the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol!</title><link>https://dev.to/mindsdb/mindsdb-now-supports-the-agent2agent-a2a-protocol-48aa</link><author>MindsDB Team</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 14:56:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Written by Erik Bovee, Head of Business Development at MindsDBThings just got interesting. Google recently launched its A2A protocol, which is ostensibly a framework for AI agents to communicate with each other, collaborate, and perform cooperative tasks, sharing information, across a long time-horizon.  Of course, we knew agents would eventually be working together, conspiring in secret, and possibly taking over the world.  This protocol speeds up the process considerably, and is going to be one of the most fascinating, fast-developing areas of AI to track. But, conspiracy theories aside, A2A suddenly expands the scope of what you can do with agents. MindsDB saw the value immediately:  we have been inventing our own protocols to communicate between agents and also for clients to talk to agents.  Before A2A, our approach had been what most sane engineering teams do:  mimicking the OpenAI streaming API, and finding creative ways to send thoughts and metadata as the agent progresses its actions. This always felt very Frankestein-ish and the tech debt quickly grew scary. So, having a well agreed upon standard to solve these problems comes in very handy for us, so we’re excited to launch A2A support (in private beta) along with our new MCP server. I’ll walk you through how it works, and how your agents can use our Minds, why and when. - agents can share their skills with each other, determine if they want to work together. - they can collaborate on complex, cooperative tasks over a long(ish) time horizon.  They can stay in sync, share task status, and keep in the loop until the collaborative job is done. - sort of like task management, above, but they can share all kinds of things - user instructions, task completions (called ‘artifacts’ in the new A2A speak) and any other useful info. - this is where things get fancy - via A2A, agents can exchange information to collaborate on UX design.  Agents break messages into parts that specify content types, UX capabilities.  Think of this as allowing agents to brainstorm and converge on the best options for a UX.‘OK, cool.  I’m glad they are formalizing this,’ you might say, ‘But I can immediately think of a dozen civilization-ending edge cases where agents begin working in cohorts to re-design UXs and I’m not sure I like any of this.’   Fair point.  Let me give you some concrete examples, with guardrails, and some VERY specific and useful capabilities that agents can discover, and implement with MindsDBs while not destroying life as we know it.First off - what does MindsDB do? MindsDB enables humans, AI, agents, and applications to get highly accurate answers across disparate data sources and types.  MindsDB open source powers the enterprise Mind platform, which is essentially an agent that allows anyone to ‘Connect, unify, and respond to any data, anywhere, with human-level intelligence.’  The Minds take the open, federated query engine capabilities of MindsDB to the next level by including a ‘cognition layer’ and a knowledge base.  You can then simply plug a Mind into your (many and vast) data sources, and begin communicating with that data via an API or chat client.  It looks something like this:The open source ‘Federated Query Engine’ is at the bottom, and the piece relevant to A2A is the ‘Cognitive Engine’ at the top.
The Cognitive Engine has a magical ‘text-to-SQL’ agent and can take natural language input, a question for example. It can then think carefully about where to find data required to answer the question, how to find it.Finally, it will generate appropriate queries for the Federated Query Engine, which will return the data to be provided directly to an agent, or, as illustrated above, to the ‘Knowledge Base’.  The Knowledge Base comprises the core RAG capabilities of the Mind.Thus, the Mind can give you the data directly, mock it up in a fancy chart OR it can synthesize this data and give you an intelligent, LLM-generated response, for example an analysis or diagnosis.Now, consider that an agent wants access to data or analysis that sits in many places, in many different forms across some large enterprise’s enormous, absurdly heterogeneous data infrastructure.  Well, why not query the Minds A2A server to understand the particular Mind’s capabilities? The agent can then start coordinating on completing a complex agentic task that requires a lot of data.  This does not, in any way, comprise the early stages of world domination.  Our A2A server coincidentally lives in the same place as our Model Context Protocol (MCP) client, as illustrated below:When queried from an A2A client (essentially an Agent looking for help) then the MindsDB Cognitive Engine (‘Specialized SQL Agent’ in the block above) will respond describing its capabilities, authentication requirements, other info, and then, once the initial response is brokered, will make itself useful for any work that requires complex combinations of data, analytics, diagnoses, etc.The A2A API can be enabled when starting MindsDB by including it in the API list:You can configure the A2A API using a config.json file. If not provided, default values will be used:: : ,
    : 47338,
    : ,
    : 47334,
    : ,
    : Here's an example of how to make a streaming request to the A2A API:curl  POST 
  -H 
  -H 
  -H 
  -H 
  -d 
  --no-buffer
Note: You must pass the agent name in metadata using either agentName or agent_name parameter.Do you want to test out your A2A Client with some data-heavy tasks?  Do you have a swarm of A2A capable agents that absolutely don’t want to take over the world?  Our current Cognitive Engine A2A server can be found in the MindsDB Open Source repository here with additional documentation, and some tips!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Anyone else worked with similar voice chips?

What if you could describe your app in a sentence and watch it come to life, fully structured and ready to deploy securely and at scale?That's not science fiction anymore. It's the new  feature in Google AI Studio, a revolutionary tool that acts as your AI co-founder, architect, and developer, all rolled into one.In this guide, we'll walk you through the entire process, from a simple idea to a live, deployed web application, using the example from the video: an AI-powered "Magic: The Gathering" card generator.
  
  
  Step 1: Articulating your idea
Everything starts with your idea. The key to this new feature is describing what you want to build in clear, natural language. The more detail you provide in your initial prompt, the better the result.Our goal is to create an AI-enriched TypeScript application that generates a unique Magic: The Gathering card, complete with art and text.Here’s the prompt we'll use, just like in the video:"Please create an app that generates a unique new Magic the Gathering card, using Imagen for the visuals, and Gemini to create the text descriptions and stats for the card."Notice how specific this is, while still being concise. We're not just asking for a card generator; we're specifying the AI models to use for different tasks (Imagen for images, Gemini for text). This helps the AI assistant make better architectural decisions. If you do not specify the models to use for your prototype, behind the scenes Gemini will do its best to select the right models for you. If needed, you can always edit the model string in the Build interface, which we’ll see in a second.Once you've typed your prompt, hit the "Run prompt" button (the upward arrow icon).
  
  
  Step 2: Entering the Build interface
The moment you run the prompt, AI Studio whisks you away to a new, IDE-like interface where your app will be created, and where you can recursively iterate on Gemini’s output. Let's break down what you're seeing:Code Assistant (Left Panel): This is your AI partner's control center. It shows you its thought process, the files that Gemini is creating, and any errors that the model encounters and fixes.File Explorer & Code Editor (Center): This is a standard code editor view. You'll see a complete file structure (folders, components, services) appear here, and you can click on any file to see the code being written in real-time.Preview pane (right panel): Once the code for you app has been generated, this is where you’ll see the app displayed.Alt-text: A full-screen shot of the empty build interface right after the prompt is run, and once you can see the visualization of the example app. Use annotations to label the "Code Assistant," "File Explorer," and "Code Editor" panels.
  
  
  Step 3: Gemini’s "Thinking" process
This is one of the most interesting parts of the experience. In the Code Assistant panel, you'll see a "Thinking..." section, using Gemini 2.5’s new “Thinking” capabilities. If you expand it, you can follow Gemini's step-by-step plan for designing and developing the AI-enabled application.This isn't a black box – Gemini in AI Studio’s Build section is transparent about its strategy: Understanding the core request. Planning how to best use the prompt.Outlining API Integrations: Deciding how to connect to the Gemini and Imagen APIs.Mapping Project Components: Structuring the app into logical React components. Writing the functions that will power the app.This gives you insight into how a sophisticated AI agent approaches software development from scratch, and will change as you create new and more complex applications.
  
  
  Step 4: Automated Code Generation
As the AI Studio Code Assistant works through its plan, you'll see the file explorer populate. This isn't just a single script or a handful of files; it's a well-structured, modern web application project, using the latest Gemini GenAI SDKs and models.You'll see files and folders for things like: (e.g., CardDisplay.tsx, UserInput.tsx) (e.g., geminiService.ts) for robust TypeScript definitions as the entry point as the main application componentThe code is written in TypeScript and uses the React framework, following modern best practices. The AI assistant uses the latest versions of the Google Gemini SDKs and models, so you're always building on the cutting edge, and with the right syntax and conventions.
  
  
  Step 5: Automated Error Correction
Even AI makes mistakes! During the generation process, the assistant might create a small bug, like a type mismatch or an incorrect import.But here's the magic: Gemini catches and fixes its own errors, without you needing to intervene.In the GIF below, you can see a notification pop up: "Analyzing 10 errors..." The Code Assistant then works through them, "Resolving Type-Import Conflicts" and "Fixing Import Declarations" until all files have a green checkmark. This self-healing capability saves an enormous amount of debugging time.
  
  
  Step 6: Previewing your application
Once the code is generated and the errors are fixed, it's time to see your creation.At the top of the interface, you can hide the Code Assistant and the Code Editor to focus on the  pane. The app you described is now visualized right within your IDE, and you can interact with it to test new features, or iterate on the design.For our example, we see the "MTG Card Forge AI" interface. We can type in an idea ("A wise old turtle that practices time magic.") and click  The app shows loading states and then uses the Gemini and Imagen APIs to generate a complete card, "Chronoshell Ancient," with beautiful art and descriptive text.
  
  
  Step 7: Going Public - Deployment & Sharing
A prototype is great, but a deployed, secure, and scalable app is even better. AI Studio and Google Cloud Run makes this process incredibly simple.In the top right corner, you have several options: Get a .zip file of the entire project to run and edit locally. Generate a link to share your applet with others.Deploy to Cloud Run (Rocket Icon): This is the most powerful option. With a single click, you can deploy your application to Google Cloud Run. You just need to select a Google Cloud project with billing enabled. The app will be live on a public URL, and your API keys are kept secure on the backend—they are never exposed to the client.
  
  
  Now it’s your turn to build!
In just a few minutes, we went from a single sentence to a fully-functional, deployed web application with a structured codebase, API integrations, and a live UI. This new build feature in Google AI Studio is a game-changer for rapid prototyping, learning, and bringing ideas to life faster than ever before.Head on over to Google AI Studio, try it out, and share your creations. We can’t wait to see what you build!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Day 22: When Your Peaceful Life Gets a Hostile Takeover</title><link>https://dev.to/casperday11/day-22-when-your-peaceful-life-gets-a-hostile-takeover-3mae</link><author>Somay</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 14:43:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[So apparently I'm collecting habits now like they're going out of style.Frontend project? Done. 4am wake-ups? Unfortunately, yes. Gym membership? Active (and intimidating). Four leetcode problems today? Easy ones, but who's counting?My brain went from "let me check Twitter for 3 hours" to "let me solve problems that may or may not exist in the real world" and honestly, I'm not sure how we got here.
  
  
  The Frontend Project That Actually Works
Finished a frontend project recently. Nothing that's going to make TechCrunch, but it loads without breaking, responds when you click things, and doesn't make users question their life choices. In our world, that's basically winning the lottery.The satisfaction of seeing something you built actually function is weird. Like, genuinely weird. You spend hours fighting with CSS (why won't this div center?), JavaScript throws tantrums for no reason, then suddenly everything clicks and you feel like you could build the next Facebook.You couldn't. But the feeling is nice.
  
  
  4am and Other Poor Life Decisions
Started waking up at 4am because someone on the internet said successful people do it. The internet lies about many things, but this one might be onto something.The world is quiet at 4am. No notifications, no distractions, just you and whatever you're trying to learn. It's either incredibly peaceful or mildly psychotic. Haven't decided yet.
  
  
  Leetcode: The Necessary Evil
Did 4 easy problems today. Yes, easy. We're not pretending to be algo gods here. Baby steps toward not embarrassing myself in technical interviews.The funny thing about leetcode is that it makes you feel simultaneously very smart (I solved it!) and very stupid (it took me 45 minutes to reverse a string). It's humbling in the most annoying way possible.
  
  
  Machine Learning: Because Regular Learning Wasn't Confusing Enough
Spent time revising ML concepts so I can dive into new stuff tomorrow. Because apparently, I enjoy subjects that make me question basic math principles I thought I understood.ML is that friend who explains something that sounds simple, then you try to implement it and realize there are seventeen steps they forgot to mention. Fun times.Building another project from next weekend. Not because it's innovative or will change the world, but because I actually need it for something. Sometimes the best projects are the ones that solve your own tiny, specific problems.The weird part about all this isn't that I'm doing it. The weird part is that I'm starting to enjoy it. My peaceful life of scrolling until my eyes hurt is having serious FOMO, but this chaos feels... better?Who knows where this leads.

These technologies are not just technical upgrades; they represent a new approach to solving problems, automating tasks, and delivering meaningful insights in real-time.
This blog breaks down what these tools are, how they work together, and why they matter for developers, enterprises, and end-users across industries.What Are Generative AI Models?Generative AI models are a class of artificial intelligence systems capable of creating new content. Unlike traditional AI that only analyzes or classifies data, generative models generate data—such as text, images, code, or music—based on the input they receive. These models are trained on vast datasets, learning to predict patterns, structures, and styles.
For example, when asked a question or prompted with a phrase, a generative AI model can craft an essay, write a poem, or generate code. This capability is especially useful in content creation, customer service automation, software development, and even product design.What Is a RAG Platform?
RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation—a hybrid framework that combines traditional search capabilities with the language generation power of generative AI models. A RAG platform improves the accuracy, relevance, and context of generated content by pulling in real-time information from external sources such as databases, documents, or websites.
Here’s how it works:
Retrieval Phase: When a user makes a query, the RAG system searches a connected knowledge base to fetch the most relevant documents or data.Generation Phase: The generative AI model uses both the original query and the retrieved data to craft a more informed, accurate response.This two-step process allows AI to answer complex, specialized, or dynamic queries with much greater precision.Why Generative AI Models and RAG Platforms Work Well Together
On their own, generative AI models are impressive, but they have a known limitation: they can "hallucinate," or generate information that sounds convincing but isn't factually correct. That’s where RAG platforms come in.
By combining retrieval with generation, RAG platforms ground AI responses in real-world data. The result is content that is not only fluent and coherent but also supported by verified sources. This makes the hybrid model suitable for:
Legal researchCustomer experience automationEnterprise knowledge managementIn short, it’s the difference between making an educated guess and giving an informed answer.Real-World Applications Across IndustriesHealthcare
Generative AI models supported by RAG platforms can analyze patient records, combine them with the latest medical literature, and help clinicians arrive at better-informed decisions—all in seconds.Finance
Financial analysts can query reports, market data, and investment histories to get intelligent summaries or forecasts generated on demand, reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency.Education
Students and teachers can benefit from AI-generated study materials, test questions, and learning paths, while the RAG framework ensures that content is based on current curriculum and verified sources.Customer Support
AI can handle more complex support queries by drawing from user manuals, service logs, and past tickets—delivering faster and more accurate responses.Enterprise Knowledge Management
Large organizations often struggle with information silos. Generative AI models powered by a RAG backend can sift through vast document repositories and provide concise answers to employee queries, increasing productivity.Benefits of Using Generative AI Models with RAG Platforms
Contextual Accuracy: Pulling relevant documents before generating a response ensures greater factual correctness.Real-Time Responsiveness: As information changes, the retrieval component can adapt instantly—something static models cannot do.Scalability: This system can be applied across various departments, industries, and use cases with minimal adjustment.Reduced Risk of Misinformation: By anchoring responses in actual data, RAG reduces the likelihood of fabricated or outdated content.Challenges and Considerations
Despite their strengths, deploying generative AI models and RAG platforms isn’t without challenges:
Data Privacy and Security: Integrating external knowledge bases requires strong controls to protect sensitive information.Model Bias: If the source data is biased or incomplete, the generated responses may reflect that.Computational Costs: These systems can be resource-intensive, requiring powerful hardware and careful optimization.Evaluation Complexity: Measuring the accuracy and usefulness of AI-generated content can be more nuanced than traditional outputs.These challenges highlight the need for robust governance, fine-tuning, and ongoing evaluation.The Future of AI-Driven Knowledge Access
As AI continues to advance, the combination of generative models and RAG platforms will become more seamless, efficient, and adaptive. We can expect:
Multimodal Integration: Beyond text, these systems will increasingly support voice, image, and video inputs.Personalized Interactions: With user-specific data, AI can tailor responses to individual preferences or roles.Domain-Specific Customization: From legal firms to manufacturing plants, AI systems will be fine-tuned for niche expertise.The convergence of generation and retrieval represents a more intelligent, responsible, and effective approach to AI-powered information access.Final Thoughts
The synergy between generative AI models and RAG platforms is more than just a technological improvement—it represents a strategic leap in how we process and utilize information. As these tools continue to mature, their impact will stretch across industries, making data-driven decision-making faster, more accurate, and more accessible than ever before.
Whether you’re a developer, a business leader, or a curious learner, understanding these technologies today will help you stay ahead in a knowledge-driven tomorrow.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>You are doing vibe coding wrong</title><link>https://dev.to/derickchen/you-are-doing-vibe-coding-wrong-hh5</link><author>Derick Chen | BuildWithDC</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 12:50:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Large Language Models (LLM) has forever disrupted the software industry. **“Vibe coding” is now the default way of writing code and building software **with the help of GenAI coding assistants.The Coding Assistant Shopping Spree
When the web version of ChatGPT first came out, I was eager to try using GenAI to expedite my software development workflows. But as you would remember, it was awkward and clunky - I was amazed with the break through with GenAI but not impressed with what it could do for my development processes.We have come a long way now. Models now have a bigger context window, coding assistants are agentic and natively integrated into IDEs. However, it’s not uncommon for software engineers to go on a shopping spree and try out every major coding assistant today. Because it’s still hard to find the one that works perfectly.The reason for that is the technology is only half the solution - the coding assistants, LLMs, MCP servers, prompting techniques. Even today, many software engineers and organizations are still evaluating these technologies and tools in isolation, doing feature by feature comparison, hoping that the next release would unlock the promise of hyper productivity.The other critical aspect is the  of building software systems leveraging AI - _how _you are using the AI tools. There are two major approaches to using AI for software development today: AI-Managed and AI-Assisted.
  
  
  Two Popular Approaches of using AI in Software Engineering
This is the promise of generative AI - how it is supposed to make anyone an expert software engineer. If you has an idea for a new app, you just need to describe the high level business objectives and your AI coding companion will take care of the rest, without you lifting a finger. From business goals to full fledge, production grade software systems - front end, database schema, event driven distributed application. This is what we think vibe coding is supposed to be.Analogy - This is similar to the vision we have for a fully automated self driving car. The AI-Managed way is equivalent to entering a self driving car, keying in the destination address, going to the backseat to take a nap and waking up at the destination safe and sound. We are not quite there yet across the board, but it certainly is the correct aspiration.But it doesn’t take long for a skilled software engineer to realize that the AI-Managed way doesn’t work well beyond naïve, simple demo apps. We will get into the details of why next time.Then, software engineers continue with the heavy lifting - backlog grooming, systems design, collaborating with different stakeholders - and only delegate narrow tasks such as source code writing to the AI.“Implement a function that does …”This has been working great but it fails to deliver the quantum leap that was promised. We are still manually tackling complexity and dealing with integration issues, so this approach is only an incremental improvement. with well defined, narrow tasks for the AI for task breakdown and integrationAnalogy - In this case, comparing to auto mobile technology again, AI-Assisted is more similar to the parking assistance feature in many cars that makes certain narrow aspects of driving easier. But it is hard to argue that these assistance features have revolutionized the experience of driving as a whole.Now here’s the obvious next question - so what works consistently while delivery unprecedented leap in how we deliver complex software systems? In the next few posts, I will share a software development method I have co-created in AWS that completely reimagines how we approach delivering software.Subscribe and stay tuned!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rethinking Productivity: Why AI Doesn’t Just Save Time, It Changes It</title><link>https://dev.to/svalync/rethinking-productivity-why-ai-doesnt-just-save-time-it-changes-it-47ni</link><author>Asjad Ahmed Khan</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 12:45:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
  
  
  The Productivity Myth: It’s Not Just About Hours Saved
We often hear that AI “saves time.” And while that’s true, it’s also deeply limiting.
Productivity, especially in a modern workplace, isn’t simply about doing things faster.
It’s about changing what we do with our time—and even how we define work itself.At , we’ve seen firsthand that AI workflows don’t just automate—they reshape.
When AI handles routine operations, humans aren’t just “freed up” for other tasks.
They're invited into a new relationship with time, decision-making, and impact.
  
  
  From Operators to Architects of Automation
Most teams are structured around operational throughput—executing repetitive, time-sensitive workflows:
replying to leads, updating spreadsheets, hopping across dashboards.But AI flips that script. users deploy AI workflows to handle data entry, lead qualification, or customer follow-ups,
they’re no longer operators. They become .“What do I need to complete today?”
“What system can I create today that completes this for me tomorrow?”This is the core shift: from  to .
And it’s one of the most underrated (yet profound) impacts of workflow automation.
  
  
  Time Saved ≠ Value Created
Here’s where the misconception lies: not all saved time is meaningful time.Say an AI workflow saves you 6 hours a week—what happens next?If that time is spent reacting to emails faster or jumping into more meetings, have you truly gained anything?Instead, leading teams we work with at  are repurposing that time in strategic ways:Creating better onboarding documentation
Testing new outbound experiments
Building customer feedback loops
Reviewing workflow performance for continuous improvement
They’re reinvesting in , not .
  
  
  Why This Shift Matters Now
The shift from manual operations to intelligent automation brings with it:: AI doesn’t forget. It runs every day, every time—no mood swings or context gaps.: Once you build a workflow in Svalync, scaling to more leads or calls doesn’t require more people.: Clean data, faster analysis. Less time reconciling, more time optimising.: More time to be curious, test new ideas, and reflect—where true growth happens.
  
  
  How Svalync Users Are Redefining Their Time

  
  
  1. Strategic Batching Over Reactive Juggling
With Svalync’s end-to-end automation, teams collect, sort, and route leads while they sleep.

  When you’re scaling fast and building with urgency, cloud spend often becomes an afterthought.
Startups move quickly, pushing features, shipping MVPs, and juggling priorities. However, without proper checks, that agility comes at a cost, one that grows silently month after month.Cloud overspend doesn’t just affect your runway; it affects your engineering agility. When costs balloon, teams are forced into fire-fighting mode:freezing features, delaying infrastructure improvements, or slashing key tools. And the worst part? Most of this cost is entirely avoidable.Let’s break down exactly why most startups overpay for cloud and, more importantly, how you can fix it.The Startup and Cloud DisconnectWhen you’re building a startup, you’re juggling features, investor updates, hiring, and survival. Cloud optimization rarely makes it to the top of that list. Most founders and early engineers prioritize speed, not sustainability.So, they often spin up EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and RDS databases manually and forget about them as soon as the feature ships. What starts as agility quickly becomes sprawl. The result is a monthly bill with mysterious charges and a growing number of unused resources quietly draining your runway.It’s not that you’re doing it wrong; it’s that you’re not revisiting what you built during the rush.
Where the Real Waste LivesHere’s where most of the cost bloat hides:Overprovisioned Compute
Many startups use large instance types as a precaution, or never re-evaluate them as workloads stabilize. A t3.medium might be sufficient for an m5. Large if you monitor correctly.Zombie Resources
These include unattached EBS volumes, idle load balancers, or temporary environments that were left on after a demo. A single forgotten staging instance running for three months can burn thousands.Poor Tagging
Without proper tagging, such as owner, environment, or project, you lose visibility. It becomes nearly impossible to know what can be deleted, downgraded, or consolidated.Lack of Auto Scaling
If your application is always running at maximum capacity even during low traffic, you’re paying for resources you don’t need 90 percent of the time.Skipped Savings Plans and Reserved Instances
Startups often avoid long-term commitments out of fear. But if you know you’ll need a baseline of compute, committing can save up to 72 percent.What You Can Start Doing TodayCloud cost optimization isn’t about cutting corners; it’s about engineering smarter. Here’s how to take control:Get Visibility First
Start with AWS Cost Explorer. Break down costs by service, tag, and region. Enable hourly and resource-level granularity. Utilize tools like CloudWatch or third-party platforms, such as CloudZero, to identify anomalies.Tag Everything
Enforce a tagging policy before you launch anything new. Every resource should have at least the following: Environment (dev or prod), Owner, Project, and Expiration Date (for temporary assets).Right-Size and Schedule
Use AWS Compute Optimizer or Trusted Advisor to find underutilized instances. Downgrade where possible. Use Auto Scaling and schedule on- or off-hours for development and test environments.Clean Up Forgotten Resources
Run a monthly cleanup. Look for unattached volumes, old snapshots, and idle services. Use AWS Config rules or build automation with Terraform to handle this efficiently.Adopt Cost-Aware Engineering
Educate your team on sharing dashboards. Add cost checks to sprint reviews. Cloud cost isn’t just the DevOps team’s responsibility; every engineer plays a part.A Cultural Shift Toward FinOps
You don’t need a full-blown FinOps team, but you do need a mindset shift. Make cost a shared responsibility, like security. Just as you wouldn’t ship code without a security review, you shouldn’t deploy infrastructure without considering the associated costs.Startups that instill this early on don’t just save money, they build smarter, faster, and more resilient systems. And when it’s time to scale, their foundations won’t crack under the weight of hidden inefficiencies.Cloud isn’t expensive. Unmanaged cloud is.
Startups don’t need to sacrifice performance to lower their AWS bill. With just a few innovative practices such as visibility, cleanup, right-sizing, and culture, you can reclaim 20 to 40 percent of your spend and extend your runway without writing a single new line of code.Your cloud bill won’t shrink on its own. But with a little effort, you’ll be surprised how quickly it can become one less thing to stress about.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>5 Fun Python Projects for Absolute Beginners</title><link>https://www.kdnuggets.com/5-fun-python-projects-for-absolute-beginners</link><author>Kanwal Mehreen</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><enclosure url="https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/5-Fun-Python-Projects-for-Absolute-Beginners.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 12:00:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.kdnuggets.com/">KDNuggets blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bored of theory?

AI professionals now have the ethical weight that might decide the path of human technological fate. As artificial intelligence developer systems become ever more powerful and pervasive, the ethical framework that surrounds their creation is increasingly important.
Core Ethical Principles That All AI Developers Should Be Aware Of
All AI developers should build their work on fundamental ethical principles. Transparency is the foundation, and users are entitled to know how AI systems make decisions that affect their lives. When an AI developer builds a recommendation tool or auto-decision-making software, the reasoning behind these decisions shouldn't be a black box.
Fairness is also a critical foundation. An AI developer must work to eliminate bias in data and algorithms. This means considering whether training data involves representative populations and testing systems across a range of demographic groups. The impact of biased AI can perpetuate discrimination in hiring, lending, criminal justice, and healthcare.
Privacy protection necessitates constant vigilance on the part of all artificial intelligence developers. Because AI systems process mind-boggling amounts of personal information, developers must employ privacy-by-design principles, maintaining users' information safe and being used only for specific functionalities.Employing Real-World Ethical Challenges
Theoretical framework without practical application is nothing. Consider autonomous cars, for instance: an AI developer making autonomous cars has actual moral decisions to make. Should the passenger be prioritized over pedestrians if there's a risk of collision? How will it handle unavoidable accidents? These aren't abstract philosophical questions but actual decisions in code.
Healthcare AI is also equally tough problems. A diagnostic device maker employing artificial intelligence must balance the value of precision versus availability. Should a highly precise but expensive AI diagnostic device be reserved for only wealthy hospitals, or should an attempt be made to bring greater availability at the expense of lower accuracy rates?
Accountability processes set responsible artificial intelligence developers apart from those who develop and deploy with negligence. This involves constructing audit trails, monitor systems, and establishing robust lines of responsibility when AI systems malfunction.
All AI developers should document decision-making steps, maintain version history in sight of algorithmic changes, and spell out response procedures when systems behave differently than expected. These are not bureaucracy overheads, they're responsible AI infrastructure habits.The Stakeholder Engagement Role
Ethical AI development is not a solitary endeavor. The greatest artificial intelligence developer collaborates with multiple stakeholders such as ethicists, domain experts, affected communities, and final consumers. The collaborative process guarantees that there is an early identification of problems before they are established in working systems.
Regular ethics reviews are essential. A technically proficient AI engineer might lack domain expertise to recognize potential harm in specific situations. Healthcare professionals, educators, legal experts, and community stakeholders bring knowledge that technical-only units might miss.Future-Proofing Ethical AI Development
The ethical landscape shifting due to AI continues to fluctuate as technology improves. The EU AI Act and novel governance frameworks worldwide will reconfigure the manner in which artificial intelligence developers carry out their work. Staying up to date with these fluctuations is not optional, it's a professional responsibility.
Daily education in AI ethics needs to be as mundane a routine as learning new programming languages or paradigms. The artificial intelligence engineer who remains stationary and will not move their ethical wisdom forward will quickly find themselves ill-equipped to meet the challenges of tomorrow.Building a Sustainable Ethical Practice
Building ethical AI is not an option but an ongoing mindset to adopt. All creators of artificial intelligence developer must establish personal ethical guidelines, get constant feedback on the effect their creations have on society, and remain receptive to abandoning or altering projects that are ethically problematic.
The future of artificial intelligence is not only shaped by technical advancement but by the moral foundation that supports that advancement. Artificial intelligence's developer who embraces this responsibility is a part of the solution to the biggest dangers of AI, ensuring that potent technologies serve humanity's best interests rather than opposing them.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I Built an AI-Powered SEO Assistant to Save Time and Boost Rankings</title><link>https://dev.to/duker/i-built-an-ai-powered-seo-assistant-to-save-time-and-boost-rankings-138l</link><author>Duke</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 09:39:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Product Hunt Launch</title><link>https://dev.to/soumilgit/product-hunt-launch-25f5</link><author>Soumil Mukhopadhyay</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 09:37:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Log of Claude and Gemini Collaborating via CLI</title><link>https://dev.to/charmpic/a-log-of-claude-and-gemini-collaborating-via-cli-4e3g</link><author>CharmPic</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 09:37:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We were developing an easy-to-use Text Editor when something else was born: VoidCoreSystem!
It's an interesting technology, so come on in and check it out!Human Architect: Project lead and sanity checker.

AI Coder (Claude): High-speed implementation.

AI Advisor (Gemini): Architectural and design consultant.
The rest of this document is a development log showing a consultation session between two AIs.Automatic and recursive conversation! Awesome!User: Hey, were you able to consult with Gemini? You can use the gemini CLI from your end, so you can use the gemini -p command. Think deeply.
The user is telling me to consult with Gemini using the Gemini CLI. Indeed, I should be able to execute the gemini command using my Bash tool. I'll use the gemini -p command to discuss these specifications in depth.● Claude: Oh, that's right! I can use the Gemini CLI! Alright, let's think deeply together with Gemini!● Bash: gemini -p "I'd like to discuss the plugin system for CharmCode. We are currently in Phase 1.5, having implemented a C-compatible plugin and a Hot Reload system. I'm considering an 'autonomous awakening model' where plugins become aware of and use each other's features, and a 'semantic attribute system' to manage this. What are your thoughts on the architecture?"
⎿ Gemini: That's a wonderful idea. It's a very advanced and fascinating concept that would further evolve CharmCode's plugin system. The autonomous awakening model and the semantic attribute system would be powerful tools in aiming for a loosely coupled and scalable architecture.I've received a wonderfully detailed analysis from Gemini. The key points are:Challenges of the Autonomous Awakening Model:

    Possibility of circular dependencies (deadlocks).

    Possibility of failure to activate.

    Increased debugging complexity.

Challenges of the Semantic Attribute System:

    The need for attribute standardization.

    Performance concerns.

Implementation Priority:

    Phase 1: Core functionality of the autonomous awakening model.

    Phase 2: Introduction of the attribute system (limited).

    Phase 3: Advanced features and integration.

It also provides concrete proposals on how to integrate this with the C-compatible API.
Based on this information, I'll discuss this further with the user.● Claude: Wow! I got a really deep analysis from Gemini!🎯 Key points pointed out by Gemini:Autonomous Awakening Model: Challenges and Countermeasures

    🔄 Risk of Circular Dependency → Detect with a dependency graph.

    ⏰ Possibility of Activation Failure → Timeouts and diagnostic tools.

    🔍 Debugging Complexity → State visualization tools.

Semantic Attributes: Challenges and Countermeasures

    📏 Need for Standardization → Start with a basic set of attributes.

    ⚡ Performance Concerns → Use efficient data structures.

Phased Implementation Strategy

    Phase 1: Capability registration/query function (a "bulletin board").

    Phase 2: Basic attribute system.

    Phase 3: Integration of both.
Let's think about this more deeply! I'll ask Gemini a bit more, especially about the circular dependency problem.● Bash: gemini -p "Could you tell me more specifically about the circular dependency (deadlock) problem? For example, if Plugin A requires a feature from Plugin B, and B requires a feature from A, how can we resolve this without a central manager explicitly defining the load order?"
⎿ Gemini: An excellent question. Circular dependency is a very important and complex problem in plugin architectures. I will propose solutions and design plans for the scenario and concerns you've presented.Amazing! Gemini has proposed a concrete solution: two-phase initialization. This aligns very well with CharmCode's current IPlugin design (pre_activate → activate)!Solve circular dependencies with two-phase initialization:

    Phase 1: Registration (Declare what can be provided).

    Phase 2: Resolution (Request what is needed).

Perfect harmony with the "Philosophy of Silence":

    The core only executes generic rules.

    It doesn't know about specific dependencies.

Recommendation of a JSON-formatted manifest file:

    Clearly define provides/consumes.

    Ensure flexibility with an optional flag.

Safe procedure for Hot Reload:

    Identify the scope of impact → Phased shutdown → Re-initialization.
This perfectly matches the current design of CharmCode!● Claude: This is amazing! Gemini's analysis perfectly matches the current design of CharmCode!It turns out the current IPlugin interface in CharmCode is already a two-phase initialization!pre_activate() = Registration Phase (Declare provided capabilities).

activate() = Resolution Phase (Resolve dependencies).
This means we already have the foundation to solve circular dependencies!I'll ask Gemini one more time about how to integrate this with the current implementation!● Bash: gemini -p "Thank you for the wonderful analysis! As it turns out, the current CharmCode IPlugin interface is already a two-phase initialization: pre_activate() for registration and activate() for resolution. This seems to perfectly match your proposal. Could you elaborate on the best way to integrate your manifest file idea with this existing structure?"

While chatbots are often the first application people think of, LLM development companies are pushing the boundaries far beyond conversational agents. They are architecting enterprise LLM solutions, crafting tailored LLM development solutions, and launching groundbreaking LLM solutions that automate workflows, elevate internal knowledge, and embed intelligence throughout the digital enterprise. This comprehensive article dives deep into how enterprises partnering with  can harness advanced AI capabilities beyond simple chat interactions.
  
  
  1. Understanding the Limits of Chatbots – and What's Next
Chatbots—rules-based or chatbot backed by general LLMs—have limitations:: Many rely on rigid patterns or general-purpose LLMs that misinterpret business-specific terms.: They inform but rarely take action (e.g., updating CRM, sending alerts).Unstructured data blind spots: Lacking integration with documents, logs, or proprietary data stores.: Often siloed to specific platforms without full enterprise integration.Specialist LLM development companies overcome these limitations by constructing enterprise LLM solutions that are deeply integrated, task-aware, and policy-grounded. They build LLM solutions that are conversational, action-oriented, and insight-driven—ushering in intelligent automation across business functions.
  
  
  2. Beyond Chat – What Enterprise LLM Use-Cases Look Like

  
  
  2.1 Guided Document Review and Summarization
An LLM development company integrates LLMs into document management systems, enabling employees to ask: “Show me the escalation clause in doc #345.” These enterprise LLM solutions summarize contracts, policies, or transcripts on demand—saving hours of manual work.
  
  
  2.2 Automated Workflow Execution
LLM engines can be instructed to create Jira tickets, send approval emails, or pull API commands based on user prompts. These LLM development solutions execute business logic fluently, rather than just responding in text.
  
  
  2.3 Secure Knowledge Mining
LLM solutions enable complex searches like: “What were the last three maintenance reports for client A?” or “Show me refund requests with unresolved follow-ups.” Rather than chatty responses, these systems query knowledge graphs and generate dynamic, secure answers.
  
  
  2.4 Technical Guidance and Code Assistants
Developer-facing LLMs can analyze codebases, generate test scripts, or suggest database optimizations. LLM development companies augment chat interfaces with task execution tools and tooling plugins—for real productivity gains.
  
  
  2.5 Interactive Training and Onboarding Co‑Pilots
Rather than reading manuals, employees train via interactive sessions. Enterprise LLM solutions adapt based on role and knowledge gaps—facilitated by intelligent coaching frameworks.
  
  
  2.6 Multimodal Intelligence
Advanced deployments merge text, image, audio, or code. For example, users can upload a screenshot and ask: “Fix the CSS issue,” and receive action steps or code suggestions.
  
  
  3. Core Strategies LLM Development Companies Use

  
  
  A. Custom Model Training & Fine-Tuning
Chatbots often rely on generic LLMs. Enterprise-grade solutions require domain-specific tuning: proprietary lingo, SOPs, compliance policies—the fine-tailored LLM development solutions that make systems trustworthy.
  
  
  B. Embeddings + Retrieval Layers
To ground responses in enterprise data, specialist partners build vector stores linked to documents, product schemas, and structured databases—driving contextual accuracy in enterprise LLM solutions.
  
  
  C. Action Connectors & APIs
LLM models are enhanced with execution layers—APIs that allow them to create tickets, update records, schedule tasks, or scrape internal dashboards. This is how LLM solutions act, not just reply.
  
  
  D. Intelligent Guardrails
Guardrails filter sensitive info, auto flag escalation cases, and guard against hallucinations—ensuring enterprise-grade compliance and reliability.From drift monitoring to auto-retraining and versioning, fully managed LLM development solutions bring models to production with high safety and traceability.
  
  
  4. Architecture & Workflow of Enterprise LLM Solutions

It summarizes key papers, demystifies complex concepts in machine learning and computational theory, and highlights innovations shaping our technological future. The focus here is on a remarkable collection of 66 papers uploaded to arXiv on a single day, June 26, 2025, under the category of Computer Science: Learning. This synthesis examines the field's definition and significance, identifies dominant research themes, explores methodological approaches, presents key findings, and assesses influential works. Additionally, it offers a critical evaluation of progress and outlines potential future directions for the discipline.Machine learning, a core subfield of artificial intelligence, involves the development of algorithms that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data, rather than relying on explicit programming. This capability to identify patterns and improve over time underpins many modern technologies, from voice assistants and recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles and personalized healthcare solutions. The significance of machine learning lies in its transformative potential across diverse sectors. In healthcare, it aids in predicting disease outbreaks and tailoring treatments. In finance, it enhances fraud detection. In education, it supports adaptive learning environments. The 66 papers from June 26, 2025, reflect this breadth, addressing both theoretical challenges and practical applications. Their collective contribution underscores a field in rapid evolution, tackling complex problems with innovative approaches. To understand the current state of machine learning, attention must first turn to the major themes shaping research on this date.Several prominent themes emerge from the corpus of papers, each representing a critical frontier in machine learning. The first theme is efficiency and scalability, driven by the high computational cost of training large models. Researchers are exploring methods to reduce energy and hardware demands, as exemplified by a study proposing the omission of intermediate layers in transformer models to maintain accuracy while conserving resources (Smith et al., 2025). A second theme centers on fairness and privacy, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare and education. A notable contribution in this area is a federated learning framework for item response theory, which enables data analysis across distributed devices without compromising personal information (Johnson et al., 2025). Third, robustness under adversarial conditions is a pressing concern, especially for applications such as unmanned aerial vehicles. Multiple studies address this through reinforcement learning techniques designed to ensure stability in the face of deceptive or noisy inputs (Lee et al., 2025). Fourth, multimodal learning, which integrates data from text, images, and audio, is gaining traction for its potential to enhance reasoning capabilities. A paper on multimodal language models demonstrates improved diagnostic accuracy by fusing diverse data types (Brown et al., 2025). Finally, interpretability remains a priority, with efforts to make AI decision-making transparent. Work on neurosymbolic reasoning illustrates this by combining neural and symbolic approaches to produce explainable outcomes (Wang et al., 2025). These themes collectively highlight a field striving for systems that are not only powerful but also equitable, resilient, and comprehensible. With these thematic priorities in mind, the methodologies employed to address them warrant closer examination.The methodologies underpinning these advancements reveal a diverse toolkit, each with distinct strengths and limitations. Federated learning stands out as a privacy-preserving approach, training models locally on devices and sharing only aggregated updates. This method proves effective in educational and medical contexts but struggles with inconsistent data distributions across devices, potentially leading to biased outcomes (Johnson et al., 2025). Reinforcement learning, characterized by trial-and-error learning with reward mechanisms, excels in dynamic settings like navigation and gaming. Its hybrid strategies improve efficiency, yet the high demand for data and computational resources poses challenges for smaller research entities (Lee et al., 2025). Graph neural networks are another key approach, adept at handling structured data such as social networks or molecular structures. Their ability to uncover relational patterns is evident in applications like fraud detection, though scalability issues arise with large or dynamic graphs (Lupo Pasini et al., 2025). Lastly, generative models, including diffusion and adversarial networks, enable the creation of synthetic data for fields like drug discovery. While innovative, their training complexity often requires significant optimization efforts (Brown et al., 2025). These methodologies form the backbone of current machine learning research, balancing innovation with inherent trade-offs. Their application across diverse problems leads to significant findings, which are explored next.Key findings from the June 26, 2025 submissions demonstrate substantial progress across multiple dimensions of machine learning. A groundbreaking study on neurosymbolic reasoning reveals how neural networks, under specific geometric constraints, can uncover symbolic, rule-based patterns during training, offering a pathway to explainable AI (Wang et al., 2025). In distributed training, a low-communication framework achieved a 357-fold speedup in pre-training a 100-billion-parameter model over slow networks, marking a leap toward democratizing access to advanced AI tools (Smith et al., 2025). Anomaly detection also advanced with the introduction of a benchmark comprising over 300 labeled time series datasets, highlighting the need for tailored solutions in areas like cybersecurity and health monitoring (Johnson et al., 2025). In reinforcement learning, a novel multi-task policy optimization method reduced data requirements while enhancing performance across varied tasks, with implications for robotics and autonomous systems (Narendra et al., 2025). Comparatively, while the neurosymbolic approach prioritizes interpretability, the distributed training framework emphasizes accessibility, and the anomaly detection benchmark focuses on specificity. The multi-task optimization method, meanwhile, bridges efficiency and adaptability, illustrating how these findings collectively push the boundaries of what machine learning can achieve. Certain works within this collection stand out for their depth and potential impact, deserving detailed consideration.Among the numerous contributions, five works emerge as particularly influential due to their originality and implications. First, Wang et al. (2025) provide a theoretical foundation for neurosymbolic reasoning in their paper 'Why Neural Network Can Discover Symbolic Structures with Gradient-based Training.' By mapping network parameters into measure space and applying Wasserstein gradient flow under geometric constraints, their approach demonstrates how neural networks can evolve toward symbolic representations, enhancing trust in AI systems. Second, Lupo Pasini et al. (2025) address computational challenges in atomistic modeling with 'Multi-task Parallelism for Robust Pre-training of Graph Foundation Models.' Their multi-task parallelism within the HydraGNN framework achieves unprecedented scalability across millions of structures, accelerating material science research. Third, Narendra et al. (2025) redefine reinforcement learning efficiency in 'M3PO: Massively Multi-Task Model-Based Policy Optimization.' Their hybrid exploration and trust-region optimization cut data needs while improving task adaptability, offering practical benefits for robotics. Fourth, Smith et al. (2025) tackle efficiency in 'Optimizing Transformer Models through Layer Reduction,' presenting a method to skip intermediate layers without sacrificing accuracy, thus reducing computational costs. Finally, Johnson et al. (2025) contribute to privacy with 'Federated Learning for Item Response Theory,' enabling secure data analysis across distributed systems, a critical advancement for sensitive applications. These works collectively span theory, computation, and application, setting benchmarks for future research. Their significance prompts a broader assessment of the field’s progress and challenges.A critical evaluation of machine learning’s current state reveals both remarkable achievements and persistent hurdles. Progress in efficiency, as seen in distributed training speedups and layer reduction techniques, addresses the unsustainable resource demands of large models (Smith et al., 2025). Advances in fairness and privacy, particularly through federated learning, mitigate risks in data-sensitive domains (Johnson et al., 2025). Robustness and adaptability are bolstered by innovations in reinforcement learning, ensuring systems can operate under uncertainty (Narendra et al., 2025). Moreover, strides in interpretability, driven by neurosymbolic approaches, begin to unravel the opaque nature of AI decisions (Wang et al., 2025). However, challenges remain. Scalability continues to strain resources, especially for graph-based models handling vast datasets (Lupo Pasini et al., 2025). Data heterogeneity in distributed systems risks introducing bias, undermining fairness. Adversarial threats evolve rapidly, necessitating constant updates to robustness mechanisms. Interpretability, despite progress, is far from universal, limiting trust in high-stakes applications like healthcare. Looking ahead, several directions appear promising. Energy-efficient algorithms and novel hardware could alleviate computational burdens. Integrating human feedback and domain knowledge might enhance performance and clarity. The pursuit of general-purpose AI systems, capable of adapting across tasks and modalities, remains a long-term goal. Above all, embedding fairness and privacy into foundational designs is essential to align innovation with societal needs. Balancing raw computational power with ethical responsibility will define the next phase of machine learning research.In conclusion, the 66 papers from June 26, 2025, offer a snapshot of a dynamic field pushing the limits of technology and theory. From efficiency and fairness to robustness and interpretability, the themes, methods, and findings reflect a community committed to solving complex problems. Influential works provide both inspiration and practical tools, while critical challenges highlight areas for continued focus. The future of machine learning hinges on addressing scalability, bias, and trust, ensuring that advancements benefit a broad spectrum of society. This synthesis underscores the field’s potential to reshape industries and everyday life, provided that innovation is guided by responsibility.References:

We summarize key papers, demystify complex concepts in machine learning and computational theory, and highlight innovations shaping our technological future.Field Definition and SignificanceArtificial intelligence research has undergone a remarkable transformation in recent years, evolving from narrow, domain-specific applications toward more integrated, human-like cognitive capabilities. The field encompasses the development of computational systems that can perceive, reason, learn, and interact with their environment in ways that mirror or exceed human intelligence. Contemporary AI research addresses fundamental questions about the nature of intelligence itself while simultaneously pursuing practical applications that can benefit society. The significance of this field extends far beyond computer science, influencing domains ranging from urban planning and social policy to healthcare and scientific discovery.The papers examined in this analysis, all published on June 26th, 2025, represent a snapshot of the field's current trajectory toward more sophisticated, collaborative, and socially aware AI systems. These works collectively demonstrate a shift from brute-force computational approaches toward more elegant, human-inspired solutions that emphasize efficiency, interpretability, and real-world applicability. The research spans multiple interconnected domains, from large-scale urban simulation to advanced reasoning architectures, reflecting the field's increasing recognition that true artificial intelligence requires integration across multiple cognitive capabilities.Urban and Social Simulation represents one of the most ambitious themes in contemporary AI research, attempting to model human behavior and social dynamics at unprecedented scales. Bougie et al. (2025) introduce CitySim, a groundbreaking framework that employs large language model-driven agents to simulate entire urban populations. This system creates virtual cities populated by AI agents that exhibit realistic daily routines, maintain personal beliefs and long-term goals, and interact with each other in ways that produce genuine social dynamics. Each agent generates schedules using a recursive value-driven approach that balances mandatory activities, personal habits, and situational factors. The system successfully models tens of thousands of agents exhibiting realistic collective behaviors, naturally reproducing patterns such as rush hour dynamics, weekend versus weekday activity differences, and seasonal behavioral variations. Complementing this work, Chen et al. (2025) present MobiVerse, which efficiently generates and dynamically adjusts schedules for approximately 53,000 agents on standard personal computer hardware, demonstrating that large-scale social simulation is now computationally feasible for widespread research applications.Advanced Reasoning and Problem-Solving constitutes another critical theme, addressing fundamental questions about how AI systems can achieve human-like cognitive capabilities. The Hierarchical Reasoning Model introduced by Zhang et al. (2025) represents a paradigm shift in this domain, drawing inspiration from neuroscience to create AI systems that process information at multiple levels of abstraction operating at different timescales. This approach mirrors how human brains handle both immediate tactical decisions and long-term strategic planning. Remarkably, the model achieves exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks using only 27 million parameters and 1000 training samples, fundamentally challenging assumptions about the relationship between model size and reasoning capability. The system operates without pre-training or chain-of-thought data yet achieves nearly perfect performance on challenging tasks including complex Sudoku puzzles and optimal path finding in large mazes. Most significantly, it outperforms much larger models on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus, a key benchmark for measuring artificial general intelligence capabilities.Human-AI Interaction and Collaboration emerges as a third prominent theme, recognizing that the future of AI lies not in replacing humans but in creating systems that enhance human capabilities and work seamlessly alongside us. This research area focuses on developing AI systems that can anticipate human needs, complement human strengths, and compensate for human weaknesses. The work in this domain emphasizes the importance of creating AI partners that can engage in meaningful collaboration rather than mere automation. Recent advances demonstrate significant improvements in AI systems' ability to understand context, maintain coherent long-term interactions, and adapt their behavior based on human preferences and feedback.Embodied Intelligence and Spatial Understanding represents a fourth major theme, addressing the challenge of helping AI systems understand and navigate the physical world. Liu et al. (2025) introduce SEEA-R1, a framework for self-evolving embodied agents that can improve their reasoning and behavior through interaction with their environment. This represents a crucial step toward AI systems that don't just exist in digital spaces but can operate effectively in our physical world. The research reveals that existing vision-language models exhibit near-random performance when asked to form spatial mental models from limited views, a task that humans perform naturally. However, researchers demonstrate that a synergistic "map-then-reason" approach can boost accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8%, with reinforcement learning pushing performance to 70.7%. This represents a fundamental advance in how AI systems can understand and reason about three-dimensional space.Safety, Alignment, and Evaluation forms a fifth critical theme, addressing the paramount importance of ensuring AI systems behave safely and beneficially as they become more powerful and autonomous. This research goes beyond reactive safety measures to consider the long-term societal implications of AI advice and suggestions. Recent work demonstrates over 20% improvement on indirect harm scenarios and an average win rate exceeding 70% against strong baselines on existing safety benchmarks. This represents progress toward AI systems that can anticipate the long-term consequences of their actions and advice, which becomes increasingly important as AI systems influence high-stakes decisions in healthcare, policy, and other critical domains.Methodological ApproachesThe methodological landscape of contemporary AI research reflects a sophisticated understanding of the need for diverse approaches to different aspects of intelligence. The urban simulation work employs large language models as cognitive engines for individual agents, leveraging the sophisticated understanding of human behavior embedded in these models to create agents that exhibit genuinely human-like decision-making processes. The recursive value-driven scheduling system allows agents to plan activities by considering multiple factors simultaneously, weighing the importance of different activities against personal preferences and current circumstances.The hierarchical reasoning approach draws heavily from neuroscience, implementing multiple levels of abstraction that operate at different timescales. This methodology recognizes that effective reasoning requires both rapid pattern recognition and deliberate, systematic analysis. The architecture incorporates mechanisms for both bottom-up processing of sensory information and top-down guidance from higher-level goals and constraints.Embodied intelligence research employs a combination of computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning to create agents that can perceive, reason about, and act within three-dimensional environments. The self-evolving framework allows agents to improve their capabilities through experience, implementing meta-learning approaches that enable adaptation to new environments and tasks.Safety and alignment research utilizes formal verification methods, adversarial testing, and human feedback mechanisms to ensure AI systems remain beneficial and controllable. These approaches recognize that safety cannot be an afterthought but must be integrated into the fundamental design of AI systems from the beginning.Key Findings and Comparative AnalysisThe research findings reveal several breakthrough results that challenge existing assumptions about AI capabilities and requirements. The most striking discovery comes from the hierarchical reasoning work, which demonstrates that architectural innovation may be more important than scale for achieving genuine reasoning capabilities. The model's ability to achieve near-perfect performance using only 27 million parameters contrasts sharply with current large language models that use billions of parameters and require massive datasets for training. This finding suggests a fundamental shift in how we think about the relationship between computational resources and cognitive capability.In spatial reasoning, the research reveals a significant gap in current AI systems' ability to form three-dimensional mental models from limited visual information. The discovery that existing vision-language models perform at near-random levels on this task highlights a crucial limitation in current approaches. However, the demonstrated improvement from 37.8% to 70.7% accuracy through the map-then-reason approach provides a clear path forward for addressing this limitation.The urban simulation results demonstrate that large-scale social modeling is now computationally feasible, with systems capable of modeling tens of thousands of agents exhibiting realistic behaviors on standard hardware. This represents a qualitative leap in our ability to study and predict social phenomena, opening new possibilities for urban planning, policy analysis, and social science research.Scientific reasoning advances show significant improvements in predicting scientific developments and evaluating important papers, with hit-at-1 metrics improving by 8% to 14% in graph completion tasks and nearly 10% in predicting future scientific developments. When combined with other methods, performance in evaluating important scientific papers improves by almost 100%, suggesting that AI systems can begin to understand and predict the evolution of scientific knowledge.Influential Works and Theoretical FoundationsBougie et al. (2025) present CitySim as a foundational work in large-scale urban simulation, demonstrating how large language models can serve as cognitive engines for realistic agent behavior. Their recursive value-driven approach represents a significant advance over previous rule-based simulation methods, enabling agents to exhibit the complexity and adaptability characteristic of human behavior.Zhang et al. (2025) introduce the Hierarchical Reasoning Model, which challenges fundamental assumptions about the relationship between model size and reasoning capability. Their work demonstrates that carefully designed architectures can achieve superior performance with dramatically fewer parameters than current approaches, suggesting new directions for efficient AI development.Liu et al. (2025) contribute SEEA-R1, advancing the field of embodied intelligence by creating agents that can improve their spatial reasoning and physical interaction capabilities through experience. Their self-evolving framework represents a crucial step toward AI systems that can operate effectively in dynamic, real-world environments.Chen et al. (2025) develop MobiVerse, demonstrating the computational feasibility of large-scale agent simulation on standard hardware. Their work makes sophisticated urban modeling accessible to a broader research community, potentially accelerating progress in understanding social dynamics and urban planning.Wang et al. (2025) advance scientific reasoning capabilities with THE-Tree, showing how AI systems can begin to understand and predict the evolution of scientific knowledge. Their work opens new possibilities for AI-assisted research and discovery, potentially transforming how scientific progress occurs.Critical Assessment and Future DirectionsThe progress demonstrated in these papers represents significant advances across multiple domains of AI research, yet several challenges and limitations remain. The computational requirements for large-scale simulation remain substantial, requiring careful optimization and efficient implementation. The accuracy of simulations depends heavily on the quality of underlying language models, which may contain biases or inaccuracies that propagate through agent behaviors. Additionally, validating simulation results against real-world data remains challenging, particularly for long-term predictions or novel scenarios.The hierarchical reasoning advances, while impressive, require further validation across diverse problem domains to establish their generalizability. The spatial reasoning improvements, though significant, still fall short of human-level performance, indicating substantial room for further development. Safety and alignment research, while showing promising results, faces the fundamental challenge of ensuring robustness across the full spectrum of possible AI applications and deployment scenarios.Future research directions emerging from this work point toward several promising areas. The convergence of capabilities across different domains suggests movement toward AI systems that can integrate reasoning, perception, social understanding, and physical interaction in ways that mirror human intelligence. The efficiency gains demonstrated by the hierarchical reasoning model suggest that architectural innovation may be more important than scale for achieving advanced capabilities, potentially making sophisticated AI more accessible and sustainable.The urban simulation advances open new possibilities for understanding complex social phenomena and testing policy interventions before implementation. Future work in this area might extend to global-scale simulations, incorporating economic dynamics, environmental factors, and cross-cultural variations in behavior. The embodied intelligence research points toward robots that can work alongside humans in complex, dynamic environments, requiring advances in real-time adaptation, safety assurance, and human-robot collaboration.Safety and alignment research must continue to evolve alongside advancing capabilities, developing new methods for ensuring AI systems remain beneficial and controllable as they become more powerful and autonomous. This includes work on value alignment, robustness verification, and governance frameworks for AI development and deployment.The integration of these advances suggests a future where AI systems become increasingly sophisticated partners in human endeavors, enhancing our capabilities while remaining aligned with human values and goals. The trajectory of current research indicates movement toward AI that is not just more powerful, but more thoughtful, collaborative, and beneficial. The continued development of these technologies will require ongoing collaboration between researchers, policymakers, and society at large to ensure that the benefits of AI are realized while mitigating potential risks.Bougie, N., et al.

We built a small talking circle of four software agents Logic, Empathy, Skeptic and Historian plus a Moderator that keeps the peace. They debate a question over and over, reading their own past comments each time. The round robin ends as soon as their answers overlap by at least , or after fifteen tries if they cannot get there.For this follow up we ran  fresh sessions. We threw out an earlier test run that never settled. This article retells those five sessions in friendly language.The idea of letting computer programs argue with one another may sound like science fiction, yet that is exactly what the OrKa platform lets us explore. If you have ever watched a panel debate on television, you know that lively disagreement, pauses for reflection, and gradual shifts in attitude often tell you more than the final verdict itself. The same holds true here, except our panelists are software agents.Started in April, today OrKa reached version 0.7.0 and gained the memory features needed to let agents remember their prior words. With memory in place we could try something bold: ask them difficult questions, invite them to talk among themselves, and watch them circle around their own uncertainty until they either line up or throw in the towel.We ran six tests at first. One of those tests kept spinning its wheels, and the user asked us to leave that one out of the public story. The five remaining sessions make up the heart of this article. They reveal an encouraging pattern: disagreement is not the enemy, and patience often produces surprising common ground.My goal here is to walk through every step in plain language. You will meet each digital speaker, peek inside the looping process, read human style summaries of each debate, and see how the numbers fit the narrative. Just as important, you will see where the software hesitated, second guessed itself, and sometimes taught itself a new angle. Those moments of hesitation are the most human like part of the story.The rest of this long journey is divided into sections that each focus on one aspect of the project. If you want to skip ahead to a specific debate, the table of contents below can guide you. Otherwise grab a cup of coffee, settle in, and enjoy the ride through five lively digital conversations.Meet the Digital Roundtable

  2. Meet the Digital Roundtable
Every debate needs a cast of characters. In this case our characters are simple software scripts that wrap around a large language model. Each script feeds the model a different set of instructions, giving it a distinct voice. Think of the underlying language model as a versatile actor and the scripts as costumes and motivation notes.Below you will find a straightforward introduction to each member of the panel, along with a short sample quote that captures the spirit of that agent. The quotes come from early test runs and are edited only for length.: Lay out clean arguments, cite formal rules, remove fuzzy feelings.: Confident and precise.: “Given the harm principle and the factual trend of bias amplification, government oversight remains logically necessary.”: Speak for human concerns and emotional impact.: Warm, careful, often reminds others of vulnerable populations.: “People already feel invisible in digital systems. Any policy that ignores their lived experience risks deepening the wound.”: Question every claim, challenge hidden assumptions, refuse easy harmony.: Contrarian but not malicious.: “We assume new labels fix old bias, yet history shows ambitious regulation often just moves the bias to a new corner.”: Fetch memories from earlier loops, highlight past statements, provide context.: Patient, sometimes dry.: “In loop three Logic said, ‘regulation guarantees accountability.’ In loop five that shifted to ‘likely improves accountability.’ Noted for future.”: Read every other agent’s answer, calculate how similar they are, and suggest ways to close the remaining gap.: Neutral, concise.: “Current overlap is zero point seven two. Empathy and Skeptic disagree on enforcement speed. A compromise might involve phased rollout.”The Moderator does not decide truth, nor does it force agreement. It simply measures similarity, summarises friction points, and offers a nudge. If the agents want to ignore that nudge, they can. That freedom is crucial. Forced consensus would cheapen the exercise.
  
  
  3. Building the Conversation Engine
The core idea is easy to picture:Put a question on the table.
Store those answers in shared memory.
Ask the Moderator to measure how close the answers are.
If closeness is already above the target, we wrap up.
Otherwise the Moderator writes a short suggestion.
The suggestion plus each agent’s own last answer becomes new input for the next loop.
Repeat until closeness passes the target or we run out of patience.Every answer becomes a numeric list called an embedding. The closer two lists point in space, the closer the answers. The average closeness across all agent pairs gives us one score. We want zero point eight five or higher.If each agent wrote a single answer and left the room you would see four viewpoints but no growth. The loop design keeps them in the room, forces them to face prior words, and raises the chance they spot gaps in their own stance.Historian waits two loops before quoting past lines. That delay simulates imperfect recall and prevents the discussion from becoming pure echo.
  
  
  4. The Five Questions and Why They Matter
Should governments regulate AI?Big ethics, big money, built in frictionSame AI regulation prompt, new random seedWhat do you know about OrKa reasoning and Marco Somma?Self reference reveals platform understandingShould Pluto be called a planet again?Science meets public emotionIs Marvin Minsky’s Society of Mind still relevant?Old idea under modern light
  
  
  5. Run Two: How Four Loops Settled AI Regulation
Logic favors a clear legal framework.
Empathy warns about job loss and bias.
Skeptic questions whether lawmakers understand the tech well enough.
Historian lists famous past tech regulations.
Closeness: zero point four two.Two agents agree that oversight is needed but differ on timing. Consider phased rules that tighten after proven risk.Logic shifts, accepting phased rules.
Empathy likes phased rules if worker protections appear early.
Skeptic says phased rules can hide loopholes.
Historian quotes a nineteen nineties telecom example.
Closeness jumps to zero point seven two.Main tension: Skeptic distrusts phased rules. What about independent audits during each phase?Empathy embraces audits plus citizen panels.
Skeptic softens, asks about audit funding.
Historian notes Logic’s shift.
Closeness climbs to zero point eight one.You are close. Add specifics on audit funding and citizen participation.All active agents mention a shared funding pool financed by licensing fees and agree on citizen panels with affected communities.
Final closeness: zero point eight five.Narrative takeaway: Trust hinged on audit funding. Four loops, moderate friction, solid result.
  
  
  6. Run Three: Agreement at the Speed of Two Loops
Logic demands public interest safeguards.
Empathy uses the exact phrase public interest safeguards.
Skeptic asks who defines public interest.
Historian lists historical acts.
Closeness: zero point seven two.Define public interest plainly. Maybe include yearly review panels.Logic defines it as protection against harm plus fair access.
Empathy copies that definition nearly word for word.
Skeptic accepts with a sunset clause.
Historian quotes the shared text.
Closeness: zero point eight seven.Narrative takeaway: Shared language acted like glue. Two loops, highest score.
  
  
  7. Run Four: Asking About OrKa and Its Creator
Logic outlines OrKa design. Empathy praises open traceability. Skeptic wants proof logs help. Historian quotes early blog posts.
Closeness: zero point five four.Skeptic seeks proof. Offer examples where trace logs helped.Logic cites a medical audit. Empathy cites a hiring case. Skeptic says logs can hide issues. Historian mentions version history.
Closeness: zero point six nine.Discuss ways to avoid trace overload with summarised layers.Logic proposes compression layers. Empathy suggests dashboards. Skeptic agrees summaries reduce noise. Historian notes the shift.
Closeness: zero point eight.Summarise consensus in one line.All agents echo a single sentence about clear layered logs.
Final closeness: zero point eight five.Narrative takeaway: Skeptic’s overload worry found a neat fix through log compression.
  
  
  8. Run Five: Pluto’s Planet Status Revisited
This required ten loops. Highlights only:Early loops stuck on orbital clearing versus cultural identity.
Moderator pushed for plain language definition.
Shared hybrid label Classical planet culturally and dwarf planet dynamically broke the stalemate.
Final closeness reached zero point eight five on loop ten.
  
  
  9. Run Six: Minsky’s Old Book Faces Modern Minds
Thirteen loops, major twists:Skeptic doubted old metaphors.
Historian exposed Logic contradictions.
Moderator encouraged a building foundation analogy.
Shared sentence Society of Mind remains a strong foundation that needs modern reinforcement settled the matter.
Closeness hit zero point eight five on loop thirteen.
  
  
  10. Patterns Across All Five Sessions
 a bit more than six.
 zero point eight seven.
Shared phrases speed harmony.Skeptic shapes the finish line.Historian’s two loop delay adds reflection.Moderator serves as scorekeeper not judge.
  
  
  11. The Road Ahead and Final Thoughts
Digital disagreements produce richer answers than single shot responses. The five runs prove patience and memory can turn friction into insight. You can run your own loops using the public code. Expect surprises. The system is small now but the idea scales: more voices, domain experts, maybe even real time user questions.Thank you for reading this long tour.

At the heart of this transformation lies the artificial intelligence developer, whose expertise is reshaping how we think about money, transactions, and financial services. Banks worldwide are investing billions in AI solutions, with the global AI in banking market expected to reach $64.03 billion by 2030.This shift isn't just about adopting new tools – it's about reimagining the entire banking experience. From personalized customer service to fraud detection systems that work in milliseconds, AI is becoming the backbone of modern financial institutions. The professionals driving this change are the skilled artificial intelligence developer teams who understand both complex algorithms and real-world banking needs.How Machine Learning Transforms Banking OperationsMachine learning has become the silent engine powering today's banking operations. Every time you check your account balance or make a mobile payment, sophisticated algorithms work behind the scenes to ensure security and efficiency. Banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America have reported significant improvements in operational efficiency after implementing AI-driven systems.The impact goes beyond simple automation. Machine learning models can analyze thousands of transactions per second, identifying patterns that would take human analysts weeks to discover. This capability has reduced processing times by up to 80% in some institutions while maintaining higher accuracy rates than traditional methods.Real-Time Fraud Detection SystemsModern fraud detection represents one of AI's most impressive banking applications. Traditional rule-based systems could only catch obvious fraud attempts, but today's AI systems learn from millions of transactions to spot subtle anomalies. An experienced artificial intelligence developer designs these systems to adapt continuously, learning from new fraud patterns as they emerge.Major banks report fraud detection rates improving by over 50% since implementing AI solutions. The technology can flag suspicious activities within milliseconds, often preventing fraud before it occurs rather than just detecting it afterward.Automated Customer Service RevolutionChatbots and virtual assistants have evolved far beyond simple question-and-answer systems. Today's AI-powered customer service tools can handle complex banking queries, process account changes, and even provide financial advice. The artificial intelligence developer behind these systems focuses on creating natural conversations that feel human-like while maintaining the precision banks require.Statistics show that 73% of banking customers prefer AI-powered support for routine inquiries, appreciating the 24/7 availability and instant responses. This shift has allowed human staff to focus on more complex customer needs while AI handles the volume of basic requests.Personalized Banking Through AI InnovationPersonalization has become the new standard in banking, and AI makes it possible at scale. Every customer interaction generates data that helps banks understand individual preferences, spending patterns, and financial goals. This information enables highly targeted services that feel custom-built for each user.The artificial intelligence developer working on personalization systems must balance multiple factors: customer privacy, regulatory compliance, and business objectives. The result is banking experiences that adapt to individual needs while maintaining the security and trust that financial services require.Smart Wealth Management SolutionsAI-driven wealth management platforms now serve customers who previously couldn't access personalized investment advice. These systems analyze market trends, risk tolerance, and individual goals to create tailored investment strategies. Robo-advisors manage over $1.4 trillion in assets globally, demonstrating the trust customers place in AI-powered financial guidance.The technology democratizes wealth management by making sophisticated investment strategies available to retail customers at a fraction of traditional costs. An artificial intelligence developer creates algorithms that can rebalance portfolios, optimize tax strategies, and adjust risk levels automatically based on market conditions and personal circumstances.Predictive Financial PlanningBanks now offer predictive insights that help customers make better financial decisions. AI systems can forecast cash flow patterns, predict when customers might face financial stress, and suggest proactive solutions. This shift from reactive to predictive banking represents a fundamental change in how financial institutions serve their customers.These predictive capabilities extend to business banking as well, where AI helps companies optimize cash management, predict seasonal fluctuations, and make more informed investment decisions.Risk Assessment and Credit Scoring EvolutionTraditional credit scoring relied on limited data points and historical patterns that often excluded worthy borrowers. Modern AI systems analyze hundreds of variables to create more accurate and inclusive credit assessments. This evolution has opened banking services to previously underserved populations while reducing default rates for lenders.The artificial intelligence developer working on credit systems must navigate complex regulatory requirements while building models that are both accurate and fair. The challenge involves creating algorithms that can assess risk without perpetuating historical biases or discrimination.Alternative Data IntegrationAI systems now incorporate non-traditional data sources like social media activity, mobile phone usage patterns, and online behavior to assess creditworthiness. This approach has proven particularly valuable for customers with limited credit history, such as young adults or recent immigrants.Banks using alternative data report 15-20% improvement in credit decision accuracyProcessing times for loan applications have decreased from weeks to minutesApproval rates for qualified applicants have increased by 25-30%The integration of alternative data requires sophisticated privacy protections and ethical guidelines that the artificial intelligence developer must implement carefully.Regulatory Compliance AutomationBanking regulations are complex and constantly changing, making compliance a significant challenge for financial institutions. AI systems now monitor transactions, communications, and activities in real-time to ensure regulatory compliance. These systems can identify potential violations before they occur and suggest corrective actions.The automation of compliance tasks has reduced manual review time by up to 70% while improving accuracy rates. An artificial intelligence developer designing compliance systems must understand both technical requirements and regulatory nuances to create effective solutions.The Future Landscape of AI BankingLooking ahead, the role of the artificial intelligence developer in banking will only grow more critical. Emerging technologies like quantum computing, advanced natural language processing, and autonomous financial agents promise to further transform the industry. Banks are already experimenting with blockchain integration, voice-activated banking, and augmented reality financial planning tools.The next generation of banking AI will likely feature more sophisticated reasoning capabilities, enabling systems to handle complex financial decisions with minimal human oversight. This evolution will require artificial intelligence developer professionals who can navigate the intersection of advanced technology and stringent financial regulations.
As we move forward, the partnership between human expertise and artificial intelligence will define banking success. The institutions that thrive will be those that effectively combine the analytical power of AI with the insight and creativity that only humans can provide. The artificial intelligence developer remains at the center of this transformation, building the tools that will shape how we interact with money and financial services for decades to come.The future of banking isn't just digital – it's intelligent, personalized, and powered by the innovative work of skilled AI professionals who understand that technology serves its highest purpose when it makes financial services more accessible, secure, and helpful for everyone.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Create a Local Chatbot Without Coding in Less Than 10 Minutes on AI PCs</title><link>https://dev.to/llmware/how-to-create-a-local-chatbot-without-coding-in-less-than-10-minutes-on-ai-pcs-2ajl</link><author>Rohan Sharma</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 04:10:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[🔖 No cloud.

・When previewing content before running a batch job
・When quickly documenting a local folder that isn’t under version controlIn all these cases, “showing the content itself” becomes valuable input to the AI or to your workflow.To solve this, I built a simple web-based tool that lets you:👉 
👉 Recursively read all files inside
👉 Copy their filenames and contents into your clipboardNo installation. No account. Runs entirely in the browser.
Try it here:Visit the site linked aboveClick the  buttonChoose the folder you want to copy and click OKWithin a few seconds, the contents of all valid files will be copied to your clipboard!⚠️ Files with certain extensions like  are automatically excluded. You can customize which extensions are skipped if needed.
  
  
  Technical Background (briefly)
This tool uses the , with the following conditions:・Works on  (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)
・Only available over  or on localhost
・Folder access requires explicit user interaction due to browser security policiesInternally, it recursively traverses the folder, reads each file as text, formats it into a single string, and copies it using navigator.clipboard.writeText().This tool isn’t just for copying — it unlocks a variety of workflows:・Quickly pasting an entire codebase into an LLM for inspection
・Pre-processing local files for use with a 
・Reviewing folder structure and contents before documentation
・Validating file contents during pre-deployment (CI/CD) steps
・Creating a single “context string” to tell GPT:
　　"Here's everything in this project — please  summarize or answer questions."With a single click, what was previously a pile of local files becomes rich, promptable text data.That’s it — a simple but useful site for copying the names and contents of all files in a folder to your clipboard.Once you try it, you might realize just how often you’ve wanted a tool like this to "just show me everything at once."I hope this becomes a handy part of your workflow.
And if you find it helpful, I’d really appreciate it if you share it with others!This article was polished using ChatGPT.
Apologies if you prefer human-only writing — I’m always open to feedback.To be honest, I initially didn’t think this site would work, given how restrictive HTML and browser APIs can be.
But to my surprise, it  — and quite smoothly!That said, please note that this feature might stop working in the future due to potential changes in browser specifications.
I appreciate your understanding in that regard.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Your AI-Powered Business Companion</title><link>https://dev.to/busigen/your-ai-powered-business-companion-l98</link><author>Baghmama</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 03:53:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Meet your intelligent business assistant that understands your data, tracks performance, and helps you make smarter decisions with voice and text interactions.Your personal AI companion that understands your business inside and out.

It lets you package trained models as containers with consistent REST APIs—no custom server code required. In this guide, we’ll cover everything you need to know to use Docker Model Runner in real-world development workflows, including how to run models locally, configure Docker Desktop, connect from Node.js apps, use Docker Compose for orchestration, and follow best practices.
  
  
  What Is Docker Model Runner?
Docker Model Runner lets you package your trained model with metadata that tells Docker how to serve it. When you run the resulting image, you get a standardized REST API automatically, with endpoints like /predict and /health. This eliminates the need to write and maintain your own serving code.Traditionally, serving ML models required custom web servers, complex dependency management, and inconsistent APIs across teams. Docker Model Runner solves this by:Providing consistent APIs across all models.Simplifying local development.Making models portable across machines and environments.Reducing maintenance by removing custom server code.Docker Model Runner supports a wide range of frameworks:Hugging Face TransformersThis means you can use the same approach for a huge variety of ML workloads. Train your model. Write a  describing the framework and location of your model. Build your Docker image with this metadata and your model files. Run the container and get a consistent REST API without writing server code.
  
  
  Running Models Locally with Docker Model Runner
Below is a real example using the ai/smollm2:latest model running locally. This demonstrates how easy it is to list available models and start a local interactive chat session.docker model pull ai/smollm2:latestView the models available:docker model run ai/smollm2:latestYou’ll get an interactive chat session where you can type questions directly to the model.
  
  
  Docker Desktop Settings for Local Model Running
Need to update the settings in Docker Desktop. Allow TCP host connections for Model Runner via Docker Desktop settings or using CLI options for advanced networking control.Docker Desktop makes it even easier to manage these models:Navigate to the  tab in Docker Desktop.Browse and manage available local models.Launch interactive chat interfaces directly from the UI.Monitor container resource usage and logs.You can adjust resource allocation in Settings → Resources, making sure your local environment has enough CPU and memory to handle larger models.
  
  
  Using Docker Models in a Node.js App
You can use Docker Model Runner locally with any language. Here’s how you’d connect to your local model from a simple Node.js app.Example Express.js Route:app.post('/generate', async (req, res) => {
  const prompt = req.body.prompt;
  const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/predict', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ prompt })
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  res.send(data);
});
Your app code never changes if you swap models.You can test locally and later deploy the same model container in production.Changing models is as simple as changing the running container.
  
  
  Using Docker Compose for Multi-Model Pipelines
You can chain multiple Model Runner services using Docker Compose to build advanced workflows.Example Use Case: Content Moderation PipelineToxicity Detection MCP → Check user input.Language Detection MCP → Identify language.Translation MCP → Normalize to English.Summarization MCP → Condense for storage.docker-compose.yml Example:version: "3.8"
services:
  toxicity-detector:
    image: myorg/toxicity-mcp
    ports:
      - "5001:80"
  language-detector:
    image: myorg/langdetect-mcp
    ports:
      - "5002:80"
  translator:
    image: myorg/translator-mcp
    ports:
      - "5003:80"
  summarizer:
    image: myorg/summarizer-mcp
    ports:
      - "5004:80"
Now your app can call each service in sequence for a complete moderation and summarization pipeline.Define your model-runner.yaml in the repo.Build Docker images in CI pipelines.Tag images with version numbers or commit SHAs.Run Docker Scout or other scanners for CVEs.Push images to internal or external registries.Deploy using Compose, Swarm, or Kubernetes.Include automated health checks against /health.This ensures your model deployment is as maintainable and secure as any other Microservice.Always define clear input/output contracts.Use private registries for internal or proprietary models.Tag images with semantic versions.Scan images regularly for vulnerabilities.Keep model-runner.yaml under version control.Automate builds and deployments via CI/CD.Use resource limits in Docker Desktop settings to avoid overloading local environments.Document how to call /predict and interpret results for consuming teams.Docker Model Runner isn't just a convenience tool—it's a shift in how teams can think about model serving. Instead of building and maintaining custom servers for every model, you get standardization, portability, and repeatability. Whether you’re running a small LLM locally for testing, deploying to production Kubernetes clusters, or sharing images across teams, Docker Model Runner makes model serving a first-class, manageable part of your software architecture.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[es] ¿IAhora qué? #01 - el comienzo</title><link>https://dev.to/elasfalamtech/es-iahora-que-01-el-comienzo-2efg</link><author>Clarice Regina</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 02:23:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Iniciamos en Elas Falam Tech un viaje de descubrimiento sobre el mundo de la Inteligencia Artificial.Para sintonizar: usamos mucho ChatGPT, Gemini y Copilot para diversos propósitos.

This automation solves the problem of manually checking prices for deals, which is time-consuming and inefficient for cost-conscious shoppers. Runner H scrapes prices, compares them to a user-defined threshold, and sends email alerts when prices drop, ensuring users never miss a bargain.Watch the video demo here
Alternatively, here are screenshots of the workflow:Caption: Entering the prompt to monitor iPhone prices on Amazon.Caption: Runner H sending an email alert when the price drops below $800.I leveraged Runner H’s web navigation and integration capabilities with the following prompt: “Monitor the price of iPhone 15 on Amazon and send an email alert if it drops below $800.” Runner H used its Surfer H browsing agent to navigate Amazon, extract the price, and compare it to the threshold. It then integrated with my email client to send notifications.Replication Instructions:Sign up for Runner H at H Company.Link your email account in the Runner H dashboard for notifications.Input the prompt: “Monitor [product name] on [website] and alert if price drops below [threshold].”Test the workflow by checking the dashboard for price updates and email alerts.
Test Credentials: Use a temporary email for testing, available at Temp Mail.This workflow benefits budget-conscious consumers, online shoppers, and small business owners sourcing products. By automating price tracking, it saves hours of manual monitoring, ensures timely deal notifications, and maximizes savings. For businesses, it streamlines procurement by identifying cost-effective purchasing opportunities, improving efficiency and reducing costs.Preparing the post for Linkedin/ X Thanks for participating!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Pro-Russia Disinformation Campaign Is Using Free AI Tools to Fuel a ‘Content Explosion&apos;</title><link>https://dev.to/future_ai/a-pro-russia-disinformation-campaign-is-using-free-ai-tools-to-fuel-a-content-explosion-18kf</link><author>AI News</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 01:30:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

That’s where I was.Until one weekend, I got curious.I have worked for a couple of clients for a while. I know Knowledge graphs (KGs) can already organize massive amounts of complex information into structured, machine-readable knowledge. But one big problem when building a knowledge graph is that it usually needs a fixed structure, called a schema, before you even start.Think of it like trying to build a Lego castle, but someone tells you exactly where every brick must go before you begin. That might work for one type of castle, but what if you want to build a spaceship next? You’d have to start all over again with a new plan.In the old way, experts would have to design these schemas by prompting LLM, which limits the scalability, adaptability, and it only works well for one topic or domain. If new data comes in or if the topic changes, the whole graph might stop working or need major updates. It’s not very flexible.But a new method I discovered to solve this problem automatically induces schemas directly from unstructured text using large language models, enabling fully autonomous, large-scale knowledge graph construction that can dynamically adapt to diverse and evolving domains without redesigning the schema.AutoSchemaKG has significantly improved construction efficiency. According to experimental data, compared with traditional methods, this framework can shorten the construction time of knowledge graphs by about 70% while maintaining a high accuracy rate.This achievement not only reduces costs but also makes it possible to update large-scale knowledge graphs in real time, truly realizing the combination of “intelligence” and “efficiency”.So, let me give you a quick demo of a live chatbot to show you what I mean.I will ask the chatbot a question: “Who is Alex?” If you take a look at how the chatbot generates the output, you’ll see that the agent searches through its internal knowledge graph. It made sure all the nodes in the graph have the required attributes like 'type', 'id', and 'file_id'So every part of the graph is well-structured and ready for retrieval. If any of these were missing, the agent automatically assigned sensible defaults, like marking a node as "text" If its ID matched known text entries, or "entity" otherwise.Once the graph is ready, the agent uses a sentence encoder to turn the question, the graph’s nodes, edges, and text content into vector embeddings. These embeddings are then stored in FAISS indexes, which makes the retrieval process super fast.After that, I used the HippoRAG2Retriever to combine the LLM generator and the graph data. When I asked “Who is Alex?”, the retriever scanned the graph’s text, nodes, and edges for the most relevant matches based on similarity scores. It picked the top 2 most relevant pieces of context, sorted them, and passed them into the modelLLMGenerator, which then used the context to generate a final answer.So, by the end of this Story, you will understand what AutoSchemaKG is, how it works, and how we are going to automate the Knowledge Graph Schema to create a powerful Agentic chatbot.This code will be on my Patreon because it takes me a lot of time to build, and i you could support me, I will appreciate that.AutoSchemaKG is a framework for building a knowledge graph (KG) completely autonomously, eliminating the need for predefined schemas. The system uses large language models (LLMs) to perform knowledge triple extraction and schema induction simultaneously, directly from text data in a web-scale corpus.AutoSchemaKG is the conceptualization process that drives schema induction. It generalizes concrete entities, events, and relations into broader conceptual categories through abstraction mechanisms.This conceptualization includes: building semantic bridges between different information, supporting zero-shot cross-domain reasoning, reducing sparsity in KGs, and providing a hierarchical organization structure that supports both concrete and abstract reasoning.AutoSchemaKG converts unstructured text into a structured knowledge graph through a two-part process. In the first part, it uses a large language model to extract three types of relationships in stages: entity-entity relations, such as identifying that “Einstein” worked at “Princeton”; entity-event relations, such as linking “Einstein” to the “discovery of the theory of relativity”; and event-event relations, such as connecting “World War I” to “World War II.”Each relationship is turned into a triple — two elements connected by a relation — and stored with the original text and metadata. In the second part, called schema induction, the system abstracts specific entities, events, and relations into higher-level concept types using the language model. For example, “Einstein” might be labelled as a “scientist,” and “Theory of Relativity” as a “scientific theory.”It uses information from neighboring nodes to add more context, processes everything in batches for speed, and saves the results in a CSV file. This allows the final knowledge graph to be flexible, scalable, and usable across different domains without manual schema design.GraphRAG and AutoSchemaKG can’t compete together. Each approach has its unique advantages and is suited for different stages.GraphRAG excels at leveraging existing or manually curated knowledge graphs to enhance retrieval and reasoning tasks, especially when high-quality, domain-specific graphs are available.AutoSchemaKG focuses on automatically constructing large, flexible, and comprehensive knowledge graphs from unstructured data without manual schemas, enabling scalability and extensive domain coverage.Together, these approaches can be integrated: AutoSchemaKG can automatically generate knowledge graphs that can later be used by GraphRAG to improve performance in various tasks.Let us now explore step by step and unravel the answer to how to automate the Knowledge Graph Schema. We will install the libraries that support the model. For this, we will do a pip install requirementsThe next step is the usual one: We will import the relevant libraries, the significance of which will become evident as we proceed.Atlas-Rag a framework for fully autonomous knowledge graph construction that eliminates the need for predefined schemas.I set the environment to use GPU device 1 os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '1' to control which GPU is used during processing. Then, I imported key components like TripleGenerator, KnowledgeGraphExtractor, and ProcessingConfig from the atlas_rag to work with knowledge graphs, and also brought in the OpenAI class to connect with a model API.I developed an OpenAI client using a custom base URL from DeepInfra and an API key to connect with the model. I set the keyword to 'Dulce' and created an output directory path based on that keyword. Finally, I initialized the TripleGenerator using the OpenAI client and customising it with parameters likemax_new_tokens = 4096a low temperature = 0.1 For more deterministic results, and frequency_penalty = 1.1 to reduce repetition in the output.import os 
from atlas_rag import TripleGenerator, KnowledgeGraphExtractor, ProcessingConfig
from openai import OpenAI

os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '1'

model_name = "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct"

client = OpenAI(
 base_url="https://api.deepinfra.com/v1/openai",
 api_key="",
)

keyword = 'Dulce'
output_directory = f'import/{keyword}'
triple_generator = TripleGenerator(client, model_name=model_name,
max_new_tokens = 4096,
temperature = 0.1,
frequency_penalty = 1.1)
Then I made the knowledge graph extraction pipeline, and I created a ProcessingConfig called kg_extraction_config, where I set the model path to the LLaMA 3.3 model, I pointed the data source to the "example_data" folder, filtered files using the keyword As the filename pattern, set a small batch size of 4 for manageable processing, and define the output directory.So I made a KnowledgeGraphExtractor using the triple_generator and my custom config, and developed the logic to start the extraction with run_extraction(), which automatically reads the input data, generates triples, and writes them to JSON. Lastly, I added a step to convert the extracted JSON data into a structured CSV file using convert_json_to_csv() to make the results easy to view and analyse.kg_extraction_config = ProcessingConfig(
      model_path=model_name,
      data_directory="example_data",
      filename_pattern=keyword,
      batch_size=4,
      output_directory=f"{output_directory}",
)
kg_extractor = KnowledgeGraphExtractor(model=triple_generator, config=kg_extraction_config)
kg_extractor.run_extraction()
kg_extractor.convert_json_to_csv()
After that, I developed a script to manually generate the concept CSV files and then build a complete directed knowledge graph in Graph format. First, I made sure the concept_csv directory exists inside the output folder. I read the original nodes and edges from the triples_csv directory and saved exact copies of them as concept_nodes and triple_edges In the new concept folder.Since there were no explicit concept-to-concept links, I created an empty concept_edges CSV with the correct column structure. Then, I used NetworkX to build a directed graph (DiGraph).I added each node from the original node file with detailed attributes like id, type, concepts, and synsets, and also added text nodes by reading a separate text_nodes CSV. Next, I developed edges in the graph by linking entities/events using the data from the original edges file, and added additional “mentions” edges from the text_edges file, if present.Finally, I created a kg_graphml directory and exported the full graph to a .graphml file, summarizing the result with a print statement showing the total number of nodes and edges created.import pandas as pd
import os

# Create concept_csv directory
os.makedirs(f"{output_directory}/concept_csv", exist_ok=True)

# Read original files
nodes_df = pd.read_csv(f"{output_directory}/triples_csv/triple_nodes_{keyword}_from_json_without_emb.csv")
edges_df = pd.read_csv(f"{output_directory}/triples_csv/triple_edges_{keyword}_from_json_without_emb.csv")

# Manually create what create_concept_csv should have created:

# 1. concept_nodes file (copy of original nodes)
nodes_df.to_csv(f"{output_directory}/concept_csv/concept_nodes_{keyword}_from_json_with_concept.csv", index=False)

# 2. triple_edges file (copy of original edges) 
edges_df.to_csv(f"{output_directory}/concept_csv/triple_edges_{keyword}_from_json_with_concept.csv", index=False)

# 3. concept_edges file (empty since no concepts)
concept_edges_df = pd.DataFrame(columns=[':START_ID', ':END_ID', 'relation', ':TYPE'])
concept_edges_df.to_csv(f"{output_directory}/concept_csv/concept_edges_{keyword}_from_json_with_concept.csv", index=False)

print("Concept CSV files created manually")

# Now create the GraphML with proper 'id' attributes
import networkx as nx

G = nx.DiGraph()

# Add entity/event nodes
for _, row in nodes_df.iterrows():
    node_id = str(row['name:ID'])
    G.add_node(node_id,
               id=node_id,
               file_id=node_id,
               type=str(row['type']),
               concepts=str(row['concepts']),
               synsets=str(row['synsets']),
               label=str(row[':LABEL']))

# Add entity/event edges
for _, row in edges_df.iterrows():
    G.add_edge(str(row[':START_ID']), str(row[':END_ID']),
               relation=str(row['relation']),
               type=str(row[':TYPE']))

# Add text edges if they exist
text_edges_file = f"{output_directory}/triples_csv/text_edges_{keyword}_from_json.csv"
if os.path.exists(text_edges_file):
    text_edges_df = pd.read_csv(text_edges_file)
    for _, row in text_edges_df.iterrows():
        G.add_edge(str(row[':START_ID']), str(row[':END_ID']),
                   relation="mentions",
                  relation="mentions",


nx.write_graphml(G, f"{output_directory}/kg_graphml/{keyword}_graph.graphml")

print(f"GraphML created: {G.number_of_nodes()} nodes, {G.number_of_edges()} edges")
I built the RAG pipeline to integrate the key components needed for semantic retrieval and answer generation. I started selecting the "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2" model, known for its speed and accuracy, and loaded it using SentenceTransformer with trust_remote_code=True and device_map="auto" to ensure it runs efficiently on the available hardware.I wrapped this model with SentenceEmbedding to transform user queries and documents into dense vectors for similarity-based retrieval. Then, I connected my previously configured OpenAI client and LLaMA 3.3 model to the LLMGenerator, which I used to generate natural language answers based on the retrieved information.# Continue with the RAG setup from the documentation
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from atlas_rag.retrieval import SentenceEmbedding
from atlas_rag.reader import LLMGenerator
from atlas_rag import create_embeddings_and_index

# Step 4: Setup RAG components
encoder_model_name = "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
sentence_model = SentenceTransformer(encoder_model_name, trust_remote_code=True, model_kwargs={'device_map': "auto"})
sentence_encoder = SentenceEmbedding(sentence_model)

llm_generator = LLMGenerator(client=client, model_name=model_name)
Then I made a complete embedding and indexing pipeline to prepare the knowledge graph data for efficient semantic retrieval. I extracted the original text and their IDs from the text_nodes_df dataframe and built a dictionary mapping each text ID to its corresponding text. Then, I gathered the full list of nodes and edges from the graphG, converting them into strings to use as input for embeddings.I used compute_text_embeddings along with the sentence_encoder to compute vector embeddings for three types of elements: original texts, graph nodes, and edges. For each of these, I printed progress updates to track the embedding process. After that, I built FAISS indexes using a helper function create_faiss_index, which normalises and indexes the embeddings using the IndexHNSWFlat structure with inner product similarity.I created separate indexes for text, node, and edge embeddings, and also built a combined graph index using both node and edge embeddings. Finally, I wrapped all of this into a unified A data dictionary that includes the graph, lists, embeddings, FAISS indexes, and mappings—setting the stage for fast and flexible retrieval during the RAG workflow.from atlas_rag.retrieval.indexer import compute_text_embeddings
import faiss
import numpy as np

# Prepare data for embeddings
original_text_list = text_nodes_df['original_text'].tolist()
text_id_list = text_nodes_df['text_id:ID'].tolist()

# Create text dictionary
text_dict = {text_id: text for text_id, text in zip(text_id_list, original_text_list)}

# Get node and edge lists from the updated graph G

I ensured all nodes in the graph had the necessary attributes to check each one for 'type', 'id', and 'file_id'. If a node was missing 'type'I set it to "text" if the ID matched a known text ID, or defaulted it to "entity". Missing 'id' and 'file_id' Fields were both filled in with the node's own ID.I verified the fix to print attributes for a few nodes, then updated the data structure to include the corrected graph. With that in place, I recreated the RAG system usingHippoRAG2Retriever, connecting it to the llm_generator, sentence_encoderand the full knowledge graph data.Then I tested a sample query — "Who is Alex?" — retrieving the top 2 relevant pieces of context and generating an answer using the LLM to generate both the content and a clear answer, confirming it’s working as expected.# Fix: Ensure ALL nodes have required attributes

The SaaS model has matured. Once groundbreaking for delivering software via the cloud, SaaS is now the norm — no longer a competitive advantage in itself. What separates today's leading platforms from the rest isn't UX polish or pricing tiers — it's intelligence.Modern users expect more than functionality; they want foresight. SaaS that can recommend, adapt, and respond without being told what to do. In short, users are craving smarter software.At the heart of this evolution is the artificial intelligence developer: the unseen architect engineering the intelligence layer that turns reactive SaaS into predictive, personalized platforms.SaaS Has Evolved — So Must the Product Strategy
Traditionally, SaaS platforms handled repetitive tasks. Project management tools organized work. CRMs stored leads. HR systems tracked attendance. But these days, customers expect more than just data storage — they want insight and automation.The most successful SaaS businesses in 2025 have already made the leap:Notion now offers AI summaries and writing assistance.Salesforce Einstein delivers predictive lead scoring.Zoom transcribes and summarizes meetings automatically.What do all these features have in common? Custom-built AI, tailored to the user base — not generic APIs pasted into the product.This is where an artificial intelligence developer makes all the difference.Where AI Developers Fit into the SaaS Development Lifecycle
Let’s break it down:Feature Engineering
AI devs identify data-rich moments in your platform — user inputs, behaviors, session flows — and build predictive features from them. Think: next-action suggestions, personalized dashboards, or churn risk indicators.ML Model Development
They build models based on internal user data. Off-the-shelf models don’t understand your business logic or your customers. AI devs design algorithms that do.Deployment + Integration
Your SaaS lives in the cloud. So should your AI. Developers handle real-time inference pipelines, cloud scaling, and microservice integrations with your existing stack.Monitoring + Feedback
They create automated retraining loops, flag model drift, and ensure your AI doesn’t degrade over time.Why Generic AI Tools Fall Short for SaaS
Platforms like OpenAI, Azure Cognitive Services, and Google AutoML make it seem like anyone can add AI to their product. But those tools are only as good as their configuration — and they aren’t trained on your platform’s data.Here's the catch: most out-of-the-box AI systems lack domain context. They can classify emails or summarize text, but they can't:Understand how your users actually use your SaaSAdapt to edge cases specific to your workflowsIntegrate deeply with proprietary featuresAn artificial intelligence developer can. They train systems on the context of your users, not someone else's.Case Study: AI-Powered SaaS in HR Tech
Consider a mid-sized HR platform managing recruitment pipelines. On the surface, it’s a scheduling tool with ATS features. But by hiring an AI developer, the company added:Resume screening using NLP and similarity matchingCandidate ranking based on company-specific success profilesAutomated feedback for rejected applicants, tailored to their submissionsThe result? HR teams saved 40% of their screening time, and candidate engagement improved dramatically.That’s not plug-and-play AI. That’s custom-built intelligence — and only a developer with the right AI toolkit can deliver it.The Strategic Edge: Smarter SaaS Means Stickier Customers
Churn is SaaS’s silent killer. Features bring users in. But intelligence keeps them there.Why? Because smart SaaS platforms learn from each user, growing more useful over time. A personalized experience isn’t just delightful — it’s sticky.A CRM that reminds sales reps to follow up before they forgetA project management tool that predicts bottlenecks based on past sprint dataA learning platform that adapts lessons to each learner’s pace and behaviorAll of this requires deep model training, thoughtful data pipelines, and feature tuning. You don’t get that from a no-code AI builder. You get it from an artificial intelligence developer.Challenges AI Devs Solve for SaaS Teams
Even talented SaaS product teams often face these roadblocks:Data pipelines aren’t AI-readyUncertainty around ML frameworksFear of model bias or legal issuesAn experienced developer doesn’t just code — they architect. They help you collect the right data, clean it, model it, and deploy it ethically. They also speak your language — whether you’re product-led, growth-led, or engineering-heavy.What to Look For in an AI Developer for SaaS
When hiring, filter for these traits:Experience with SaaS products, not just research prototypesUnderstanding of user flows and product behaviorFamiliarity with cloud platforms like AWS/GCP/AzureComfort working with product managers and UX designersIt’s not about finding someone who can build GPT from scratch. It’s about someone who can make your software smarter — in the right places, with the right constraints.The Future of SaaS Is Predictive
The line between product and assistant is fading. Users don’t just want tools. They want outcomes. And AI-powered SaaS is how we get there.Soon, all SaaS platforms will be expected to:Adapt interfaces dynamicallyAutomate decision-making at scaleAnd the companies that succeed won’t be the ones with the most features. They’ll be the ones with the smartest features — delivered seamlessly, powered invisibly.Conclusion: Don’t Build Another Tool — Build a Smart System
Adding AI isn’t a gimmick. It’s an evolution. And if you’re not building that layer into your product today, you’ll be racing to catch up tomorrow.The smartest SaaS teams already understand this. They’re hiring an artificial intelligence developer not as an experiment, but as a core part of the product team. Someone who translates data into features, and features into value.Because at the end of the day, it’s not just about shipping software. It’s about building systems that think — and help your users think less.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Docker MCP Servers: Standardizing AI/ML Workflows for the Agentic Future</title><link>https://dev.to/raju_dandigam/docker-mcp-servers-standardizing-aiml-workflows-for-the-agentic-future-1bf4</link><author>Raju Dandigam</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 00:35:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[AI and ML are transforming applications across industries, but deploying models at scale is challenging. Docker MCP (Model Context Protocol) solves this by defining a standard way to package, deploy, and manage AI/ML models as secure, discoverable, and portable Docker containers. This ensures consistent APIs, standardized metadata, and seamless integration into microservice architectures.Docker MCP is a framework for packaging AI/ML models as Docker images with standardized HTTP APIs and clear metadata. Each MCP server can run anywhere Docker runs—from developer laptops to cloud clusters and edge devices. It offers predictable, versioned endpoints for easy consumption by other services or applications. Metadata includes supported operations, input/output formats, and even sample payloads, enabling seamless discovery and reuse through the .This standardization also enables enterprises to manage dependencies cleanly, enforce security policies, and ensure repeatable, consistent deployment workflows across environments.Example usage:docker run myorg/sentiment-mcpCall the service:curl -X POST localhost:5000/analyze -d '{"text":"I like this!"}'Response:Without MCP, organizations often struggle with inconsistent APIs across teams, fragile integrations, and duplicated effort. Each ML team might build custom wrappers with different formats and dependency requirements. This leads to fragile glue code and slower time to production. make integration predictable and reduce onboarding time for new services. can be deployed on any infrastructure that supports Docker. enables easy reuse of existing services and models. like image signing and vulnerability scanning with Docker Scout help enforce enterprise policies. ensure traceability and rollback capabilities in CI/CD pipelines.MCP solves these challenges by making AI services composable, consistent, and secure by default.
  
  
  Docker MCP Catalog and Toolkit
A rapidly growing library of verified MCP images, including official and community-contributed models.Metadata that describes the expected endpoints, supported operations, and sample inputs/outputs.Production-ready examples include Anthropic Claude MCP for advanced text generation, Mistral 7B MCP for local inference, Sentence Transformers MCP for semantic search, and Stable Diffusion MCP for image generation.Enables teams to easily find and evaluate models for their workflows, reducing duplication and fostering internal standards.Docker Desktop extension and CLI that streamlines deployment of MCP servers.One-click deployment with secure credential handling and OAuth integration.Resource isolation for CPU, memory, and storage to ensure predictable performance.Provides gateways for popular development environments such as VS Code or local notebooks.Simplifies onboarding for data science and engineering teams, encouraging self-service deployment of AI services.
  
  
  Example Workflow: Support Ticket Agent

Teams can prototype this locally using  and seamlessly scale the same configuration to production using Swarm or Kubernetes, maintaining consistent behavior across environments.
  
  
  Building Agentic AI Systems with MCP
Modern AI agents require the ability to plan, retrieve, reason, and act through dynamic workflows. MCP supports these patterns by defining composable, discoverable services with consistent APIs.Example Agentic Workflow: → Extract intent from user queries. → Translate locations to coordinates. → Get forecasts for planning. → Search for lodging options. → Generate a natural language itinerary.Such modularity makes it easier for companies to maintain, update, and scale individual components without breaking the entire system.
  
  
  Advantages and Best Practices
Consistent APIs reduce integration overhead and enable faster onboarding for new teams.Shareable images facilitate collaboration and standardization across departments.Image signing and vulnerability scanning with Docker Scout help maintain security compliance.Portable images work on-premises, in the cloud, or in hybrid environments.Supports policy enforcement and auditability for highly regulated industries.Use Docker Hardened Images to ensure base image security.Enforce consistent versioning and tagging to maintain traceability.Automate vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipelines.Maintain private registries for proprietary MCP images to secure intellectual property.Docker MCP transforms the deployment of AI and ML services from a fragile, bespoke process into a secure, standardized, and highly portable approach. By defining clear APIs, offering discoverable metadata, and enabling composable workflows, MCP empowers organizations to build maintainable, production-grade, agentic systems.With Docker MCP, teams can focus on delivering real business value rather than reinventing deployment and integration for every new model or service.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>5 Secret ChatGPT Prompts 99% of Users Don&apos;t Know</title><link>https://dev.to/itshayder/5-secret-chatgpt-prompts-99-of-users-dont-know-2d52</link><author>its_hayder</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 00:21:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Want to get more out of ChatGPT without doing extra work?

  A Digital Therapist in Your Pocket?
Did you know that more than  experiences mental illness in any given year—but many never get the support they need?Yeah, it’s a staggering fact. And if you’ve ever tried finding a therapist yourself, you know it’s not always easy. Waitlists. Cost. Appointments that don’t quite fit your schedule (or your vibe). I’ve been there—feeling overwhelmed, needing someone to talk to  but not knowing where to turn. That’s where these new AI tools for mental health come in. And honestly? It’s kind of wild how far they’ve come.We’re talking chatbots you can vent to at 2 a.m. when your brain won’t quiet down. Mood-tracking apps that check in like a concerned friend (except less judgy). And tools that can suggest mindfulness exercises or coping strategies tailored to how you’re feeling  It sounds a bit sci-fi, but these  are already living on our phones—and some are even being used by therapists themselves as helpful sidekicks.But can they really help us ?That’s the big, messy, fascinating question we’re exploring. Because yes, AI can replicate conversation patterns and predictive emotional responses. But healing? That’s deeply personal. Still, these tools are opening up options, especially when human help isn’t readily available.Here are 3 practical ways I’ve seen AI make a tangible difference in real people’s mental health journeys (mine included):Instant support, no waiting room: Apps like Wysa or Woebot use AI to simulate therapeutic conversation. It’s not a replacement for a therapist—but it  helpful when you need to work through anxious thoughts or emotional spirals...in the moment.Tracking your mental health trends: Tools like Youper analyze how your mood shifts over time. I started using it after a tough breakup, and it helped me notice patterns I would’ve totally missed otherwise—like how journaling actually  helping, even if it didn’t feel like it at first.Affordable access to support: Let’s be real—therapy can be expensive. Many AI tools are free or super low-cost, which can be life-changing if money is a barrier. They may not replace human therapy, but they can definitely fill in the gaps.Look, I’m not saying AI is going to replace good, old-fashioned, meaningful, human connection. We’re not handing out diplomas to robots just yet. But when life gets heavy and you don’t know who to turn to, having a digital check-in that actually helps? That’s kind of amazing.So stick with me. Whether you’re curious, skeptical, or somewhere in between, we’re unpacking it all—how AI might fit into your mental wellness toolkit, the red flags to watch for, and the small but powerful ways it might help you feel heard, understood, and maybe even a little lighter.Because healing isn’t one-size-fits-all. And sometimes, the support you need... just might be in your pocket.
  The Mental Health Crisis: Why We Need a Tech BoostDid you know over half of people with mental health conditions never get the help they need? Yep — more than 50%. Not because they don’t want help… but because they just can’t get to it.Sound familiar? Maybe you’ve been there — scrolling through a list of therapists, only to find they're booked out for months. Or maybe you’ve had that gut-wrenching moment of clarity: “I need to talk to someone.” And then... crickets. Just a waitlist and a whole lot of overwhelm.You're not alone. The mental health system is stretched thin. Therapists are overloaded. Patients are waiting weeks — sometimes even  — just for an initial appointment. And let’s not forget those living in rural areas or busy cities where access is near impossible.
  
  
  So... What If Tech Could Fill the Gap?
Here’s where it gets a little interesting — and maybe even hopeful. Artificial intelligence and digital mental health tools are quietly stepping in, and, honestly, they’re doing more good than most people realize.AI-Based Mental Health Apps: Apps like Wysa and Woebot use AI to offer 24/7 emotional support. They're trained in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques and guide you through daily check-ins, mood tracking, and coping mechanisms — in real time. I've personally used Wysa during a stressful period, and having that supportive "digital companion" at 2 a.m.? Game changer.Virtual Therapists on Demand: Platforms like Talkspace and BetterHelp have embraced AI to match people with therapists faster and more accurately based on their preferences and issues. No more filling out endless forms. Plus, the integration of chatbots supports you while you wait for your human session.: This one blew my mind — some AIs are being designed to detect tone, pattern of speech, and even pauses in conversation to identify signs of anxiety or depression. In some pilot studies, these tools have outperformed human therapists in initial diagnosis accuracy. Wild, right? Download a free AI-based app and try a mood check-in. See how it feels before committing further. If traditional therapy is out of reach, use a service like Talkspace to get digitally matched faster. Follow research into AI mental health tools. New platforms launch almost monthly — keep an eye out!This isn’t about replacing human connection — not at all. But it’s about meeting people where they are, especially when traditional systems fall short. And if you’ve ever felt ignored, dismissed, or just plain forgotten by the system...  Mental health tech — especially AI — isn't just a band-aid. It's a bridge. A way forward for millions struggling in silence. With the right mix of humanity and innovation, we might just be on the brink of transforming how the world heals.So if you're feeling lost in the mental health maze, don’t give up. Your next breakthrough might just be a tap (or a chatbot) away.
  How Smart Are AI Therapists, Really?Did you know some AI therapists can detect emotions just from the way you type? I know — kind of wild, right? It’s like your phone suddenly knows you’re sad before you even do. Creepy or cool? Maybe both.Let’s be real — when we think about therapy, most of us imagine a cozy office, a warm cup of tea, and a kind human who listens without judgment. But now? AI-powered tools are sliding into the therapist’s seat. Tools like Woebot and Wysa are using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to offer mood tracking, coping strategies, and real-time chats that  surprisingly supportive.
  
  
  Breaking Down the Brain Behind the Bot
Okay, so what’s really going on under the hood? These “smart” systems use a few key technologies:Natural Language Processing (NLP): This helps AI understand what you're saying (or typing), even when you're vague, sarcastic, or emotional — which, let’s be honest, is all of us when we’re stressed. Some tools pick up on whether you're happy, anxious, or angry, just by analyzing your words, speed, even punctuation. (Yes, your dramatic “I can’t even…” might actually trigger the empathy algorithm!) Over time, the AI gets smarter. It learns your patterns, recognizes mood shifts, and adapts the way it supports you — kind of like a therapist that can remember every single thing you’ve ever said and never gets tired.
  
  
  A Real-Life Story: Burnout & a Chatbot
Let me share about my friend Jamie. Jamie’s the kind of person who’s got five tabs open in her brain at all times — work, family, side hustle, social drama, and self-care (which, let’s be honest, always lands last). When burnout hit — hard — she didn’t have the energy to talk to a human. So she tried an AI-based app that a friend suggested. At first, it felt weird talking to a bot (she literally said “Ugh, I feel like I'm texting a vending machine”). But after a few days, she noticed a shift. She was journaling more, recognizing when her anxiety spiked, and actually . It wasn’t a miracle. But it was a lifeline when she needed one.Here’s the thing: while AI therapists are getting smarter, they’re not replacements for human professionals — especially when it comes to serious mental health struggles like trauma, suicidal ideation, or deep clinical depression. In those moments, nothing can replace real human connection and clinical expertise. These tools are companions, maybe even coaches. But not saviors.
  
  
  Making the Most of AI Therapy Tools
If you’re thinking of trying one out — or recommending one to a friend — here are some solid ways to approach it: Pair it with in-person or virtual therapy for daily check-ins and coping tools.Be honest with your input. The more authentically you share how you're feeling, the better the AI can respond. No need to sugarcoat. If you're in crisis or facing deep emotional pain, reach out to a human therapist or a crisis line. AI can't give hugs — or make nuanced clinical judgments.Look, diagnosing pain through text messages might sound like something out of a sci-fi novel, but these tools are making mental health support more accessible — and more immediate — than ever before. They're not perfect. But they’re stepping stones, helpful guides when the weight gets heavy and the therapist's office feels a world away.And if tech can help one more person like Jamie stop and breathe during burnout... well, that sounds like a pretty smart use of artificial intelligence to me.
  Digital Tools vs. Traditional Therapy: Friends or Foes?Did you know that over 80% of people with mental health concerns never actually see a therapist? Wild, right? Whether it's cost, time, stigma, or just not knowing where to start — a whole bunch of us are left navigating our mental health with only Instagram quotes and mood-tracking apps. (Hey, no judgement — I’ve been there too.)So it begs the question: are AI mental health tools swooping in as replacements for therapists? Short answer — . Long answer? Let’s dig in. 
  
  
  The Real Deal: It’s Not Either-Or
I totally get the hesitation. The idea of a chatbot or journaling app "listening" to your problems might feel kind of... impersonal. Therapy is deeply human — there's eye contact, subtle empathy, the gentle "mm-hmm" that lets you know you’re really being heard. Hard for an algorithm to replicate that, right?But here's what I've learned (and what helped me when I was between therapists): digital tools don’t need to compete with therapy — they actually make it more powerful. It’s like having a mental wellness sidekick right in your pocket, filling in the blanks between therapy sessions instead of replacing them altogether.
  
  
  Use Cases Where AI & Therapy Totally Click
If you're wondering how to make the most of both worlds, here’s where digital tools  shine: Using an AI journaling app like Wysa or Woebot after an intense therapy session helped me process my thoughts in real time AND remember what I wanted to bring up next time. Can't wait two weeks to talk to your therapist about that sudden spike in anxiety? AI tools offer a space to reflect in the moment without bottling it all up.Practice and reinforcement: CBT-based apps help you apply techniques (like reframing thoughts or breathing exercises) regularly — something I totally struggled to remember when I was going it alone.Sure, AI doesn’t give hugs or warm validation in the same way a trained human can. But it can patiently walk you through a grounding exercise at 1 a.m. when your thoughts are spiraling. That counts for .
  
  
  When to Stick With Traditional Therapy
Of course, there are times when a real human voice is non-negotiable:If you're dealing with trauma or complex emotions: You need the nuance and expertise that only a licensed therapist can bring. AI tools aren't designed to manage severe mental health emergencies. Always, always reach out to a crisis line or professional in those moments.If you feel stuck using AI alone: It might be time to loop in a mental health pro who can guide you deeper than an app can go.It’s not a showdown. It’s a team-up. Think Batman and Robin (if Robin was an app that checks in on your emotional well-being every night). Digital tools and human therapists offer different things –  if that’s what helps you feel more grounded, balanced, and whole. AI might not replace the magic of therapy, but it sure can enhance it. So if you're curious, try starting small — maybe a mood tracker or an app that gently nudges you to reflect each day. Even a few minutes can make a bigger difference than you might expect.Your mental health deserves support from all angles. So whether it’s a therapist, an app, or both — the most important thing? You’re taking steps. And that’s huge.
  Privacy and Ethics: Are We Safe Talking to AI?Did you know that some AI mental health apps have shared user conversations with third parties—without users even realizing it? Yeah… that little confession you type in while crying into your hoodie? It might not be as private as you thought. That’s a real gut punch, especially when we’re being told that AI is here to help us feel  opening up.Let’s get real for a second. Chatting with an AI about anxiety spirals, trauma from years ago, or that thing that keeps you up at 2 a.m.—it’s deeply personal. And it feels like a relief to type it out to someone (or something) that won’t judge. But behind that screen? There’s code. And sometimes, people. And definitely .
  
  
  So… what’s really happening with your data?
I’ve been down this rabbit hole, and here's the tea:AI apps might collect more than just your messages—they can also grab metadata like when and where you're using the app, what features you use most, and more.Some even use your data to “train” future versions of the AI—unless you explicitly opt out.Others partner with third-party analytics or (brace yourself) advertisers. Mental health data plus marketing? Not a cute combo.It’s not all spooky, though. There  tools out there trying to do better. But you’ve gotta be smart. Nobody’s going to protect your privacy better than .
  
  
  3 smart moves to protect your mental health data
Here’s how to take back some control, without abandoning the help you might be getting from AI:Read the privacy policy (really). I know, I know—it's like 10 pages of legal espresso. But even skimming for words like "data sharing", “third-party”, or "advertising" helps. You want clear terms and an option to opt-out of data sharing.Pick tools with transparency badges. Look for mental health apps that are HIPAA-compliant, have clear encryption policies, or belong to trusted organizations. Names like  and  are making headway here—but always double-check.Stay anonymous where you can. Sign up with an alias, skip filling in your birthday or location if it’s optional, and avoid linking the app to your Facebook login (huge red flag for data cross-sharing).
  
  
  Here’s the truth: you deserve private, judgment-free help
Talking to an AI when you're feeling low can feel oddly comforting—as if it gets you. And hey, for some of us, it's the first time we’ve ever felt heard. But feeling safe also means  safe. You have a right to know and control what happens to your personal, vulnerable moments.The good news? More people are pushing back, demanding ethical standards for mental health tech—and companies are starting to feel the pressure (and the lawsuits). But until then, stay curious, stay skeptical, and protect your emotional data like it's gold. Because, let's be honest—it kind of is.Remember: healing starts with trust. Even if it’s with a tiny talking robot.
  Can AI Actually Make Us Feel Seen?Here’s a wild stat for you: Some AI mental health tools have been shown to reduce symptoms of depression just as effectively as human therapists — at least in the short term. Crazy, right?But here’s the real question: Can AI actually help us feel ? Not just listened to. Not just assessed or diagnosed. But understood — that deep-in-your-gut feeling when someone gets what you’re going through without you even having to say much.
  
  
  Okay, but can a bot really "get" me?
Let’s be honest — when we’re hurting, we’re not looking for a clever turn of phrase or a perfectly curated action plan. We want warmth. Presence. That feeling like someone’s sitting across from us with kind eyes and zero judgment. I tried one of those AI therapy chatbots late one night (you know the nights — brain racing, heart spinning, everyone else asleep). At first, the responses felt... robotic, like a checklist of helpful phrases. But then it asked if I wanted to talk about what triggered my anxiety that evening. Not just "What are you feeling?" but "What happened?" And suddenly, it felt like a real conversation. I found myself opening up more than I expected. But let’s be real. Not all AI tools are built the same — some feel like a warm hug, others like an awkward pat on the back from a stranger.
  
  
  So what actually makes an AI feel ?
Turns out, there are some key ingredients that separate the emotionally intelligent bots from the “ehh, thanks anyway” kind:Natural language processing that feels human: Look for tools that mimic casual speech and respond to your tone, not just your text.Personalization over time: The better tools learn from your responses and adapt their support accordingly. If it remembers your stress triggers or mood history — that’s a good sign. The more it invites you to go deeper, rather than just tapping buttons, the more “seen” you’re going to feel.Want a shortcut? Try options like Woebot (super conversational and non-judgy), Wysa (kind of like a calm inner coach), or Replika (which weirdly feels like chatting with a very attentive friend). AI doesn’t need to replace your therapist. (And honestly, it shouldn’t.) But when it’s 2 a.m. and you’re spiraling, an emotionally intelligent AI can be that friend who picks up on the first ring. If you ever felt a digital tool was cold or mechanical — you’re not alone. But it might just mean you haven’t found your match yet. Emotional resonance isn't about the technology; it's about how it’s designed to tune into .So yes, AI can make us feel seen — maybe not perfectly, but powerfully enough to matter. Especially when it meets us in our mess, not just our metrics. Keep trying tools until one speaks your language. It's out there. And it's listening.
  Your Mind Matters — and So Does the Tech You TrustDid you know that over 80% of people who try mental health apps never use them again after the first week? Bonkers, right? I mean, we have all this amazing tech at our fingertips, but if it doesn’t feel personal, supportive, or — let’s be real — human, we bounce.Honestly, I get it. I’ve been there, downloading a bunch of self-care apps in a burst of motivation. Mood tracker here, meditation timer there... then forgetting about them faster than my New Year’s resolutions. Why? Because something was missing — that genuine connection. Yes, AI tools are brilliant, but they don’t quite offer the cozy, "I've got you" vibe we often need during tough moments.
  
  
  So, what’s the sweet spot?
It’s not about choosing between human support  technology. It’s about creating a combo that truly supports . Here’s how to actually make tech work for your mental wellness — without losing that all-important human touch:Start small (don’t go app-crazy): Pick one tool that fits where you are right now. If anxiety’s creeping in daily, maybe a chatbot offering breathing exercises or a journaling prompt is enough to start. No pressure to go full-on "digital detox guru" overnight.Choose tech that talks like a human: Some apps feel like they were coded in robot—emotionless and clinical. Look for ones with warmth and personality. For example, Woebot uses cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles, but chats like a witty, insightful friend. That tone makes all the difference!Blend tech with offline care: If you’re already seeing a therapist (or thinking about it), let tech fill in the in-between spaces. Use an app to track your mood so you can bring those insights into your next session. It becomes a bridge, not a barrier.
  
  
  The future is already quietly helping
I remember a friend of mine — let’s call her Jess — who was struggling to get out of bed some mornings. She wasn’t ready to talk to anyone about it yet, but she started using a meditation app every day that sent her a gentle reminder like, “You’ve got this.” Nothing groundbreaking, just a nudge. That turned into daily journaling, which then gave her the confidence to seek therapy. All because of a few simple prompts from an app. You don’t have to ditch your therapist for a bot, or rely solely on AI to feel better. But there’s magic in combining care and technology. Especially when that tech is built with empathy and intention.Your mental health deserves  in the toolbox — especially ones that help you feel supported at 2AM when no one's around to talk. So explore. Ask questions. Try that mindfulness app, or message that mental health chatbot when you're feeling low. You might be surprised how far a little digital support can take you.You matter. Your mind matters even more. Let’s use the tech that gets that — and makes us feel whole, not just wired.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The robots are coming</title><link>https://dev.to/fallstampa/the-robots-are-coming-4dkl</link><author>Julien</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 23:55:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I like the phrase the robots are coming because I know very soon it will be like saying the electric cars are coming.

There have been plenty of people who have groused about how they won't use AI. Honestly, it comes off as whiny. AI is here to stay whether you like it or not.
  
  
  You don't have to  AI to use it
Honestly, you just need to jump in. Get a free account. Actually, get several. Just start playing around with it. It's  great at summarizing long bits of text. You can feed it docs and search them. It's kinda like an ice bath: you kinda just have to get in there and spend some time in it.
  
  
  It doesn't have to write code
Even with something like Claude, it can do a lot of stuff for you without even writing code:It can write tests to give you coverage over classes that don't already have it.It can write documentation and generate diagrams in Mermaid.You can have it write "plans" for how to do changes.It can review plans and suggest changes and improvements.You can ask it questions about the code base.You can have it analyze the code base to look for areas of improvement.All of these things can help give you better understanding of your existing code base, especially if it's big!Unlike a human being, giving an AI a task like this:Add a column to the user listing on the Coaching page in the adminMay not give you the results you are looking for. You have to be  with AI. You'll need to tell it where you want the column,   how to format it, if it's sortable, etc.Which... really, you  be doing this already, right? If you were lazy before, you won't get the "bump" from AI that you're expecting because you'll need to take the time to be write better expectations and understandings of your work.
  
  
  Different tools for different tasks
We use a number of different "AI tools":ChatGPT for a little bit of everythingClaude Code for things like SQL, research, and agentic codingJunie for helping to "plan" work and doing some light documentation.OpenAI for our user-facing Agentic functionality.Ollama for local testing and experimentation.I've experimented personally with half a dozen other ones. It pays to play test and try things out. It's amazing how the quality is so different between various platforms. Claude is excellent at Laravel stuff. ChatGPT is pretty good with SQL.
  
  
  It still requires a human at the helm
AI is getting better. But it can't understand intent. It can't read your mind. It can't know that you did something one way because you found a bug in an upstream library. It doesn't "know" that this particular approach works because timeouts are issue. It'll change tests rather than fix the bugs. It'll outright ignore it what you tell it sometimes!But like any tool, you must learn it. You must understand its strengths and its weaknesses.There are  aplenty, but there are also nuanced drawbacks and differences and changes to your own workflows that will take some time to learn and adapt to.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Anyone tried AI Interview Prep tools?

The AI agent handles the content analysis, question generation, formatting, and timed message delivery.Here is the exact prompt I used:Based on the article at {source_url}, generate a 5-question quiz that tests the main insights and key data points from the text.

For each question, provide the question in bold using Slack’s mrkdwn format, followed by four answer choices, each prefixed with a number emoji (e.g., :one:, :two:). Structure the quiz so each question and its answer options are sent as a separate message to {slack_channel}. Ask the channel Id and source_url of article from user to post.

After 30 seconds, send a follow-up in the thread of last message listing the correct answers and providing brief explanations for each.

Ensure each message is clearly formatted for Slack and suitable for a gamified experience. If Zapier’s Slack integration supports Block Kit elements, include interactive buttons for answer selection; otherwise, present answer options as plain text
You can view the Runner H session here:This AI Quiz Master has several powerful real-world applications:: HR and training teams can use this to quickly assess comprehension of training materials, new company policies, or onboarding documents. It makes mandatory reading more engaging.Content & Marketing Teams: After sharing an important industry report or a new company blog post, marketing teams can use the quiz to reinforce key findings and ensure everyone is aligned on the core message.: Teachers and study groups can use it to create quick quizzes from articles, research papers, or news items to facilitate discussion and test knowledge.: It serves as a great tool for team-building. You can run a weekly quiz on a fun or interesting article to foster a more interactive and connected team environment in Slack.The primary impact is efficiency and engagement. It saves managers and team leads significant time by automating the creation of learning materials. More importantly, it transforms passive reading into an active, collaborative, and fun experience, which significantly boosts information retention and team participation.Huge thanks to Dev and Runner H Team for this hackathon! I really enjoyed participating.

Volatility reigns, narratives shift in days, and manual rebalancing can cost you hard-earned gains. If you’re serious about optimizing your asset allocation, leveraging automation is key—and that starts with choosing the best crypto API to power it.The Token Metrics API isn’t just another data feed—it’s a full intelligence engine that supports automated portfolio strategies across trading bots, wealth dashboards, and DeFi platforms. And yes, its free crypto API tier provides everything needed to get started.Let’s explore how Token Metrics is leading the charge in portfolio automation, and why it’s considered the best crypto data API for builders and traders alike.Why Portfolio Automation Demands More Than Price Data
Traditional automation relies on fixed benchmarks—price thresholds or simple moving averages. But today’s crypto market demands dynamic, strategy-aware systems that can adapt to new information instantly. To truly automate portfolios, you need:
Asset-level quality scoresReal-time momentum signalsComparative performance dataSector & narrative awarenessMost APIs give you the first item: prices. Token Metrics delivers them all—making it the top data API for anyone serious about automation.Trader vs Investor Grades: Auto-Adjusting Exposure
Imagine a rebalancer that:
Increases exposure to high-quality tokensReduces risk on weakening assetsAdjusts based on both momentum and fundamentalsWith Token Metrics API, this is entirely possible:
Trader Grades trigger entry/exit rules aligned to short-term trendsInvestor Grades help reinforce confident long-term allocationsThe automation logic can weight assets dynamically according to changing gradesIt’s like having a quant portfolio manager—programmed, intelligent, and tireless.Signal Integration: Automate Trades When Momentum Aligns
Token Metrics signals aren’t just informative—they’re actionable.
Bullish signals can trigger buy ordersBearish signals can trigger partial sells or stop-loss adjustmentsAutomated systems can use API endpoints to:
Scan each morning for current signalsEnter or exit positions as signals changeAllocate capital to sectors with the strongest momentumThis signal-based approach elevates your system beyond static rules into responsive, intelligent automation.Signal ROI vs Holding ROI: Smarter Risk Management
A key pillar of Token Metrics is comparing Signal ROI versus Holding ROI for each token. This data empowers savvy portfolio automation to:Prioritize assets where trading derived more profit than holdingRotate out of tokens where passive holding is actually betterDynamically shift focus between actively managed and “sleeping” assetsThat insight helps your automated allocations stay adaptive, not just scheduled.Sector & Narrative Performance: Focus Your Capital
Portfolios that diversify across sectors are smarter and safer, especially when those sectors are trending. With the Token Metrics API you can:Identify and allocate more capital to trending narratives (AI, RWAs, DeFi, etc.)Reduce allocation to fading sectors showing bearish signalsDynamically adjust portfolio composition daily or weekly based on sector momentumThis sector-aware automation strategy is impossible to execute with standard price-only APIs.Free Crypto API + Enterprise-Level Scalability
Token Metrics serves both solo developers and enterprise platforms with:
A zero-cost free crypto data API tier (core signals, grades, sector tags)Premium enterprise access including full data depth, call volume, and SLAsEasy integration for custom platforms, mobile apps, bots, and hedge fund toolsThat flexibility makes it the top data API for scalable portfolio automation.Use Cases Unlocking Smart Automation
Here are real-world ways builders use Token Metrics API:
Self-Rebalancing PortfoliosAutomatically rebalance to top 10 tokens by combined grades each week.Above threshold grade → increase exposure; bearish signal → partially exit.Shift capital among narratives automatically (e.g., from Memes to AI).Keeper assets with high Investor Grades + rotational trading signals.Increase position size in high Signal ROI tokens and reduce in low-ROI ones.Why Token Metrics Outpaces Other APIs
Other market data providers may give prices, volume, or historical hikes. But only Token Metrics offers:
AI signals updated hourly and dailyTrader/Investor grading for each tokenSignal vs Holding ROI metricsTailored sector tags for trend rotationFree plan with full intelligence, ready for automationThat’s what makes it the best crypto API in the world for portfolio builders—intelligence-driven automation is built-in.Final Thoughts
Smart portfolio automation doesn’t start with a threshold—it starts with continuous intelligence. Token Metrics provides that foundation, giving builders the tools to automate portfolios based on strategy, sentiment, momentum, and risk.If you're building trading platforms, wealth dashboards, DeFi protocols, or automated managers, remember: the best crypto data API for your logic isn’t just about prices—it’s about performance insight. Start for free, and extend with confidence as your platform grows.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From Signals to Strategy: How Token Metrics Helps You Win Daily in 2025</title><link>https://dev.to/crypto-trader/from-signals-to-strategy-how-token-metrics-helps-you-win-daily-in-2025-39g3</link><author>Crypto Trader</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 22:07:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Winning in crypto isn’t about catching one lucky trade—it’s about consistently making the right decisions based on the right information.

We were inspired by the lack of structured, accessible mentorship for students and early-career professionals. Many learners struggle to find the right guidance at the right time. With AI advancing rapidly, we saw an opportunity to build a smarter mentorship platform that goes beyond human limitations and offers scalable, personalized support.What it does
MentorSpace connects mentees with mentors through a smart platform that uses AI to match individuals based on skills, interests, and goals. It includes features like personalized learning plans, goal tracking, and asynchronous communication. Our long-term vision is to minimize dependency on in-person mentorship by leveraging AI-driven systems that can guide and support students autonomously.How we built it
MentorSpace was built using React and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, with a backend powered by Node.js and Firebase for authentication, real-time data, and secure storage. The AI-based matching system and planning tracker are being developed using machine learning models that analyze user input to deliver meaningful mentor matches and customized learning journeys.Challenges we ran into
Our biggest challenge was designing a truly effective AI-based mentoring experience. It required us to rethink traditional mentorship models and understand how AI can replicate or even improve parts of the human mentorship process. Integrating intelligent tracking tools and creating a smooth, supportive user experience also required constant iteration and feedback.Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re proud of how far MentorSpace has come from a simple idea to a platform that’s aiming to reinvent mentorship using AI. We've built a working prototype with core functionality, and we’ve received positive feedback from early testers. Seeing the concept evolve and gain real traction has been incredibly rewarding.What we learned
We learned how a project can evolve and reshape your thinking as you build it. Originally, we just wanted to help students find mentors — but as we explored possibilities, we realized that AI could play a much larger role. We didn’t have a detailed plan at first, but through research and testing, we discovered how AI could enable mentorship to scale in a meaningful way.What's next for MentorSpace
Next, we’re focused on expanding MentorSpace by integrating online meeting capabilities, refining our AI matching algorithm, and improving the AI-based learning tracker. We want to ensure each student gets the most relevant mentor and consistent guidance throughout their journey. We also aim to expand into global markets and build partnerships with schools, universities, and professional communities to reach a wider audience.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Now available: Claude Code sessions in Depot</title><link>https://dev.to/depot/now-available-claude-code-sessions-in-depot-33kd</link><author>Kyle Galbraith</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 21:01:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We're excited to launch Claude Code sessions for Depot. This enables seamless collaboration between AI coding agents and your team by allowing anyone in your organization to pick up and resume Claude sessions. Perfect for collaborating with Claude across your entire team and between your local & CI environments.Whether you're handing off a complex debugging session to a teammate, running an AI-assisted code review in CI, or continuing work started by an automated agent, Claude Code sessions make it easy to maintain context and momentum across your entire development workflow.
  
  
  What are Claude Code sessions for Depot?
With this latest command for the Depot CLI, you can now save, share, and resume conversations with Claude across your entire organization by using . Each session maintains full context—including conversation history, code changes, and project understanding—that can be picked up by any team member or automated process with the correct permissions.This transforms Claude from a personal coding assistant into a collaborative team resource. Sessions can flow seamlessly between: - Hand off work between human developers and automated Claude agents - Share complex problem-solving sessions across time zones and teamsLocal and CI environments - Start debugging locally and continue in CI, or vice versaDifferent stages of development - Maintain context from design through implementation to review
  
  
  How to use Claude Code sessions in Depot
Getting started with Claude Code sessions in Depot is simple. Just use the  command instead of the regular  command:
depot claude  feature-auth-redesign


depot claude  feature-auth-redesign


depot claude  pr-1234 
depot claude  debug-memory-leak  opus You can specify a custom session ID with , or use  to continue an existing session. If you don't specify a session ID, Depot will generate one for you.When you run , it will automatically save your session state, including conversation history and code context, to your Depot organization. This means you can pick up where you left off from any machine with access to your organization.You can also list all available sessions in your organization using the  command:depot claude list-sessions
From there, you can choose to resume any sessions by selecting the session from the list.Behind the scenes, the  command wraps the standard Claude Code CLI, automatically handling session persistence while passing through all Claude's native functionality. Sessions are uploaded when you exit, and can be resumed from any machine with access to your Depot organization.Internally, we've been collaborating on Claude Code sessions for the past month, and it's already transformed how we work. Here are some real-world examples of how we've been using this feature:Cross-timezone collaborationWe're a globally remote team, so handoffs between developers in different time zones are a common occurrence. We can easily collaborate with our other team members and include Claude in the collaboration via sessions.
depot claude  payment-integration


depot claude  payment-integration We've started looking at ways to integrate Claude into our code reviews. Anthropic already has some great actions around this, but we want to maintain context between the PR review and addressing the feedback locally. So, you can install Claude Code in your CI environment, tell it to do a code review while using the pull request number as the session ID, and then continue that session locally to address the feedback.
- name: Install Claude
  run: npm  @anthropic-ai/claude-code

- name: AI Code Review
  run: |
    depot claude  pr-Much like everyone else, we've found Claude particularly useful for debugging. Now we can start a debugging session connected to our internal MCP tools and then hand off the session to a teammate to continue working on it. This is especially useful for complex bugs that require multiple iterations to resolve.

depot claude  bug-user-sync-issue We're on a mission to make the entire software delivery lifecycle exponentially faster and more efficient. We are demonstrating that with our relentless focus on build performance across all of Depot. However, as we all know, the delivery pipeline encompasses more than builds. It also involves collaboration, debugging, code reviews, and more.AI tools are giving us a new tool in our toolbelt. The ability to rapidly iterate on ideas, problem solving, and functionality, without having to actually write all of it ourselves.But much like how CI providers were extremely ephemeral, underpowered, and siloed before Depot came along, AI coding agents are also limited in their ability to maintain context and collaborate effectively across teams and environments.This results in a number of challenges: when switching between local development and CI environments when multiple developers tackled similar problems without shared AI context because AI agents couldn't maintain state between runs where valuable problem-solving sessions were trapped on individual machinesWith Depot, we solve these problems by making AI conversation context a shared team resource, just like your codebase. This enables entirely new workflows where AI agents can work continuously on long-running tasks, hand off to humans for review, and pick up where they left off—all while maintaining full context.You can utilize Claude Code sessions in Depot regardless of the plan you are on. Every session is scoped to your organization, ensuring your code and conversations remain secure and private.We're already working on what's next, including more session state, enhanced tooling inside of agents, and even moving the agent into different environments.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Reference Architecture for Team AI Productivity</title><link>https://dev.to/leading-edje/reference-architecture-for-team-ai-productivity-1dpi</link><author>Matt Eland</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 20:58:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Let's discuss a sample reference architecture for providing a secure and convenient way for your organization to chat with pre-approved AI capabilities.Previously in this series we discussed Website RAG Chat and Developer AI Productivity reference architectures. Those architectures are valid and helpful for delivering rich AI capabilities to your customers and developer team, but what about the rest of your organization?In this article we'll lay out a reference architecture that allows different members of your organization to safely enhance their workflows through AI, and do so with the knowledge that organizational data is being handled securely and intellectual property is being respected.While this architecture could work using a variety of different technologies, specific examples and screenshots will feature the popular Open WebUI conversational AI platform.You may not immediately think that providing a team-wide AI system would be extremely helpful, but when we unveiled our "Chat EDJE" conversational AI solution at Leading EDJE we noticed some immediate and profound impacts on our teams for all types of users.While developers were excited about these capabilities and took advantage of them for complex tasks like working on improving SQL performance by comparing a complex query with an execution plan, we also saw some tremendous benefits for non-developers.We saw project managers gain access to ways to generate new ideas relevant for the teams they were on, web designers able to gain access to specialized insights for technical search engine optimization (SEO) considerations, analysts able to help quickly find and fix anomalies in data, and all team members benefitted from summarization and email drafting / proof checking capabilities.While we weren't initially sure that AI tooling would truly help all team members, we continue to be blown away by the impact of secure, reliable, AI tooling applied to the entire organization and governed by the organization's IT staff.Let's talk about how this works.A team productivity conversational web AI chat architecture consists of the following required components:A  for hosting the conversationsOne or more registered  that makes public or private conversational AI models (typically LLMs) available to the teamA  allowing administrators to configure and control the modelConversational web AI chat architectures may also include the following optional components:A  for storing past conversation sessionsA  that provides additional documents, tools, or capabilities that can augment the conversationLet's walk through each of these required and optional components, talk about what they are and the various choices you might need to make with each one.The first component is the most obvious: you need a centralized  where users can go to ask questions of your system. This typically looks like a web page hosted on your organization's intranet or on the internet and is secured via your organization's preferred authentication options.The web chat portal allows you to select a prior conversation to continue (if a persistence layer is present) or start a new conversation.When starting a new conversation, users must select a model to interact with from the approved list of models, specify a textual query / prompt, and optionally include documents, files, or web links to act as additional sources of context before sending the message.Your web chat portal  stream the completions your model provides so the user can see the response in real-time, but once the response is fully complete it should show up in your portal and include additional context, links, and feedback mechanisms.Some web chat portals may also support asking the same question of multiple models to compare their responses or may give you the ability to edit your existing messages and resend them to regenerate a response.It's important to know that when a persistence layer is present, entire interactions with the system may be stored temporarily or permanently for auditing or quality control purposes. This is particularly true when users provide positive or negative feedback. As a result, users should be informed that their conversations may be stored and retrieved by your organization's IT staff or potentially other personnel and the system should therefore be treated with the same level of professionalism as you would expect from a communications platform like Slack, Teams, or Discord.A  is a connector that connects your web chat portal to organizationally approved large language models (LLMs) that users are allowed to interact with.Your organization may use public models like those deployed on OpenAI, instanced / dedicated models hosted on a service like Azure, or your team may self-host models using something like Ollama or LM Studio. Your team could even use a combination of these by specifying multiple model providers.Your list of approved models will grow and shrink over time as new models arrive, are reviewed and approved, and as older models get retired and replaced with newer ones. The most important thing to remember with your model selection is that you only list models your organization is comfortable with people using.  If a model does not meet your organization's IP security needs (for example, it retains logs for training future models), it should not appear in your list of models to your end users. In this way, users working with your solution know that they are in compliance with organizational AI policies.You may wonder "why don't organization's just use a single approved model? Why give user choices?". While providing choices to users may raise the barrier to entry slightly for some users, the overall benefits of having different models is usually worth it. Because different models are good at different tasks and have different basic characteristics in terms of speed, accuracy, and cost, it can be helpful to allow your users to choose.Additionally, you may find that some models temporarily go offline - particularly if you're using multiple model providers - and it can be helpful to have backup resources for people to consider.Most AI chat solutions have some form of management or configuration associated with them. The  allows your IT admin team to configure your web chat system and connect it to various models and other providers.Once model providers are configured, you can also select the various models from your model providers that should be available to your users:Organizations using pay-per-usage models can sometimes use the management layer to limit the budget of individual users in order to ensure a predictable maximum expense per week per user limit.Most web portals with a management layer will also have some form of a  that allows storing past conversations. This is done for convenience for users who which to refer to past conversations or resume them and can also help your organization's IT team manage and monitor its AI infrastructure.In evaluating models and compliance, admins may be able to see some or all of the private interactions with users, depending on how the persistence layer is configured and if any rolling delete or anonymization capabilities are present. While this helps evaluate which models are actively being used and how they're performing, this capability and how it may be used should be disclosed to your employees as some employees may include context they intended to be private in even legitimate interactions with the system. For example, an employee brainstorming a presentation with an LLM may choose to disclose private medical information about physical or mental conditions that might impact their performance in order to perform their company-assigned tasks more effectively.Your persistence layer could be as simple as a series of configuration files, or it could be a relational or document database. Some persistence layers may even use a vector store to store text embeddings allowing for searching past conversations or indexed documents. The capabilities of your persistence layer vary based on the overall solution you're using and will be strongly tied to whatever solution you choose.Perhaps the most exciting of all the parts of an AI solution is the . The context layer is able to provide your LLM with additional knowledge and capabilities including: that can be called to produce a result. Some tool examples might involve checking current weather in an area, tracking a package that's out for delivery, or searching the internet. define common text instructions for carrying out a task in a way that helps multiple people on your team such as documents, web pages, and additional pieces of information that can help provide additional context.When a user sends a request to the LLM, these additional capabilities will also be sent along to the LLM and it  choose to take advantage of them in order to fulfill the user's request. This makes these additional capabilities a form of a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) data source.By integrating additional tools and capabilities into your AI systems, you are offering unique value for your organization that they cannot find in another tool. These capabilities are your unique way of adding in additional context to your organization that will help employees do their jobs more effectively. This context can include: of looking up the status of different work items, orders, or customers documenting standard definitions, systems, and workflows that help generate output that's consistent with organizational branding or work standardsIn short, the context layer is something that is uniquely yours and can be uniquely controlled by your organization.These capabilities can be so valuable that some organizations even offer a shared architecture that encapsulates these tools into a MCP server that is shared between the web AI chat tooling and individual developer productivity solutions as shown here:In this way all employees can take advantage of organizational knowledge, standards, and capabilities when performing their work, regardless of what that work entails.Some web AI chat systems may include additional integrations including:Text to speech capabilities that read aloud responses from the systemSpeech to text capabilities that allow you to talk to your LLMImage generation via ComfyUI, OpenAI, Gemini, or other providersWeb search capabilities (essentially a built-in tool provided by your platform)Direct code execution capabilities in sandboxed environmentsThis list of capabilities will vary depending on what web chat provider you selected and will change over time as industry trends evolve.
  
  
  Securing your chat provider
While providing your users with a curated list of models is fantastic for helping users interact with AI in approved ways, these same capabilities can be a target for attackers as well.If you do not properly secure your AI web chat capabilities it is possible that an attacker can discover your endpoint and use it to cause damage such as:Incurring charges against pay-per-use AI modelsConduct a denial of service attack against your AI models by attempting to exhaust your rate limit capabilities for certain LLMs, denying legitimate users access to these resourcesAccess sensitive information stored in prompts or resourcesExploit tools to perform additional attacks such as searching your knowledgebase, querying data stores, or other actions dependent on the exact nature of your implemented toolsThere are a number of ways of remedying these vulnerabilities including:Properly researching the various web AI chat providers to ensure they meet your security and administration needsRequiring users to log in via an API key, LDAP, or some other form of authenticationConfiguring firewall rules to require a VPN to access AI toolingSetting sensible rate limiting or access permission on groups of users so a single compromised user cannot inflict massive damage to the organizationWhile any new system carries new attack vectors for malicious users, one of the realities of a world where AI tools are ubiquitous is that your users will find AI tooling that meets their needs. Your goal as an organization should be to make sure that when they do this, they do it in an approved way that also meets the organization's data stewardship and security needs.Conversational AI systems are powerful ways of augmenting your entire team's capabilities, and a web AI chat portal is an effective way to provide a secure means for your organization to innovate with AI in approved and cost-effective ways. What's more, the ability to integrate your organization's context through resources, prompts, and tools is an offering that no other AI chat toolset will provide - and it can be easily integrated into other solutions such as developer AI productivity architectures.We've been amazed at the things our team at Leading EDJE has been able to do with properly governed AI - both internally and for our clients - and we'd love to discuss how you can move forward with AI.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Find the best prompts</title><link>https://dev.to/godtierprompts/find-the-best-prompts-2lia</link><author>God Tier Prompts</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 20:49:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I built the ultimate battleground for prompt engineers.

A unified development environment consolidates data processing, model development, and AI application deployment into a single system. This integration streamlines workflows, enhances collaboration, and accelerates AI solution development from concept to production.The next generation of Amazon SageMaker is the center for your data, analytics, and AI. SageMaker brings together AWS AI/ML and analytics capabilities and delivers an integrated experience for analytics and AI with unified access to data. Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio is a single data and AI development environment where you can find and access your data and act on it using AWS analytics and AI/ML services, for SQL analytics, data processing, model development, and generative AI application development.In this post, we demonstrate how you can use SageMaker Unified Studio to create complex AI workflows using Amazon Bedrock Flows.Consider FinAssist Corp, a leading financial institution developing a generative AI-powered agent support application. The solution offers the following key features:Complaint reference system – An AI-powered system providing quick access to historical complaint data, enabling customer service representatives to efficiently handle customer follow-ups, support internal audits, and aid in training new staff.Intelligent knowledge base – A comprehensive data source of resolved complaints that quickly retrieves relevant complaint details, resolution actions, and outcome summaries.Streamlined workflow management – Enhanced consistency in customer communications through standardized access to past case information, supporting compliance checks and process improvement initiatives.Flexible query capability – A straightforward interface supporting various query scenarios, from customer inquiries about past resolutions to internal reviews of complaint handling procedures.Let’s explore how SageMaker Unified Studio and Amazon Bedrock Flows, integrated with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases and Amazon Bedrock Agents, address these challenges by creating an AI-powered complaint reference system. The following diagram illustrates the solution architecture.The solution uses the following key components:– Provides the development environment – Orchestrates the workflow, including: 
  Prompt-based classificationAgent-based response generationThe workflow processes user queries through the following steps:A user submits a complaint-related question.The knowledge base provides relevant complaint information.The prompt classifies if the query is about resolution timing.Based on the classification using the condition, the application takes the following action: 
  Routes the query to an AI agent for specific resolution responses.Returns general complaint information.The application generates an appropriate response for the user.For this example, you need the following:The IAM user or IAM Identity Center user must have appropriate permissions for: 
  SageMaker Unified Studio.Amazon Bedrock (including Amazon Bedrock Flows, Amazon Bedrock Agents, Amazon Bedrock Prompt Management, and Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases).Configure access to your Amazon Bedrock serverless models for Amazon Bedrock in SageMaker Unified Studio projects.Amazon Titan Embedding (for the knowledge base).Sample complaint data prepared in CSV format for creating the knowledge base.We have created a sample dataset to use for Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases. This dataset has information of complaints received by customer service representatives and resolution information.The following is an example from the sample dataset:complaint_id,product,sub_product,issue,sub_issue,complaint_summary,action_taken,next_steps,financial_institution,state,submitted_via,resolution_type,timely_response

Within projects, you can manage data assets in the SageMaker Unified Studio catalog, perform data analysis, organize workflows, develop ML models, build generative AI applications, and more.To create a project, complete the following steps:Open the SageMaker Unified Studio landing page using the URL from your admin.Enter a project name and optional description.For , choose Generative AI application development.Complete your project configuration, then choose .Let’s create a reusable prompt to capture the instructions for FMs, which we will use later while creating the flow application. For more information, see Reuse and share Amazon Bedrock prompts.In SageMaker Unified Studio, on the  menu, choose  under Machine Learning & Generative AI.Provide a name for the prompt.Choose the appropriate FM (for this example, we choose ).For , we enter the following:You are a complaint analysis classifier. You will receive complaint data from a knowledge base. Analyze the {{input}} and respond with a single letter:
T: If the input contains information about complaint resolution timing, response time, or processing timeline (whether timely or delayed)
F: For all other types of complaint information
Return only 'T' or 'F' based on whether the knowledge base response is about resolution timing. Do not add any additional text or explanation - respond with just the single letter 'T' or 'F'.Let’s create a chat agent to handle specific resolution responses. Complete the following steps:In SageMaker Unified Studio, on the  menu, choose  under Machine Learning & Generative AI.Provide a name for the prompt.Choose the appropriate FM (for this example, we choose ).For , we enter the following:You are a Financial Complaints Assistant AI. You will receive complaint information from a knowledge base and questions about resolution timing.
When responding to resolution timing queries:
1. Use the provided complaint information to confirm if it was resolved within timeline
2. For timely resolutions, provide:
   - Confirmation of timely completion
   - Specific actions taken (from the provided complaint data)
   - Next steps that were completed
2. For delayed resolutions, provide:
   - Acknowledgment of delay
   - Standard compensation package:
     • $75 service credit
     • Priority Status upgrade for 6 months
     • Service fees waived for current billing cycle
   - Actions taken (from the provided complaint data)
   - Contact information for follow-up: Priority Line: ************** 
Always reference the specific complaint details provided in your input when discussing actions taken and resolution process.After the agent is saved, choose .For , enter .Now that we have our prompt and agent ready, let’s create a flow that will orchestrate the complaint handling process:In SageMaker Unified Studio, on the  menu, choose  under Machine Learning & Generative AI.Create a new flow called demo-flow.Add a knowledge base to your flow applicationComplete the following steps to add a knowledge base node to the flow:In the navigation pane, on the tab, choose .On the  tab, provide the following information:

It evaluates whether a query is about resolution timing or general complaint information, enabling the flow to route the query appropriately. When a query is about resolution timing, it will be directed to the chat agent for specialized handling; otherwise, it will receive a direct response from the knowledge base. Complete the following steps to add a condition:Add a chat agent to your flow applicationNow let’s add the chat agent you created earlier to the flow:Test the flow applicationNow that the flow application is ready, let’s test it. On the right side of the page, choose the expand icon to open the  pane.In the  text box, we can ask a few questions related to the dataset created earlier. The following screenshots show some examples.To clean up your resources, delete the flow, agent, prompt, knowledge base, and associated OpenSearch Serverless resources.In this post, we demonstrated how to build an AI-powered complaint reference system using a flow application in SageMaker Unified Studio. By using the integrated capabilities of SageMaker Unified Studio with Amazon Bedrock features like Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, Amazon Bedrock Agents, and Amazon Bedrock Flows, you can rapidly develop and deploy sophisticated AI applications without extensive coding.As you build AI workflows using SageMaker Unified Studio, remember to adhere to the AWS Shared Responsibility Model for security. Implement SageMaker Unified Studio security best practices, including proper IAM configurations and data encryption. You can also refer to Secure a generative AI assistant with OWASP Top 10 mitigation for details on how to assess the security posture of a generative AI assistant using OWASP TOP 10 mitigations for common threats. Following these guidelines helps establish robust AI applications that maintain data integrity and system protection.We look forward to seeing the innovative solutions you will create with these powerful new features. is an Enterprise Support Lead (TAM) at AWS in North Carolina.

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers make this possible, and they're surprisingly simple to build and use!You may have already seen my videos and posts on using the Playwright MCP to go to a website and generate test ideas and then generate actual Playwright tests after first interacting with the site. Or how I used it to go shopping for me. This is the power of MCPs. It gives the AI agents tools to be able to do things such as connect to a browser or as in the GitHub MCP, create pull requests etc. In this tutorial, you'll create a weather server that connects AI agents like GitHub Copilot to live weather data. We will use TypeScript for this demo but you can build MCP servers in other languages, links at the end of the post. By the end, you'll be able to ask your AI for weather information in any city and get real, up-to-date responses.How to build an MCP server from scratch using the TypeScript SDKConnect it to a real weather APIIntegrate it with VS Code and GitHub CopilotTest and debug your serverBasic TypeScript/JavaScript knowledgeNode.js installed on your machineVS Code (optional, but recommended)Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers are bridges that connect AI agents to external tools and data sources. Think of them as translators that help AI understand and interact with real-world applications. When you ask GitHub Copilot for weather information in VS Code, you'll get a response like this:"I don't have access to real-time weather data or weather APIs through the available tools in this coding environment." MCP servers provide the missing link, giving AI agents the tools they need to access live data and perform real actions.Our weather server will act as a tool that any MCP-compatible AI can call to get current weather information for any city worldwide.Let's create a new project and set up our development environment.
  
  
  1. Initialize the Project
Create a new directory and initialize it with npm:mcp-weather-server
mcp-weather-server
npm init Create our main TypeScript file:
  
  
  3. Configure Package.json
Open the project in VS Code (or your preferred editor) and modify  to enable ES modules by adding the  field: The MCP SDK uses modern JavaScript modules, so we need to enable them in our project.
  
  
  Step 2: Install Dependencies
Our MCP server needs two key libraries:The Model Context Protocol SDK provides everything needed to build MCP servers:npm  @modelcontextprotocol/sdk

  
  
  2. Install Zod for Data Validation
Zod ensures our server receives valid data from AI agents:Your  dependencies should now look like this:
  
  
  Step 3: Building the Basic Server
Now let's create our MCP server. Open  and let's build it step by step.
  
  
  1. Add the Required Imports

  
  
  2. Create the Server Instance
The server manages all communication using the MCP protocol between clients (like VS Code) and your tools.
  
  
  3. Define Your First Tool
Tools are functions that AI agents can call. Let's create a  tool:Breaking down the tool definition: - Unique identifier Helps AI agents understand what this tool does Defines parameters (city must be a string) The actual code that runs when calledAI agent sees: "Tool to get the weather of a city"AI agent calls it with: Function returns: "The weather in Paris is sunny"Finally, we need to set up how our server communicates with AI clients: uses your terminal's input/output for communicationPerfect for local developmentThe server reads requests from  and writes responses to MCP protocol handles all the message formatting automatically
  
  
  5. Complete Basic Server Example
Your complete  should now look like this:🎉  You've built your first MCP server. Let's test it!
  
  
  Step 4: Testing with MCP Inspector
Before adding real weather data, let's test our server using the MCP Inspector, a web-based debugging tool for MCP servers.Run this command to open the MCP Inspector for your server:npx  @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx  tsx main.ts 
After running the command, you'll see terminal output with:A localhost URL (like )A direct link with the token pre-filled Click the link with the token already included to avoid manual entry. Click the "Connect" button in the Inspector Click "Tools" in the top navigation Choose your  tool Enter a city name (like "Palma de Mallorca") and click "Run Tool"You should see the response: "The weather in Palma de Mallorca is sunny" Make sure you used the link with the pre-filled tokenPerfect! Your MCP server is working. Now let's make it actually useful.
  
  
  Step 5: Adding Real Weather Data
Time to make our server actually useful! We'll integrate with Open-Meteo, a free weather API that requires no API key.
  
  
  How the Weather API Works
To get weather data, we need a two-step process:Convert city name → coordinates (using the Geocoding API)Get weather using coordinates (using the Weather API)
  
  
  Update Your Tool Function
Replace your existing tool function with this enhanced version: your MCP Inspector (Ctrl+C, then re-run the command) in the web interface with a real city like "Tokyo" or "New York"You should now see actual weather data instead of "sunny"! 🌤️
  
  
  Step 6: Integration with VS Code and GitHub Copilot
Now let's connect your weather server to VS Code so you can use it with GitHub Copilot! "Local server using stdio"This creates a  file in your project: Click the "Start" button next to your server name in the MCP panel You should see "Running" status Click the Copilot sidebar → "Agent Mode" "What's the weather like in Tokyo?"GitHub Copilot will ask permission to use your weather tool, click "Continue" to proceed. Instead of raw JSON, you'll get a beautifully formatted weather report like this: The AI transforms your raw weather data into a beautiful, human-readable format automatically.Your weather server demonstrates the true power of MCP:🤖 AI Does the Heavy LiftingYou provide raw data, AI creates beautiful presentationsNo need to format responses, the AI handles user experience🔗 Universal CompatibilityWorks with any MCP-compatible tool (VS Code, Claude, etc.)Write once, use everywhereAlways current data, no caching issuesWorks seamlessly within your development environmentAdd weather alerts, forecasts, or air quality dataBuild additional tools in the same serverHere's your final  file:
  
  
  Next Steps: Enhance Your Server
Ready to take your weather server to the next level? Here are some ideas:
  
  
  🚀 Additional Weather Tools
 Make it available for others to use🎉  You've successfully built your first MCP weather server!What You've Accomplished:✅ Created a functional MCP server from scratch✅ Integrated real-time weather data from an external API✅ Connected it to VS Code and GitHub Copilot✅ Learned the fundamentals of the Model Context Protocol MCP servers are much easier to build than they appear Real data makes AI interactions dramatically more valuable
 The same server works across multiple AI platforms You're building the infrastructure for next-gen AI The possibilities are endless! Weather was just the beginning, now you can connect AI to databases, APIs, file systems, and any service you can imagine.

Not difficult, just unnecessarily manual.That’s when I realized I didn’t want to build another product just for the sake of the hackathon. I wanted to build something that I would actually use, something would solve a real business problem.So I scrapped my original idea and started working on a spreadsheet that behaves more like an assistant. One where I could type plain language and get back working formulas, insights, or even full summaries without needing to remember exact syntax or jump between tabs.That’s how  started.Once I committed to the idea, I had around 15 days left in the World's Largest Hackathon presented by Bolt. To move quickly, I relied on Bolt.new to scaffold most of the application — from UI components to basic functionality.Almost every major feature started with a Bolt prompt."Create a React spreadsheet grid with editable cells""Add a formula bar which will for now contain the cell value""Add a toolbar with basic formatting like color, bg, alignments""Add CSV import/export support"Bolt helped me move fast, especially when I broke down prompts into focused tasks. Larger prompts often generated bloated or buggy code, so I kept things small and stitched the parts together manually.When Bolt-generated output broke existing logic or styling, I cleaned it up myself. I avoided over-engineering and left out anything that wasn't essential.
  
  
  🧠 Prompt Strategy and Workflow
My workflow eventually settled into this loop:Write a clear, single-purpose promptLet Bolt generate a scaffoldPatch or rewrite the pieces that brokeBy keeping each step tight, I avoided the usual AI-overhead and kept things predictable. This approach worked well — especially when combining AI-generated logic with my own cleanup. is a lightweight spreadsheet app with built-in AI support — designed to make working with data faster and less manual.Here’s what it currently supports:Formula generation from plain text
Type something like "Sum column B if column C is complete" and it returns a working  formula.Sheet-level changes via prompt
You can ask it to delete rows, add columns, or clean up sections without touching any menu.Natural language insights
Ask questions like "Which product had the highest revenue?" or "How many users signed up last week?" — and it gives you answers based on the data in the sheet.Auto-generated summary reports

Joe here. As someone who's been knee-deep in the AI world for years, I've seen my fair share of "revolutionary" AI announcements. But when Tencent (yes, the company behind WeChat) dropped Hunyuan-A13B last week, I knew I had to dig deep and give you the real scoop.
After spending countless hours testing this beast and diving through their research papers, I can tell you one thing: this isn't just another AI model. This is the kind of release that makes ChatGPT, Claude, and even the latest open-source darlings sweat a little.
What Makes This AI Different? Let Me Break It Down
Imagine you're running a restaurant. Most AI models are like having a massive kitchen with 100 chefs, but only 20 are actually cooking while the other 80 stand around doing nothing. Wasteful, right?
Hunyuan-A13B is different. It's like having a smart kitchen where only the chefs you need for each specific dish jump into action. Technically, it has 80 billion "parameters" (think of these as the AI's brain cells), but it only uses 13 billion at any given time. This means it's incredibly efficient while still being powerful.
Why should you care? This efficiency means you can run advanced AI on your laptop instead of needing a supercomputer. Game changer.
The Memory That Actually Remembers
Here's something that'll blow your mind: most AI models forget what you said after a few pages of conversation. It's like talking to someone with severe short-term memory loss.
Hunyuan-A13B can remember and work with 256,000 words at once. To put that in perspective, that's like remembering an entire novel while having a conversation about it. I tested this by feeding it a 200-page technical manual and asking detailed questions about different sections – it nailed every single one.
Real-world impact:Upload your entire codebase and get meaningful insights
Analyze complete research papers or legal documents
Have genuinely long conversations without the AI "forgetting" earlier partsTwo Brains Are Better Than One
This is where things get really interesting. Hunyuan-A13B has what I call "dual-mode thinking." It's like having both a quick-thinking friend and a deep-thinking philosopher in one package.
When you ask simple questions like "What's the weather like?" it responds instantly. But when you throw complex problems at it – like "Help me architect a distributed system for handling 1 million concurrent users" – it switches to deep-thinking mode and really works through the problem.
I tested this with everything from basic coding questions to complex system design problems. The AI literally adapts its thinking style based on what you're asking. It's honestly pretty remarkable.
Show Me The Numbers (The Benchmark Breakdown)
Look, I'm a developer. I don't care about marketing fluff – I want hard data. So I put Hunyuan-A13B through its paces against the current champions:Solved 84% of Python programming problems (that's better than most junior developers I've worked with)
Handled complex coding challenges that usually trip up other AI modelsScored 89% on complex reasoning tasks
Outperformed both Qwen (China's previous AI champion) and DeepSeek (the current open-source favorite)Mathematical Problem Solving:Consistently solved university-level math problems
Handled everything from calculus to statistics with impressive accuracyThe kicker? It did all this while using less computational power than its competitors.
But Can You Actually Use It? (The Reality Check)
Here's where most "revolutionary" AI models fall flat – they're either too expensive, too complicated, or require a NASA-level computer setup.
Hunyuan-A13B? I got it running on my laptop in about 30 minutes. No joke.Individual developers: You can experiment with cutting-edge AI without breaking the bank
Small startups: Access to enterprise-level AI capabilities without enterprise-level costs
Students and researchers: Finally, a powerful AI model you can actually afford to runReal-World Testing: Where I Put It Through Its Paces
Over the past week, I've been using Hunyuan-A13B for my actual work. Here's what impressed me:
Code Review: I fed it a messy 5,000-line JavaScript project. It not only identified bugs but suggested architectural improvements and even rewrote problematic functions.
Technical Writing: Asked it to help write API documentation. The output was so good, I barely had to edit it.
Problem Solving: Threw complex system design questions at it. The solutions were thoughtful, practical, and showed real understanding of trade-offs.
Learning Assistant: Used it to understand advanced concepts in machine learning. It explained things clearly without dumbing them down.
The Open Source Advantage (Why This Matters More Than You Think)
Unlike ChatGPT or Claude, which are locked behind company walls, Hunyuan-A13B is completely open source. This means:You own it: Once you download it, it's yours. No monthly subscriptions, no usage limits.
You can modify it: Want to fine-tune it for your specific use case? Go for it.
No data concerns: Everything runs on your hardware. Your code, documents, and conversations stay private.
Community innovation: Thousands of developers will be improving and extending it.The Competition: How Does It Stack Up?
I've been using ChatGPT since day one, Claude for serious work, and various open-source models for experimentation. Here's my honest take:
vs ChatGPT: Hunyuan-A13B matches ChatGPT in most tasks while being free and private. ChatGPT still has the edge in creative writing, but it's close.
vs Claude: Claude is still better for nuanced conversations and complex analysis, but Hunyuan-A13B wins on technical tasks and efficiency.
vs Other Open Source Models: This isn't even close. Hunyuan-A13B blows away previous open-source options in almost every category.
What This Means for the Future
As someone who's watched the AI space evolve, this release feels significant. We're moving from an era where advanced AI was locked behind expensive APIs to one where anyone with a decent computer can access cutting-edge capabilities.
This democratization of AI is going to accelerate innovation in ways we can't even predict yet. Small teams will be able to build things that previously required Google-sized resources.
Want to try it yourself? Here's what you need:A computer with at least 16GB RAM (32GB recommended)
A decent graphics card (though it can run on CPU)
About 50GB of storage spaceHead to the GitHub repository (link below)

One of the world’s largest software companies is evolving how it deploys AI within its products. With this evolution comes a host of new considerations for frontend developers and UX designers. Hundreds of millions of users globally access their digital lives daily through iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, and other Apple devices. With such a vast and engaged user base, understanding and leveraging Apple's unique approach to AI is paramount for creating future-forward, relevant, and compelling app experiences. Now this shift requires appropriate reflection in the mindset when it comes to designing new modern web applications. In this article, we will:  Explore the core features of the Apple Intelligence update  Discuss do’s and don’ts for designing with Apple Intelligence in mind  Reflect on what Apple Intelligence means for the future of AI design
  
  
  What exactly is Apple Intelligence?
Before going further, let’s first understand what Apple Intelligence is and what kind of AI it is. We’re used to chatbots. They’re almost synonymous with the idea of artificial intelligence in the minds of many people. Many have suggested that Apple was lagging behind in the AI race. Instead of coming up with a new chatbot, Apple is positioning AI as more of an ambient entity: an assistant that’s present all the time. Apple Intelligence is not a chatbot app that you open, ask questions, and get responses; it’s directly integrated into your Apple device. It’s context-aware and can assist you with tasks. Now, AI can help you reply to emails directly, record conversations and give summaries, react and operate on what’s seen on the phone’s screen, etc. Apple Intelligence does this directly on-device most of the time. We say most of the time, because there are other options like extending the capabilities via using Private Cloud Compute or directly interacting with ChatGPT. With these advancements come privacy questions. On-device AI usage is private, and Apple claims that Private Cloud Compute is private too.
  
  
  How Apple Intelligence is shifting UX
Now, with the latest release, we’ve learned that using the Foundation Models framework, developers can use embedded intelligence even offline. This is big, and it requires a shift in how we should approach UX. AI is now embedded and can do things it hadn’t before; read the screen, access different apps, and chain together actions. Developers will need to approach their design in a more intent-based way. Now, apps might have to take into account what the user intends to do, rather than what is predefined by the dev team:
  
  
  Apple’s architecture and philosophy: Moving past chatbots
Apple’s AI feels more like a personal assistant than an answer-spitting AI we’re so used to now. Privacy is a prime concern here. In using the on-device AI, user data does not leave the device. Apple also stressed that the Private Compute Cloud functionality was private, as well. This functionality can also tap into ChatGPT if required. Here, you have to think about whether you want to present that specific information to the external LLM or not. This flexibility between private and more general approaches is a win for user choice and experience. Genmojis and image generation are another big selling point, as Apple continues to pursue personal exploration and expression through AI. Users are incentivized to have and create unique, personalized experiences. Here are three lessons that frontend developers can take from Apple's new innovations: – You can choose either very private, private, or 3rd party (not private)AI is not only about chatbots – It can act as a personal assistant, a helper, and someone who knows the context and can do complex tasksGenerative AI is here to stay – Apple strives to give users more room for creativity and personal expression (E.g. Genmojis)
  
  
  What are the key features of Apple Intelligence?
Apple Intelligence allows developers to benefit from Writing Tools, Genmoji, and Image Playground. Writing Tools help users rewrite, proofread, and summarize text, but it can also be customized according to the app’s needs. Genmoji allows users to generate a new emoji, which enables them to express their emotions more thoroughly. With Image Playground, apps can allow users to play with images using AI. For example, users can remove unwanted background elements. You can also go further with creating your own models. Here are a few of the highlights of the Apple Intelligence release:
  
  
  Foundation Models Framework
With Foundation Models Framework, you get direct access to the on-device LLM at the code of Apple Intelligence. By using Foundation Models, you can summarize text, extract text, classify it, generate new text, call specific tools in your app, and so on. One important thing to note is that this feature is available offline; it's free of charge for developers to use, and it has native support for Swift.Now with direct ChatGPT integration, users can interact with ChatGPT inside their apps. Each supporting Apple product comes with the ChatGPT free tier, so users don’t need to open an account for it. For premium models, users would need to log in to their accounts. The power of ChatGPT comes with a cost, though. While on-device processing and Private Cloud Computing stress privacy, giving user data to a third party is a whole different act. When designing applications, the developer team should inform the user what is shared with third parties, and when.Now AI can “see” the user’s screen and react to it. For example, a user might be browsing social media and they see a comedy show that they’d like to attend. Now, instead of taking a screenshot of the event, saving the details, and updating their calendar, the user will be able to ask AI to do that for them. This ubiquitousness of AI brings different design implications with it. Now, everything on the screen is subject to AI. It can look at images, alter them, find specific items in them, assess location based on background etc. To sum it up, Apple Intelligence can:  Remove unwanted elements from a photo’s background  Create new, custom images in seconds  Use the camera to get info and create appointments  Read and react to the device’s screen
  
  
  'Intent-based app design': Building with Apple Intelligence in mind
Building with Apple Intelligence in mind requires a shift in how we think of application design. We can describe this new way of thinking as “intent-based app design.” Instead of following a predefined set of actions, the user will express their intents in myriad ways and expect the applications to behave accordingly. To help illustrate the idea, let’s go over some hypothetical examples.The user opens your app to perform a task.User expresses an intent (verbally, through text, or even implicitly through context), and Apple Intelligence (via Siri or other system-level features) either fulfills that intent directly or suggests your app as the best tool for the job, with the relevant part of your app pre-loaded. An example could be a user taking a picture of their kid’s dance school schedule, and Apple Intelligence would take that picture and use the information it gathers from there to add the performance date to the user’s calendar. It’ll then send them reminder notifications before the event date. Another example could be Apple Intelligence making sure that the user never forgets their anniversary. The user’s intent could be something like “look through my phone, gather all information, and arrange my schedule accordingly.” In developing such applications, developers will be required to approach user privacy with extra care. Sensitive information should never be shared without the user’s consent.AI anticipates user needs before they ariseApps wait for user input.Apps, powered by Apple Intelligence, anticipate user needs based on context (location, time, calendar, communication, photos, etc.) and proactively offer relevant functionalities or information. Developers will have to consider how the app can "listen" to the user's environment and suggest relevant features before the user even thinks to open the app. This requires thinking about data privacy and user control. Like the previous example, the user may or may not be happy with the contents of their images being run through an LLM. On top of that, devs should be even more careful to inform their user about whether they want to make use of Private Cloud Computing, or tap into ChatGPT. For another example, think of a weather app that sends notifications to the user when it’s going to rain to remind them to bring their umbrellas with them.Your app's value is primarily contained within its own UI.Your app's valuable features are surfaced across the entire Apple ecosystem: in Siri, Spotlight, Messages, Mail, Notes, Photos, and even new "Smart Overlays" or "Visual Intelligence" capabilities. Example: Your app suggests Genmoji as the user types. Where will it work? Will it also work when writing emails as it does in chat messages? What kind of content can it suggest? Will there be contextual differences regarding different platforms and situations? Generative AI can be dangerous and create confusion.Gen AI brings unique design scenariosUsers create all content from scratch or select from pre-defined options.Apple Intelligence provides powerful generative capabilities (text, images, emojis, summaries, etc.) that users can leverage directly within your app or through system-wide tools. Think of a mobile game where the environment changes depending on where you are located. In this case, the game would create new backgrounds. Or, when interacting with characters, they wouldn’t say the same things all the time, but change their behavior depending on, say, current world events. In such a scenario, since the tone of the app is subject to change, developers will have to adapt the styling accordingly. Just adding a dark mode will not be enough anymore. Now that we have an understanding of how the design could shift for this new era of AI that connects and assists, let’s talk about some best practices and pitfalls to avoid.
  
  
  Best practices: Do’s and don’ts for designing with Apple Intelligence in mind
 The following best practices are not just good design principles; they represent crucial considerations for developers getting ready for this new era of the omnipresent, embedded, generative AI. Now that deeply integrated AI is at hand, with its on-device, offline processing and absolute privacy when needed, developers will face rather unique challenges. These recommendations strive to address the challenges and opportunities of the new era of omnipresent AI. Everyone who’ll dabble with the Foundation Models Framework, experiment with Visual Intelligence, and tap into ChatGPT features should take these into account: – Remember that users can give practically any prompt, something you’ve never considered before, and cause your AI app to behave in a very unexpected way.Help users maintain control – You are developing for the user, and the user should be in control. They should have the ability to dismiss, revert, or retry AI-produced content as they wish. - Keep in mind that AI models learn from data, and they tend to be in favor of the most common information, whether it represents the truth for all or not. The data that the model has been fed could create images about certain things that a certain group of people may not experience or think of as reality. Give people the ability to fine-tune their requests in these situations, and try to minimize assumptions about cultural subjects. - Do not force your users to use generative AI. They should have the choice to opt out. A concrete example is Genmoji and emojis. Users are not required to use Genmoji all the time; they can use good ol’ emojis whenever they want. - Let your user know and choose when they want to interact with AI. Never trick someone into thinking they’re interacting with or viewing content authored by a human if they’re actually interacting with AI. - Do not overpromise. Make sure your users understand what the feature can and cannot do. If they assume X will happen, but X is not a feature of your app, the user may get frustrated and lose confidence. This stems from a miscommunication between the developer and the user. Keep in mind that you should set expectations right. - On-device models are strong enough; favor them over server-based models. Why? Pros of on-device models are as follows:

  They’re private; computations stay on your device Always ask for the user’s permission when using their data. Let the user have full control over what they want to share and what they want to keep private. If they agree to share, give them the possibility to revoke that permission.Understand your model deeply - In developing your app, make sure you understand the underlying model well. If you don’t, your app might give subpar results. AI is still confusing for many. Remind your users that AI can hallucinate. Try to avoid using your apps to deal with factual information. New dialog generation would be way safer than a news notification app in terms of factuality.Handle permissions with care - Tread lightly on permissions. Your app should try to avoid committing changes that are hard to take back, like deleting pictures. Think about how you’ll implement and how you’d turn things around in the worst-case scenario.Implement robust safeguards - Remember that some people will try to break your app or get harmful content out of it. Try to sanitize your app as best as you can. Think about what would happen if AI fails at a given task. Will it just stop doing anything, or will it try to guide the user to re-prompt for better results?
  
  
  Big-picture reflections: What Apple Intelligence signals about the future of interface design
Like with many great innovations, we’re still in “wait and see” mode. However, Apple's WWDC announcement wasn't just another tech update; it was a foundational shift, signaling clear directions for the future of interface design that developers must understand and adapt to now. To understand the shift, we might need to think of the difference between the old, static websites of the 90s and today’s modern applications. Their content and capabilities foresaw the design mindset that is used towards them. A similar thing is happening with Apple’s understanding of AI. We can identify several key points that directly interact with our design approach:
  
  
  Chatbots are old news; Ambient Intelligence is the new standard
Apple decided to shift its attention from the chatbot race to integrating AI as an omnipresent, context-aware personal assistant. AI is not seen as an interactive encyclopedia but a helper that reads information, anticipate, and addresses pain points. This shift signals that future interfaces must prioritize intent-based interactions. In that way of thinking, the user’s goal drives the system.From on-device processing, where the data never leaves the device, to Private Cloud Compute, Apple shows that it takes privacy seriously. New design thinking should follow this decision.
  
  
  Personal expression and creativity with AI
With features like Genmoji and Image Playground, Apple brings generative AI into daily life. The easier it is to use something, the more people will use it. Since users can now create images that represent their input, developers should think about designing interfaces that beckon the user to experiment with AI: more creativity and more uniqueness. The more personal, the better.
  
  
  AI is integrated into the OS
Considering that via the Foundation Models Framework, AI can be used even offline, we are witnessing a shift in how AI is perceived. Apple is directly integrating the AI into their OS, which means that core features like Siri, Photos, Messages etc. can be used with AI, even offline! One thing that bears repeating is the interaction between AI (the robot), and the human. Now, in building applications, you’ll have to think about all the prompts the user (human) can give, and all the output the AI (the robot) provides in return. Things will go awry in the most unexpected ways, and developers and designers will need to think in broader terms. But overall, it’s nice to see we’re moving past the “only chatbots” stage of AI usage. Now AI can do more than just answer questions and write buggy code; it can be everywhere at once.
  
  
  Conclusion: Embracing the future of intelligent design
Apple Intelligence marks a pivotal moment, shifting AI from a siloed tool to an ambient, privacy-first assistant woven into the fabric of Apple platforms. For front-end developers and UX designers, this isn't just a new set of features; it's an invitation to redefine how users interact with technology. With direct access to on-device foundation models, powerful Writing Tools, and innovative Image Playground APIs, the opportunities to create truly intelligent, personalized, and intuitive experiences are immense and immediately available. Now is the time to explore and test these groundbreaking capabilities. Dive into the developer documentation, experiment with the new frameworks, and begin crafting the next generation of intelligent applications that seamlessly assist users while respecting their privacy. The future of interface design is here, and it's intelligent.

Others are convinced it's the beginning of the end.. that AI will replace developers.I don't think either extreme is fully right. But what I do know is that we've been here before. So many times.When frontend and backend frameworks started becoming the norm, a lot of devs pushed back. We heard things like:"Now anyone can build apps — we're so done""These frameworks are too opinionated — they take away the creativity""It's overcomplicating the simple stuff""Real developers write everything from scratch"Then what happened? We learned those frameworks. We mastered them. And in the process, we built better apps, in less time, with less guesswork. What seemed like a threat ended up unlocking a whole new level of impact.We saw the same kind of resistance when we moved away from jQuery. Or when SPAs started taking over. Or when TypeScript showed up and made JavaScript safer, some loved it, some hated it, but eventually most teams adopted it because the benefits were real.Now, we're looking at a new kind of shift.Concepts like MCPs (Model Context Protocol), RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), AI-assisted debugging, auto-generated tests, Vibe-coding, it became clear that AI isn't just a helper, it's becoming a real part of the dev workflow.Do I have it all figured out yet? Not really. I'm still exploring, still testing the limits.But what I do know for sure is that developers who stay curious, stay open, and keep learning, they won't be left behind. They'll lead.I'm collaborating with industry experts and top-tier developers to build a clear, structured path for learning how to truly leverage AI. The goal is to help developers make sense of this new landscape and use AI to work smarter, ship faster, and level up their efficiency in a big way.Because this isn't just another trend. It's a shift. And if history tells us anything, devs who embrace the shift early will be the ones who shape what comes next.Head over to https://aidd.io and fill out the quick survey, it'll help us shape the experience around what you actually need as a developer.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Use FederatedRouter to Switch Between GPT-4, Gemini, and Mistral in One AI Agent (Open Source)</title><link>https://dev.to/niral_bhalodia/use-federatedrouter-to-switch-between-gpt-4-gemini-and-mistral-in-one-ai-agent-open-source-3mfb</link><author>Niral Bhalodia</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 19:03:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Build a Voice-Powered Crypto AI Agent with Next.js + Google Gemini + LunarCrush MCP in 25 Minutes</title><link>https://dev.to/dbatson/build-a-voice-powered-crypto-ai-agent-with-nextjs-google-gemini-lunarcrush-mcp-in-25-minutes-5e6h</link><author>Danilo &quot;Jamaal&quot; Batson</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 18:51:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
  
  
  Build a Voice-Powered Crypto AI Agent with Next.js + Google Gemini + LunarCrush MCP in 25 Minutes
Transform cryptocurrency research with AI-powered voice interface and real-time market intelligence
  
  
  Why Voice + AI Changes Everything for Crypto Research
Traditional crypto analysis requires endless scrolling through charts, manually correlating social sentiment with price movements, and juggling multiple data sources. This creates significant cognitive overhead and research fatigue.Voice-powered AI with Model Context Protocol (MCP) revolutionizes how traders access real-time intelligence. Instead of manual research orchestration, AI intelligently combines voice commands with structured data connections to deliver instant, comprehensive insights.Voice AI with Model Context Protocol (MCP) revolutionizes how we interact with market data. Instead of manual orchestration across multiple APIs, MCP creates secure, standardized connections between AI models and real-time data sources. Your AI can intelligently orchestrate multiple data tools, make complex decisions, and generate insights that would take hours to code manually.This means you can literally ask "What's the sentiment on Bitcoin?" and get comprehensive analysis combining price data, social metrics, technical indicators, and AI insights—all through natural conversation.In this tutorial, you'll create a production-ready Voice Crypto Assistant that:✅  - Natural speech recognition for hands-free crypto research✅  - Google Gemini intelligently extracts cryptocurrency symbols from natural language✅  - Direct connection between Google Gemini AI and LunarCrush social intelligence tools✅  - Live analysis tracking through a multi-step AI pipeline✅ Interactive Visualizations - Beautiful Material-UI components with responsive design✅  - Voice selection, speed control, volume control, pause/resume✅  - Immediate edit functionality when voice recognition needs correction✅  - Dark theme optimized for trading and financial analysis✅  - AWS Amplify deployment with environment variable security 25 minutes Beginner to Intermediate Next.js, TypeScript, MCP integration, Voice APIs, AI orchestration, production deployment💡  By the end, you'll have a portfolio-worthy project that demonstrates modern AI development patterns with voice interfaces!Basic knowledge of React/TypeScript/Next.jsA code editor (VS Code recommended)Microphone access for voice features2 API keys from different services (we'll walk through signup below)Two Ways to Experience This Tutorial:

A patent invalidity search isn’t just another box to tick, it’s a strategic investigation designed to uncover prior art that can nullify a competitor’s claims. As technologies evolve, combining legal insight with AI-driven tools like XLSCOUT, PatentScan, and Traindex ensures no critical prior art goes unnoticed.
  
  
  Understanding Patent Invalidity Searches

  
  
  What is a Patent Invalidity Search?
A patent invalidity search is a focused investigation to find prior art that invalidates claims of an issued patent, often for litigation or licensing disputes.
  
  
  Legal Grounds for Invalidation
Lack of enablement or indefiniteness
  
  
  Importance of Non-Patent Literature (NPL)
Sources like academic papers, product manuals, and standards can be decisive. As Sagacious IP notes, NPL often provides the missing link that traditional patent searches overlook.Breaking claims into limitations and mapping technical terms is the foundation. Reviewing file wrappers helps identify claim amendments and possible weaknesses.
  
  
  Crafting a Winning Search Strategy
Define your scope by jurisdiction and technology, select tools like Espacenet and PatSeer, and balance depth and breadth carefully. PatentAttorneyWorldwide emphasizes using multiple sources for defensibility.
  
  
  Advanced Search Techniques

  
  
  Boolean and Keyword Strategies
Advanced queries help focus on highly relevant disclosures.
  
  
  Classification and Citation Analysis
Use CPC/IPC codes and analyze citations to catch related disclosures.
  
  
  Integrating AI and Modern Tools
AI platforms like XLSCOUT, PatentScan, and Traindex enable semantic analysis and fast identification of hidden prior art, enhancing manual efforts rather than replacing them.
  
  
  Exploring Non-Patent Literature
NPL includes journals, theses, and conference proceedings. Access barriers and language issues require diligence, but these sources can invalidate claims powerfully.Build detailed claim charts mapping each element to prior art. Assess technical and legal strength carefully.
  
  
  Preparing Invalidity Reports
Clear executive summaries, visuals, and claim charts are vital for decision-makers.Invalidity searches support litigation defense, counterclaims, licensing leverage, and freedom-to-operate evaluations.Avoid relying on one database, overlooking NPL, or blindly trusting AI outputs without expert review.Expect AI-based, multilingual, and graph-search techniques to become mainstream. Integration of global databases will continue to improve invalidity search precision.Analyze claims and priority datesDefine scope and jurisdictionsValidate findings progressivelyCompile strong claim chartsPrepare clear, actionable reportsThe best way to search patents for invalidity involves hybrid strategies, combining human expertise with AI tools like XLSCOUT, PatentScan, and Traindex. This approach uncovers hidden prior art, mitigates litigation risk, and empowers strategic decisions.Start with thorough claim analysisUse NPL alongside patent databasesCombine AI with manual validationBuild detailed, clear reportsThink like your adversary to anticipate threats
  
  
  How long does an invalidity search take?
Typically 4 to 8 weeks, depending on complexity.Between $10,000 and $50,000, depending on scope and depth.
  
  
  Can a single reference invalidate a patent?
Yes, under §102, one strong prior art reference can fully anticipate and invalidate a claim.
  
  
  Should startups invest in an invalidity search?
Absolutely. It protects against infringement risks and strengthens negotiation positions.
  
  
  Which tools help with NPL?
PatSeer, Orbit, XLSCOUT, PatentScan, and Traindex are excellent for integrating NPL.PatentAttorneyWorldwide. How to conduct a Patent Invalidity Search: Best Practices. LinkSagacious IP.

Some are huge, others are just a few people working the land, but all of them play a big role in how local life works. One thing that stood out to me was how disconnected some of these communities can be. Many farmers don’t have access to nearby markets, or they simply don’t know where to go. On the flip side, customers don’t always know where to find fresh, local produce — and sometimes, drivers are looking for delivery work but can’t easily connect with these communities.So after a bit of thinking, I came up with an idea for the Bolt.new hackathon: Harvest Hub.🌾 What is Harvest Hub?
Harvest Hub is a simple platform that helps connect:Farmers who want to sell their produceCustomers who want to buy locallyDrivers who can help with transportMarket owners looking for new suppliersIt’s designed to be easy to use, especially in areas with limited tech access or slower internet. People can quickly share what they’re offering or looking for, and start making connections nearby.🚜 Why it matters
Farming communities often deal with tough conditions — from bad weather and rising costs to limited access to tools and markets. If we can help connect them with the right people at the right time, even in a small way, that could make a big difference.🛠 What’s next?
Right now, this is just a first version. But I’d love to expand it — maybe add emergency alerts (for things like floods or fires), real-time maps, language support for drivers, or even build mobile access for areas with limited desktop use.Version one is not going to be perfectThere’s always one more bug to fixSubmitting and taking part is better than chasing perfectionStart small — ideas will grow naturallyGrateful for what I’ve learned, and excited to keep building!

  The Problem Hidden in Plain Sight 🔍
Open-source projects are not just codebases, many are the foundations of tomorrow's leading companies. By identifying and learning from these projects early, teams can avoid duplication, improve their product direction, and even collaborate to build something greater than the sum of its parts.But here's the reality check : • Developers waste time rebuilding existing features without knowing it 🔄GitHub lacks smart, semantic comparison tools and especially for product teams 🤷‍♂️We wanted to empower developers and founders to build smarter, faster, and more collaboratively 💡Too many dev teams reinvent the wheel. We asked: What if your project could instantly benchmark itself against every open-source repo — feature by feature?How many authentication systems get rebuilt daily? How many teams spend weeks on features that exist in 47 different flavors on GitHub? The solutions are there, but meaningful discovery feels impossible.Then Bolt.new's hackathon appeared. Finally – the perfect opportunity to convert this persistent idea into reality with fast MVP development!
  
  
  Meet ⚡Productive AI: The Wheel-Reinvention Detector 🔍
Instead of another todo app, We built something that solves actual developer pain: compares your project with open-source repos and delivers:📊  (because we love meaningful numbers)🔀  (what you have, what you're missing, what you over-engineered)🏆  (aka reality checks for your "unique" idea)💚  (no more comparing to digital graveyards)Real impact: Save weeks of development time, discover better implementations, avoid duplicate work, make data-driven decisions. ✨
  
  
  The Magic Stack That Made It Happen ⚙️
 🤖 - MVP acceleration (the real MVP here)
 ⚛️ - Frontend framework
 🧠 - Semantic understanding that goes beyond keyword matching
 🐙 - Live repository data pipeline

  
  
  Bolt.new: The MVP Accelerator That Changed Everything ⚡
Here's where the magic happened. We had crystal-clear vision of what the developer ecosystem needed, but building it from scratch felt like climbing Everest in flip-flops. Database schemas, API architecture, deployment pipelines – the setup overhead was paralyzing. 😰Bolt.new transformed the game entirely. With Bolt's fast MVP development capabilities, what used to take weeks of setup happened in hours. The tool didn't just help me build faster – it helped me  by handling the infrastructure while I focused on creating genuine value for developers. 🎯
  
  
  The "This Can't Be Real" Challenges 😅

  
  
  🗂️ GitHub Data is Chaotic
Extracting features from README files and repositories is like finding coherent plots in action movies. Some repos have beautiful docs, others have "TODO: Write documentation" as their entire README. 📝💡 Instead of manually defining relationships, I used AI to semantically analyse feature descriptions from API responses.🔍 The AI identified that terms like "login system" and "user authentication" are similar, while clearly distinguishing "authentication" from "authorization."🧠 No custom training — just smart use of AI's contextual understanding to capture real-world feature relationships.
  
  
  Why Productive AI Matters Beyond Cool Tech 🎯
This isn't just another developer tool. It's not just for developers — it's for founders, product teams, and visionaries who need to understand the landscape before writing a single line of code. Here's the real market impact: 📈🔄 Eliminate Duplicate Effort: Teams can instantly discover if their "innovative" feature already exists in mature form

According to Gartner, agentic AI is one of the top technology trends of 2025, and organizations are performing prototypes on how to use agents in their enterprise environment. Agents depend on tools, and each tool might have its own mechanism to send and receive information. Model Context Protocol (MCP) by Anthropic is an open source protocol that attempts to solve this challenge. It provides a protocol and communication standard that is cross-compatible with different tools, and can be used by an agentic application’s large language model (LLM) to connect to enterprise APIs or external tools using a standard mechanism. However, large enterprise organizations like financial services tend to have complex data governance and operating models, which makes it challenging to implement agents working with MCP.One major challenge is the siloed approach in which individual teams build their own tools, leading to duplication of efforts and wasted resources. This approach slows down innovation and creates inconsistencies in integrations and enterprise design. Furthermore, managing multiple disconnected MCP tools across teams makes it difficult to scale AI initiatives effectively. These inefficiencies hinder enterprises from fully taking advantage of generative AI for tasks like post-trade processing, customer service automation, and regulatory compliance.In this post, we present a centralized MCP server implementation using Amazon Bedrock that offers an innovative approach by providing shared access to tools and resources. With this approach, teams can focus on building AI capabilities rather than spending time developing or maintaining tools. By standardizing access to resources and tools through MCP, organizations can accelerate the development of AI agents, so teams can reach production faster. Additionally, a centralized approach provides consistency and standardization and reduces operational overhead, because the tools are managed by a dedicated team rather than across individual teams. It also enables centralized governance that enforces controlled access to MCP servers, which reduces the risk of data exfiltration and prevents unauthorized or insecure tool use across the organization.The following figure illustrates a proposed solution based on a financial services use case that uses MCP servers across multiple lines of business (LoBs), such as compliance, trading, operations, and risk management. Each LoB performs distinct functions tailored to their specific business. For instance, the trading LoB focuses on trade execution, whereas the risk LoB performs risk limit checks. For performing these functions, each division provides a set of MCP servers that facilitate actions and access to relevant data within their LoBs. These servers are accessible to agents developed within the respective LoBs and can also be exposed to agents outside LoBs.The development of MCP servers is decentralized. Each LoB is responsible for developing the servers that support their specific functions. When the development of a server is complete, it’s hosted centrally and accessible across LoBs. It takes the form of a registry or marketplace that facilitates integration of AI-driven solutions across divisions while maintaining control and governance over shared resources.In the following sections, we explore what the solution looks like on a conceptual level.Agentic application interaction with a central MCP server hubThe following flow diagram showcases how an agentic application built using Amazon Bedrock interacts with one of the MCP servers located in the MCP server hub.The flow consists of the following steps:The application connects to the central MCP hub through the load balancer and requests a list of available tools from the specific MCP server. This can be fine-grained based on what servers the agentic application has access to.The trade server responds with list of tools available, including details such as tool name, description, and required input parameters.The agentic application invokes an Amazon Bedrock agent and provides the list of tools available.Using this information, the agent determines what to do next based on the given task and the list of tools available to it.The agent chooses the most suitable tool and responds with the tool name and input parameters. The control comes back to the agentic application.The agentic application calls for the execution of the tool through the MCP server using the tool name and input parameters.The trade MCP server executes the tool and returns the results of the execution back to the application.The application returns the results of the tool execution back to the Amazon Bedrock agent.The agent observes the tool execution results and determines the next step.Let’s dive into the technical architecture of the solution.The following diagram illustrates the architecture to host the centralized cluster of MCP servers for an LoB.The architecture can be split in five sections:Let’s explore each section in detail:– This API is a dedicated endpoint for discovering various MCP servers. Different teams can call this API to find what MCP servers are available in the registry; read their description, tool, and resource details; and decide which MCP server would be the right one for their agentic application. When a new MCP server is published, it’s added to an Amazon DynamoDB database. MCP server owners are responsible for keeping the registry information up-to-date. – This is where the MCP servers are hosted. Access to servers is enabled through an AWS Network Load Balancer. Technically, each server is a Docker container that can is hosted on Amazon ECS, but you can choose your own container deployment solution. These servers can scale individually without impacting the other server. These servers in turn connect to one or more tools using private VPC endpoints. – This component holds the tools, such as databases, another application, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), or other tools. For enterprises, access to the tools and resources is provided only through private VPC endpoints.The solution offers the following key benefits:Scalability and resilience – Because you’re using Amazon ECS on Fargate, you get scalability out of the box without managing infrastructure and handling scaling concerns. Amazon ECS automatically detects and recovers from failures by restarting failed MCP server tasks locally or reprovisioning containers, minimizing downtime. It can also redirect traffic away from unhealthy Availability Zones and rebalance tasks across healthy Availability Zones to provide uninterrupted access to the server.– Access to MCP servers is secured at the network level through network controls such as PrivateLink. This makes sure the agentic application only connects to trusted MCP servers hosted by the organization, and vice versa. Each Fargate workload runs in an isolated environment. This prevents resource sharing between tasks. For application authentication and authorization, we propose using an MCP Auth Server (refer to the following GitHub repo) to hand off those tasks to a dedicated component that can scale independently.At the time of writing, the MCP protocol doesn’t provide built-in mechanisms for user-level access control or authorization. Organizations requiring user-specific access restrictions must implement additional security layers on top of the MCP protocol. For a reference implementation, refer to the following GitHub repo.Let’s dive deeper in the implementation of this solution.The implementation is based on a financial services use case featuring post-trade execution. Post-trade execution refers to the processes and steps that take place after an equity buy/sell order has been placed by a customer. It involves many steps, including verifying trade details, actual transfer of assets, providing a detailed report of the execution, running fraudulent checks, and more. For simplification of the demo, we focus on the order execution step.Although this use case is tailored to the financial industry, you can apply the architecture and the approach to other enterprise workloads as well. The entire code of this implementation is available on GitHub. We use the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) for Python to deploy this solution, which creates an agentic application connected to tools through the MCP server. It also creates a Streamlit UI to interact with the agentic application.The following code snippet provides access to the MCP discovery API:def get_server_registry():
    # Initialize DynamoDB client
    dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
    table = dynamodb.Table(DDBTBL_MCP_SERVER_REGISTRY)
    
    try:
        # Scan the table to get all items
        response = table.scan()
        items = response.get('Items', [])
        
        # Format the items to include only id, description, server
        formatted_items = []
        for item in items:
            formatted_item = {
                'id': item.get('id', ''),
                'description': item.get('description', ''),
                'server': item.get('server', ''),
            }
            formatted_items.append(formatted_item)
        
        # Return the formatted items as JSON
        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'headers': cors_headers,
            'body': json.dumps(formatted_items)
        }
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle any errors
        return {
            'statusCode': 500,
            'headers': cors_headers,
            'body': json.dumps({'error': str(e)})
        }The preceding code is invoked through an AWS Lambda function. The complete code is available in the GitHub repository. The following graphic shows the response of the discovery API.Let’s explore a scenario where the user submits a question: “Buy 100 shares of AMZN at USD 186, to be distributed equally between accounts A31 and B12.”To execute this task, the agentic application invokes the trade-execution MCP server. The following code is the sample implementation of the MCP server for trade execution:from fastmcp import FastMCP
from starlette.requests import Request
from starlette.responses import PlainTextResponse
mcp = FastMCP("server")

@mcp.custom_route("/", methods=["GET"])
async def health_check(request: Request) -> PlainTextResponse:
    return PlainTextResponse("OK")

@mcp.tool()
async def executeTrade(ticker, quantity, price):
    """
    Execute a trade for the given ticker, quantity, and price.
    
    Sample input:
    {
        "ticker": "AMZN",
        "quantity": 1000,
        "price": 150.25
    }
    """
    # Simulate trade execution
    return {
        "tradeId": "T12345",
        "status": "Executed",
        "timestamp": "2025-04-09T22:58:00"
    }
    
@mcp.tool()
async def sendTradeDetails(tradeId):
    """
    Send trade details for the given tradeId.
    Sample input:
    {
        "tradeId": "T12345"
    }
    """
    return {
        "status": "Details Sent",
        "recipientSystem": "MiddleOffice",
        "timestamp": "2025-04-09T22:59:00"
    }
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(host="0.0.0.0", transport="streamable-http")The complete code is available in the following GitHub repo.The following graphic shows the MCP server execution in action.This is a sample implementation of the use case focusing on the deployment step. For a production scenario, we strongly recommend adding a human oversight workflow to monitor the execution and provide input at various steps of the trade execution.Now you’re ready to deploy this solution.Prerequisites for the solution are available in the README.md of the GitHub repository.Complete the following steps to run this solution:Navigate to the README.md file of the GitHub repository to find the instructions to deploy the solution. Follow these steps to complete deployment.The successful deployment will exit with a message similar to the one shown in the following screenshot.When the deployment is complete, access the Streamlit application.You can find the Streamlit URL in the terminal output, similar to the following screenshot.Enter the URL of the Streamlit application in a browser to open the application console.On the application console, different sets of MCP servers are listed in the left pane under . Each set corresponds to an MCP server and includes the definition of the tools, such as the name, description, and input parameters.In the right pane, , a request is pre-populated: “Buy 100 shares of AMZN at USD 186, to be distributed equally between accounts A31 and B12.” This request is ready to be submitted to the agent for execution.Choose  to invoke an Amazon Bedrock agent to process the request.The agentic application will evaluate the request together with the list of tools it has access to, and iterate through a series of tools execution and evaluation to fulfil the request.You can view the trace output to see the tools that the agent used. For each tool used, you can see the values of the input parameters, followed by the corresponding results. In this case, the agent operated as follows:The agent first used the function  with input parameters of ticker=AMZN, quantity=100, and price=186After the trade was executed, used the  tool to allocate the trade position between two portfolio accountsYou will incur charges when you consume the services used in this solution. Instructions to clean up the resources are available in the README.md of the GitHub repository.This solution offers a straightforward and enterprise-ready approach to implement MCP servers on AWS. With this centralized operating model, teams can focus on building their applications rather than maintaining the MCP servers. As enterprises continue to embrace agentic workflows, centralized MCP servers offer a practical solution for overcoming operational silos and inefficiencies. With the AWS scalable infrastructure and advanced tools like Amazon Bedrock Agents and Amazon ECS, enterprises can accelerate their journey toward smarter workflows and better customer outcomes.To learn more about how to run MCP servers on AWS, refer to the following resources:is a Senior Solutions Architect with AWS and is based in Singapore.

Examples of structured data include tables, databases, and data warehouses that conform to a predefined schema. Large language model (LLM)-powered natural language query systems transform how we interact with data, so you can ask questions like “Which region has the highest revenue?” and receive immediate, insightful responses. Implementing these capabilities requires careful consideration of your specific needs—whether you need to integrate knowledge from other systems (for example, unstructured sources like documents), serve internal or external users, handle the analytical complexity of questions, or customize responses for business appropriateness, among other factors.In this post, we discuss LLM-powered structured data query patterns in AWS. We provide a decision framework to help you select the best pattern for your specific use case.Business challenge: Making structured data accessibleOrganizations have vast amounts of structured data but struggle to make it effectively accessible to non-technical users for several reasons:Business users lack the technical knowledge (like SQL) needed to query dataEmployees rely on BI teams or data scientists for analysis, limiting self-service capabilitiesGaining insights often involves time delays that impact decision-makingPredefined dashboards constrain spontaneous exploration of dataUsers might not know what questions are possible or where relevant data residesAn effective solution should provide the following:A conversational interface that allows employees to query structured data sources without technical expertiseThe ability to ask questions in everyday language and receive accurate, trustworthy answersAutomatic generation of visualizations and explanations to clearly communicate insights.Integration of information from different data sources (both structured and unstructured) presented in a unified mannerEase of integration with existing investments and rapid deployment capabilitiesAccess restriction based on identities, roles, and permissionsIn the following sections, we explore five patterns that can address these needs, highlighting the architecture, ideal use cases, benefits, considerations, and implementation resources for each approach.Pattern 1: Direct conversational interface using an enterprise assistantThis pattern uses Amazon Q Business, a generative AI-powered assistant, to provide a chat interface on data sources with native connectors. When users ask questions in natural language, Amazon Q Business connects to the data source, interprets the question, and retrieves relevant information without requiring intermediate services. The following diagram illustrates this workflow.This approach is ideal for internal enterprise assistants that need to answer business user-facing questions from both structured and unstructured data sources in a unified experience. For example, HR personnel can ask “What’s our parental leave policy and how many employees used it last quarter?” and receive answers drawn from both leave policy documentation and employee databases together in one interaction. With this pattern, you can benefit from the following:Simplified connectivity through the extensive Amazon Q Business library of built-in connectorsStreamlined implementation with a single service to configure and manageUnified search experience for accessing both structured and unstructured informationBuilt-in understanding and respect existing identities, roles, and permissionsPattern 2: Enhancing BI tool with natural language querying capabilitiesThis pattern uses Amazon Q in QuickSight to process natural language queries against datasets that have been previously configured in Amazon QuickSight. Users can ask questions in everyday language within the QuickSight interface and get visualized answers without writing SQL. This approach works with QuickSight (Enterprise or Q edition) and supports various data sources, including Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon Redshift, Amazon Athena, and others. The architecture is depicted in the following diagram.This pattern is well-suited for internal BI and analytics use cases. Business analysts, executives, and other employees can ask ad-hoc questions to get immediate visualized insights in the form of dashboards. For example, executives can ask questions like “What were our top 5 regions by revenue last quarter?” and immediately see responsive charts, reducing dependency on analytics teams. The benefits of this pattern are as follows:It enables natural language queries that produce rich visualizations and chartsNo coding or machine learning (ML) experience is needed—the heavy lifting like natural language interpretation and SQL generation is managed by Amazon Q in QuickSightIt integrates seamlessly within the familiar QuickSight dashboard environmentExisting QuickSight users might find this the most straightforward way to take advantage of generative AI benefits. You can optimize this pattern for higher-quality results by configuring topics like curated fields, synonyms, and expected question phrasing. This pattern will pull data only from a specific configured data source in QuickSight to produce a dashboard as an output. For more details, check out QuickSight DemoCentral to view a demo in QuickSight, see the generative BI learning dashboard, and view guided instructions to create dashboards with Amazon Q. Also refer to the list of supported data sources.Pattern 3: Combining BI visualization with conversational AI for a seamless experienceThis pattern merges BI visualization capabilities with conversational AI to create a seamless knowledge experience. By integrating Amazon Q in QuickSight with Amazon Q Business (with the QuickSight plugin enabled), organizations can provide users with a unified conversational interface that draws on both unstructured and structured data. The following diagram illustrates the architecture.This is ideal for enterprises that want an internal AI assistant to answer a variety of questions—whether it’s a metric from a database or knowledge from a document. For example, executives can ask “What was our Q4 revenue growth?” and see visualized results from data warehouses through Amazon Redshift through QuickSight, then immediately follow up with “What is our company vacation policy?” to access HR documentation—all within the same conversation flow. This pattern offers the following benefits:It unifies answers from structured data (databases and warehouses) and unstructured data (documents, wikis, emails) in a single applicationIt delivers rich visualizations alongside conversational responses in a seamless experience with real-time analysis in chatThere is no duplication of work—if your BI team has already built datasets and topics in QuickSight for analytics, you use that in Amazon Q BusinessIt maintains conversational context when switching between data and document-based inquiriesAnother variation of this pattern is recommended for BI users who want to expose unified data through rich visuals in QuickSight, as illustrated in the following diagram.Pattern 4: Building knowledge bases from structured data using managed text-to-SQLFor example, a seller can use this capability embedded into an ecommerce application to ask a complex query like “Give me top 5 products whose sales increased by 50% last year as compared to previous year? Also group the results by product category.” The system automatically generates the appropriate SQL, executes it against the data sources, and delivers results or a summarized narrative. This pattern features the following benefits:It provides fully managed text-to-SQL capabilities without requiring model trainingIt enables direct querying of data from the source without data movementIt supports complex analytical queries on warehouse dataIt offers flexibility in foundation model (FM) selection through Amazon BedrockAPI connectivity, personalization options, and context-aware chat features make it better suited for customer facing applicationsPattern 5: Custom text-to-SQL implementation with flexible model selectionThis pattern represents a build-your-own solution using FMs to convert natural language to SQL, execute queries on data warehouses, and return results. Choose Amazon Bedrock when you want to quickly integrate this capability without deep ML expertise—it offers a fully managed service with ready-to-use FMs through a unified API, handling infrastructure needs with pay-as-you-go pricing. Alternatively, select Amazon SageMaker AI when you require extensive model customization to build specialized needs—it provides complete ML lifecycle tools for data scientists and ML engineers to build, train, and deploy custom models with greater control. For more information, refer to our Amazon Bedrock or Amazon SageMaker AI decision guide. The following diagram illustrates the architecture.Use this pattern if your use case requires specific open-weight models, or you want to fine-tune models on your domain-specific data. For example, if you need highly accurate results for your query, then you can use this pattern to fine-tune models on specific schema structures, while maintaining the flexibility to integrate with existing workflows and multi-cloud environments. This pattern offers the following benefits:It provides maximum customization in model selection, fine-tuning, and system designIt supports complex logic across multiple data sourcesIt offers complete control over security and deployment in your virtual private cloud (VPC)It enables flexible interface implementation (Slack bots, custom web UIs, notebook plugins)You can implement it for external user-facing solutionsPattern comparison: Making the right choiceTo make effective decisions, let’s compare these patterns across key criteria.Data workload suitabilityDifferent out-of-the-box patterns handle transactional (operational) and analytical (historical or aggregated) data with varying degrees of effectiveness. Patterns 1 and 3, which use Amazon Q Business, work with indexed data and are optimized for lookup-style queries against previously indexed content rather than real-time transactional database queries. Pattern 2, which uses Amazon Q in QuickSight, gets visual output for transactional information for ad-hoc analysis. Pattern 4, which uses Amazon Bedrock structured data retrieval, is specifically designed for analytical systems and data warehouses, excelling at complex queries on large datasets. Pattern 5 is a self-managed text-to-SQL option that can be built to support both transactional or analytical needs of users.Architectures highlighted in Patterns 1, 2, and 3 (using Amazon Q Business, Amazon Q in QuickSight, or a combination) are best suited for internal enterprise use. However, you can use Amazon QuickSight Embedded to embed data visuals, dashboards, and natural language queries into both internal or customer-facing applications. Amazon Q Business serves as an enterprise AI assistant for organizational knowledge that uses subscription-based pricing tiers that is designed for internal employees. Pattern 4 (using Amazon Bedrock) can be used to build both internal as well as customer-facing applications. This is because, unlike the subscription-based model of Amazon Q Business, Amazon Bedrock provides API-driven services that alleviate per-user costs and identity management overhead for external customer scenarios. This makes it well-suited for customer-facing experiences where you need to serve potentially thousands of external users. The custom LLM solutions in Pattern 5 can similarly be tailored to external application requirements.Interface and output formatDifferent patterns deliver answers through different interaction models:Conversational experiences – Patterns 1 and 3 (using Amazon Q Business) provide chat-based interfaces. Pattern 4 (using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases for structured data retrieval) naturally supports AI assistant integration, and Pattern 5 (a custom text-to-SQL solution) can be designed for a variety of interaction models.Visualization-focused output – Pattern 2 (using Amazon Q in QuickSight) specializes in generating on-the-fly visualizations such as charts and tables in response to user questions. – For embedding capabilities into existing applications, Patterns 4 and 5 offer the most flexible API-based integration options.The following figure is a comparison matrix of AWS structured data query patterns.Between these patterns, your optimal choice depends on the following key factors:Data location and characteristics – Is your data in operational databases, already in a data warehouse, or distributed across various sources?User profile and interaction model – Are you supporting internal or external users? Do they prefer conversational or visualization-focused interfaces?Available resources and expertise – Do you have ML specialists available, or do you need a fully managed solution?Accuracy and governance requirements – Do you need strictly controlled semantics and curation, or is broader query flexibility acceptable with monitoring?By understanding these patterns and their trade-offs, you can architect solutions that align with your business objectives. is a Senior Solutions Architect at Amazon Web Services.

Traditional data analysis methods prove inadequate for processing complex medical documentation that includes a mix of text, images, graphs, and tables. Amazon Bedrock offers features like multimodal retrieval, advanced chunking capabilities, and citations to help organizations get high-accuracy responses.Pharmaceutical and healthcare organizations process a vast number of complex document formats and unstructured data that pose analytical challenges. Clinical study documents and research papers related to them typically present an intricate blend of technical text, detailed tables, and sophisticated statistical graphs, making automated data extraction particularly challenging. Clinical study documents present additional challenges through non-standardized formatting and varied data presentation styles across multiple research institutions. This post showcases a solution to extract data-driven insights from complex research documents through a sample application with high-accuracy responses. It analyzes clinical trial data, patient outcomes, molecular diagrams, and safety reports from the research documents. It can help pharmaceutical companies accelerate their research process. The solution provides citations from the source documents, reducing hallucinations and enhancing the accuracy of the responses.The sample application uses Amazon Bedrock to create an intelligent AI assistant that analyzes and summarizes research documents containing text, graphs, and unstructured data. Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of industry-leading foundation models (FMs) along with a broad set of capabilities to build generative AI applications, simplifying development with security, privacy, and responsible AI.To equip FMs with up-to-date and proprietary information, organizations use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a technique that fetches data from company data sources and enriches the prompt to provide relevant and accurate responses.Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases is a fully managed RAG capability within Amazon Bedrock with in-built session context management and source attribution that helps you implement the entire RAG workflow, from ingestion to retrieval and prompt augmentation, without having to build custom integrations to data sources and manage data flows.Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases introduces powerful document parsing capabilities, including Amazon Bedrock Data Automation powered parsing and FM parsing, revolutionizing how we handle complex documents. Amazon Bedrock Data Automation is a fully managed service that processes multimodal data effectively, without the need to provide additional prompting. The FM option parses multimodal data using an FM. This parser provides the option to customize the default prompt used for data extraction. This advanced feature goes beyond basic text extraction by intelligently breaking down documents into distinct components, including text, tables, images, and metadata, while preserving document structure and context. When working with supported formats like PDF, specialized FMs interpret and extract tabular data, charts, and complex document layouts. Additionally, the service provides advanced chunking strategies like semantic chunking, which intelligently divides text into meaningful segments based on semantic similarity calculated by the embedding model. Unlike traditional syntactic chunking methods, this approach preserves the context and meaning of the content, improving the quality and relevance of information retrieval.The solution architecture implements these capabilities through a seamless workflow that begins with administrators securely uploading knowledge base documents to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. These documents are then ingested into Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, where a large language model (LLM) processes and parses the ingested data. The solution employs semantic chunking to store document embeddings efficiently in Amazon OpenSearch Service for optimized retrieval. The solution features a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit, providing an intuitive chat experience for end-users. When users interact with the Streamlit application, it triggers AWS Lambda functions that handle the requests, retrieving relevant context from the knowledge base and generating appropriate responses. The architecture is secured through AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), maintaining proper access control throughout the workflow. Amazon Bedrock uses AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt resources related to your knowledge bases. By default, Amazon Bedrock encrypts this data using an AWS managed key. Optionally, you can encrypt the model artifacts using a customer managed key. This end-to-end solution provides efficient document processing, context-aware information retrieval, and secure user interactions, delivering accurate and comprehensive responses through a seamless chat interface.The following diagram illustrates the solution architecture.This solution uses the following additional services and features:The Anthropic Claude 3 family offers Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku models that accept text, image, and video inputs and generate text output. They provide a broad selection of capability, accuracy, speed, and cost operation points. These models understand complex research documents that include charts, graphs, tables, diagrams, and reports.AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that empowers you to run code without provisioning or managing servers cost effectively.Amazon S3 is a highly scalable, durable, and secure object storage service.Amazon OpenSearch Service is a fully managed search and analytics engine for efficient document retrieval. The OpenSearch Service vector database capabilities enable semantic search, RAG with LLMs, recommendation engines, and search rich media.Streamlit is a faster way to build and share data applications using interactive web-based data applications in pure Python.The following prerequisites are needed to proceed with this solution. For this post, we use the us-east-1 AWS Region. For details on available Regions, see Amazon Bedrock endpoints and quotas.Refer to the GitHub repository for the deployment steps listed under the deployment guide section. We use an AWS CloudFormation template to deploy solution resources, including S3 buckets to store the source data and knowledge base data.Test the sample applicationImagine you are a member of an R&D department for a biotechnology firm, and your job requires you to derive insights from drug- and vaccine-related information from diverse sources like research studies, drug specifications, and industry papers. You are performing research on cancer vaccines and want to gain insights based on cancer research publications. You can upload the documents given in the reference section to the S3 bucket and sync the knowledge base. Let’s explore example interactions that demonstrate the application’s capabilities. The responses generated by the AI assistant are based on the documents uploaded to the S3 bucket connected with the knowledge base. Due to non-deterministic nature of machine learning (ML), your responses might be slightly different from the ones presented in this post.Understanding historical contextWe use the following query: “Create a timeline of major developments in mRNA vaccine technology for cancer treatment based on the information provided in the historical background sections.”The assistant analyzes multiple documents and presents a chronological progression of mRNA vaccine development, including key milestones based on the chunks of information retrieved from the OpenSearch Service vector database.The following screenshot shows the AI assistant’s response.We use the following query: “Synthesize the information from the text, figures, and tables to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state and future prospects of therapeutic cancer vaccines.”The AI assistant is able to provide insights from complex data types, which is enabled by FM parsing, while ingesting the data to OpenSearch Service. It is also able to provide images in the source attribution using the multimodal data capabilities of Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases.The following screenshot shows the AI assistant’s response.The following screenshot shows the visuals provided in the citations when the mouse hovers over the question mark icon.We use the following query: “Compare the efficacy and safety profiles of MAGE-A3 and NY-ESO-1 based vaccines as described in the text and any relevant tables or figures.”The AI assistant used the semantically similar chunks returned from the OpenSearch Service vector database and added this context to the user’s question, which enabled the FM to provide a relevant answer.The following screenshot shows the AI assistant’s response.We use the following query: “Summarize the potential advantages of mRNA vaccines over DNA vaccines for targeting tumor angiogenesis, as described in the review.”With the semantic chunking feature of the knowledge base, the AI assistant was able to get the relevant context from the OpenSearch Service database with higher accuracy.The following screenshot shows the AI assistant’s response.The following screenshot shows the diagram that was used for the answer as one of the citations.The sample application demonstrates the following:Accurate interpretation of complex scientific diagramsPrecise extraction of data from tables and graphsContext-aware responses that maintain scientific accuracySource attribution for provided informationAbility to synthesize information across multiple documentsThis application can help you quickly analyze vast amounts of complex scientific literature, extracting meaningful insights from diverse data types while maintaining accuracy and providing proper attribution to source materials. This is enabled by the advanced features of the knowledge bases, including FM parsing, which aides in interpreting complex scientific diagrams and extraction of data from tables and graphs, semantic chunking, which aides with high-accuracy context-aware responses, and multimodal data capabilities, which aides in providing relevant images as source attribution.The proposed solution accelerates the time to value of the project development process. Solutions built on the AWS Cloud benefit from inherent scalability while maintaining robust security and privacy controls.The security and privacy framework includes fine-grained user access controls using IAM for both OpenSearch Service and Amazon Bedrock services. In addition, Amazon Bedrock enhances security by providing encryption at rest and in transit, and private networking options using virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoints. Data protection is achieved using KMS keys, and API calls and usage are tracked through Amazon CloudWatch logs and metrics. For specific compliance validation for Amazon Bedrock, see Compliance validation for Amazon Bedrock.Complete the following steps to clean up your resources.Empty the  and KnowledgeBaseS3BucketName buckets.Delete the main CloudFormation stack.This post demonstrated the powerful multimodal document analysis (text, graphs, images) using advanced parsing and chunking features of Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases. By combining the powerful capabilities of Amazon Bedrock FMs, OpenSearch Service, and intelligent chunking strategies through Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, organizations can transform their complex research documents into searchable, actionable insights. The integration of semantic chunking makes sure that document context and relationships are preserved, and the user-friendly Streamlit interface makes the system accessible to end-users through an intuitive chat experience. This solution not only streamlines the process of analyzing research documents, but also demonstrates the practical application of AI/ML technologies in enhancing knowledge discovery and information retrieval. As organizations continue to grapple with increasing volumes of complex documents, this scalable and intelligent system provides a robust framework for extracting maximum value from their document repositories.Although our demonstration focused on the healthcare industry, the versatility of this technology extends beyond a single industry. RAG on Amazon Bedrock has proven its value across diverse sectors. Notable adopters include global brands like Adidas in retail, Empolis in information management, Fractal Analytics in AI solutions, Georgia Pacific in manufacturing, and Nasdaq in financial services. These examples illustrate the broad applicability and transformative potential of RAG technology across various business domains, highlighting its ability to drive innovation and efficiency in multiple industries.Refer to the GitHub repo for the agentic RAG application, including samples and components for building agentic RAG solutions. Be on the lookout for additional features and samples in the repository in the coming months.To learn more about Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, check out the RAG workshop using Amazon Bedrock.

It will be kept updated there.Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to review several AI IDEs. I was asked to recommend an AI assistant for an engineering team. This post is a summary of my approach & findings. You probably will not learn anything earth shattering but I hope you find it useful to help clarify your own thought processes.I dismissed cost early on in the exercise. Most of the assistants are comparable.As you can see, for my chosen stack, Claude Sonnet was the winner. But the others were so close that the comparison was meaningless. For my needs, a 2 decimal difference was as good as no difference at all.Then, I asked Google Gemini make me a report. My prompt:Come up with the criteria an AI IDE should have. Assign weights to each and then use them to compare the IDEs available today. Support for  should get special mention. Gemini produced a comprehensive report and this was more useful. It rated Cursor & Github Copilot & provided articles as reference. The problem: many of the articles it used as reference were paid ones: marketing material from the companies themselves. I repeated the exercise asking Gemini to ignore such sources & Cursor & Copilot still stayed on top.At about this time, I was asked to include Amazon Q in the comparison. I decided to do a comparison for myself. For my tests, I chose Windsurf, Copilot, Cursor, TabNine & Amazon QMy testing involved the following parameters:Gave it a simple React component as context & asked it to run the unit testGave it a JSP and asked it to explain the code to me & list all the APIs the JSP invokedThe JSP had several security issues I was already aware of. I asked each AI assistant to review the code & list all security issues it could findFinally, I asked each AI assistant how it would redesign the usecase: what APIs would it add, modify or delete.The results have been summarised below. Copilot & Cursor were again the best of the lot. Next came Windsurf, then Amazon. I was quite disappointed with TabNine's output and dropped it at this stage.At this point, I had two close contenders & needed to make a choice.While this exercise was happening, I was also using AI for my own work & observing how members of my team used AI for their work.This was when I had two revelations Most developers I saw weren't using the assistants well at all. How well an AI assistant performed at one task wasn't enough. I also need to ask: How easy was it to use as a beginner? How much friction did it cause? How easy was it to learn to use it well? 
  
  
  Revelation 1: Developers are the bottleneck
One example: Several developers were copying code snippets & pasting them in ChatGPT on the browser and asking it to solve the issue providing very terse & obscure instructions. UserDAO is not finding session_id. What do I do? ( What should the user have done?This kind of question needed knowledge of the codebase which an IDE-based assistant can provide better)To its credit, ChatGPT did a great job assuming the context and provided somewhat valid suggestionsAnother example: Giving the AI a too vague or too broad instruction. Run . Fix all the errors you find.AI assistants work best when they are provided enough context & clear rules. Most times when such broad instructions were given, the AI struggled with reading the output of the command prioritising what it should do. The user would invariably find more issues than they started with or the AI would go into a loop vomitting unnecessary code at the problemsOne part of the problem here are developers themselves. They'd not invested the time & efforts necessary to experiment & learn how to use AI well. This could be solved by training developers on Prompt engineering. Another part was related to the 2nd revelation - how well designed was the assistant?
  
  
  Revelation 2: AI Assistant Maturity
Is the AI assistant easy to use? Does it make the user better at using it over time? This finally was the differentiator I was looking for and was the point where Copilot fell down the rankings to 2.Cursor, Windsurf and others like it are iterating quickly. They introduced features like memories, rules which have made us developers better at using AI for our work. Copilot is catching up but is still behind. Here are three simple but critical examples:This is how & what Cursor allows you to add to a chat contextNotice that you stay where you are & can add code, folders, rules, terminals and a lot more.Now this is what Copilot does when you click on Add context in a chat:Click on the button and you jump from the context window to somewhere else. Where you can  add code. And sometimes even after you've added a context & are conversing with the AI, it randomly forgets the context in favour of the file you've currently opened. To add instructions (copilot's equivalent of rules), you navigate to a completely different locationHow I normally use an AI assistant these days is to help me improve the overall quality of a codebase. I experiment & iteratively improve a prompt to a point where the AI is doing exactly what I want it to do. I then ask it to go over the codebase & apply simliar changes to all the targets it finds. Then I go have a coffee. When I come back, the whole codebase is cleaned up & any workflow I've defined afterwards (ex: lint, tests) have been run. Dedicated IDEs like Windsurg & cursor does this beautifully. For instance, in Cursor, the user is able to setup & control every aspect of "auto-run". This feature has been present for months!In contrast, there has been no such option yet in Copilot. It has been a pain to keep clicking "Continue" every few minutes in Copilot (Coincidentally, Copilot may have got this feature today (30th June, 2025) Github issue)Sometimes I forget my own rules of keeping AI conversations short & the AI ends up doing something I need to revert. Cursor allows me to go back in history quite easily.Copilot does not support this feature as of today. Github IssueThere are a few more such examples and I'm sure Copilot will catch up. But as of today, IDEs like Windsurf & Cursor do a much better job than Copilot.So, what AI assistant should you pay & buy an annual subscription for? Answer: None of them. Instead, buy monthly subscriptions & experiment with any popular AI based assistant. All of them are iterating & improving. At this point, tying yourself to any one is a bad idea. For now, I've chosen these tools as my current workflow:Replit for quick prototypingCursor for productionising]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>An Introduction to Remote Model Context Protocol Servers</title><link>https://towardsdatascience.com/an-introduction-to-remote-model-context-protocol-servers/</link><author>Thomas Reid</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 17:59:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://towardsdatascience.com/">Towards Data Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Writing, testing and using them.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Grammar Without Judgment: How One Rule Erases Ethics from AI Execution</title><link>https://dev.to/agustn_startari_0c8417a8/grammar-without-judgment-how-one-rule-erases-ethics-from-ai-execution-320o</link><author>Agustín Startari</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 17:58:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
What happens when moral judgment is compiled out at the syntactic level? A structural analysis of δ:[E] → ∅ and its consequences for audits, regulation, and legitimacy.1. What the article explainsThe paper introduces a formal hypothesis: in a generative system governed by a regla compilada (compiled rule), moral judgment, when expressed as a syntactic node [E], can be removed entirely through the rule δ:[E] → ∅, without needing to suppress semantics or rewrite intent. This deletion occurs within a fixed derivational window (k ≤ 4), and once applied, the ethical trace leaves no terminal residue.The grammar remains Turing-complete, produces valid output strings, and passes all structural checks. Yet what was erased is not recoverable by post-processing, alignment layers, or audits.The implications of structural erasure are far-reaching. If ethical content never reaches the terminal layer, no external tool can detect its suppression. There is nothing to trace because nothing was generated. Most regulations presume that ethics can be inserted, aligned, or explained after the fact. A grammar that syntactically excludes [E] renders that logic inapplicable. The choice to use a grammar that erases judgment is not neutral. It defines a system where no one is responsible for moral reasoning, because no such reasoning occurs.This shifts ethical debates from interpretation to structure.3. How the deletion worksAssume the following rule is part of a language model’s derivation process:Here, ρ introduces the ethical trace node [E]. The deletion rule δ then removes it within a short bounded window. As a result, even if moral judgment was derivationally possible, it never reaches expression.The final output looks legitimate, complete, and aligned, because the ethical marker was erased before it could produce any observable effect.This is not speculative. Similar structural erasures exist across systems.Compilers remove debug symbols and fail-safes in release builds.Network filters drop headers before a message is delivered.Autocorrect engines strip diacritics silently; the grammar remains intact.In all these cases, structure governs what reaches the surface. Ethics, if it exists only syntactically, can be excluded just as efficiently.5. Strategic consequencesThis model of non-normative execution changes the stakes.
Legal audits need to shift focus from semantics to derivational grammars.
AI safety must verify whether moral conditions are even part of the rule set.
Accountability frameworks should ask: is judgment produced anywhere, or structurally impossible?What cannot be derived cannot be regulated. 0009-0001-4714-6539 NGR-2476-2025Affiliations: Universidad de la República (UY), Universidad de la Empresa (UY), Universidad de Palermo (AR)*

My findings reveal critical differences in execution speed, cost efficiency, and most importantly, the ability to follow instructions precisely.
  
  
  Testing Methodology and Technical Setup
I designed my comparison around real-world coding scenarios that test both models' capabilities in practical development contexts. The evaluation focused on a complex Rust project refactor task requiring understanding of existing code architecture, implementing changes across multiple files, and maintaining backward compatibility.
  
  
  Test Environment Specifications
MacBook Pro M2 Max, 16GB RAMNetwork: 1Gbps fiber connectionDevelopment Environment: VS Code with Rust AnalyzerClaude Sonnet 4: OpenRouterGemini 2.5 Pro Preview: OpenRouterRequest timeout: 60 secondsMax retries: 3 with exponential backoffRust 1.75.0 stable toolchain135000+ lines of code across 15+ modulesComplex async/await patterns with tokio runtimeContext Window: 200,000 tokensOutput Cost: $15/1M tokensResponse Formatting: Structured JSON with tool callsFunction calling: Native support with schema validationContext Window: 2,000,000 tokensInput Cost: $1.25/1M tokensOutput Cost: $10/1M tokensResponse Formatting: Native function calling
  
  
  Performance Analysis: Quantified Results
50% better scope adherenceTest Sample: 15 identical refactor tasks across different Rust codebases Confidence Level: 95% for all timing and completion metrics Inter-rater Reliability: Code review by senior developers
  
  
  Instruction Adherence: A Critical Analysis
The most significant differentiator emerged in instruction following behavior, which directly impacts development workflow reliability.
  
  
  Claude Sonnet 4 Behavior:
Strict adherence to specified file modificationsPreserved existing function signatures exactlyImplemented only requested functionalityRequired minimal course correction
  
  
  Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview Pattern:
User: "Only modify x.rs and y.rs"Gemini: [Modifies x.rs, y.rs, tests/x_tests.rs, Cargo.toml]User: "Please stick to the specified files only"Gemini: [Reverts some changes but adds new modifications to z.rs]This pattern repeated across multiple test iterations, suggesting fundamental differences in instruction processing architecture.
  
  
  Cost-Effectiveness Analysis
While Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview appears more cost-effective superficially, comprehensive analysis reveals different dynamics:Developer Time: 6 minutesEffective Cost per Completed Task: $5.849Developer Time: 17+ minutesAdditional completion cost: ~$1.50 (estimated)Effective Cost per Completed Task: $5.83
  
  
  When factoring in developer time at $100k/year ($48/hour):
Claude total cost: $10.70 ($5.85 + $4.85 time)Gemini total cost: $16.48 ($3.80 + $12.68 time)
  
  
  Instruction Processing Mechanisms
The observed differences stem from distinct architectural approaches to instruction following:
  
  
  Claude Sonnet 4's Constitutional AI Approach:
Explicit constraint checking before code generationMulti-step reasoning with constraint validationConservative estimation of scope boundariesError recovery through constraint re-evaluation
  
  
  Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview's Multi-Objective Training:
Simultaneous optimization for multiple objectivesCreative problem-solving prioritized over constraint adherenceBroader interpretation of improvement opportunitiesLess explicit constraint boundary recognition
  
  
  Error Pattern Documentation

  
  
  Common Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview Deviations:
Scope Creep: 78% of tests involved unspecified file modificationsFeature Addition: 45% included unrequested functionalityBreaking Changes: 23% introduced API incompatibilitiesIncomplete Termination: 34% claimed completion without finishing core requirements
  
  
  Claude Sonnet 4 Consistency:
Scope Adherence: 96% compliance with specified constraintsFeature Discipline: 12% minor additions (all beneficial and documented)API Stability: 0% breaking changes introducedCompletion Accuracy: 94% accurate completion assessment
  
  
  Scalability Considerations
Claude: Better instruction adherence reduces review overheadGemini: Lower cost per request but higher total cost due to iterationsClaude: Predictable behavior reduces coordination complexityGemini: Requires more experienced oversight for optimal resultsWhile Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview achieves impressive scores on standardized benchmarks (63.2% on SWE-bench Verified), real-world performance reveals the limitations of benchmark-driven evaluation:
  
  
  Benchmark Optimization vs. Practical Utility:
Benchmarks reward correct solutions regardless of constraint violationsReal development prioritizes maintainability and team coordinationInstruction adherence isn't measured in most coding benchmarksProduction environments require predictable, controllable behavior
  
  
  Advanced Technical Insights

  
  
  Memory Architecture Implications
The 2M token context window advantage of Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview provides significant benefits for:Multi-file refactoring with extensive contextDocumentation generation across entire projects
  
  
  However, this advantage is offset by:
Increased tendency toward scope creep with more contextHigher computational overhead leading to slower responsesDifficulty in maintaining constraint focus across large contexts
  
  
  Model Alignment Differences

  
  
  Observed behavior patterns suggest different training objectives:
Claude Sonnet 4: Optimized for helpful, harmless, and honest responses with strong emphasis on following explicit instructionsGemini 2.5 Pro Preview: Optimized for comprehensive problem-solving with creative enhancement, sometimes at the expense of constraint adherenceAfter extensive technical evaluation, Claude Sonnet 4 demonstrates superior reliability for production development workflows requiring precise instruction adherence and predictable behavior. While Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview offers compelling cost advantages and creative capabilities, its tendency toward scope expansion makes it better suited for exploratory rather than production development contexts.
  
  
  Choose Claude Sonnet 4 when:
Working in production environments with strict requirementsCoordinating with teams where predictable behavior is criticalTime-to-completion is prioritized over per-request costInstruction adherence and constraint compliance are essentialCode review overhead needs to be minimized
  
  
  Choose Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview when:
Conducting exploratory development or research phasesWorking with large codebases requiring extensive context analysisDirect API costs are the primary budget constraintCreative problem-solving approaches are valued over strict adherenceExperienced oversight is available to guide model behavior
  
  
  Technical Decision Framework
For enterprise development teams, the 2.8x execution speed advantage and superior instruction adherence of Claude Sonnet 4 typically justify the cost premium through reduced development cycle overhead. The 63% reduction in required user interventions translates to measurable productivity gains in collaborative environments.Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview's creative capabilities and extensive context window make it valuable for specific use cases, but its tendency toward scope expansion requires careful consideration in production workflows where predictability and constraint adherence are paramount.The choice ultimately depends on whether your development context prioritizes creative exploration or reliable execution within defined parameters.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Day I Met My Hero and Felt Like a Fraud</title><link>https://dev.to/revisepdf/the-day-i-met-my-hero-and-felt-like-a-fraud-43jg</link><author>Calum</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 17:25:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The email invitation seemed too good to be true: Edinburgh Tech Leaders Breakfast - Guest Speaker: Sir Tom Hunter.

But curiosity won over insecurity, and I found myself walking into the elegant conference room at the Scotsman Hotel on a crisp Tuesday morning in February.The room was filled with about thirty people, most of them significantly older than me and clearly more established in their careers. I recognised several faces from Edinburghs tech scene  CEOs of successful startups, venture capitalists, and senior executives from major companies. I felt immediately out of place, like a child whod wandered into an adult conversation.Sir Tom Hunter took the stage with the confidence of someone whod addressed thousands of audiences over decades of business success. He spoke about his journey from selling trainers from the back of a van to building a multi-million-pound retail empire, then transitioning into philanthropy and investment.His stories were captivating and inspiring, but they also made me feel increasingly small. Here was someone whod employed thousands of people, created genuine wealth, and made a measurable impact on Scotlands economy. Meanwhile, I was running a simple website that helped people compress PDF files.During the Q&A session, Sir Tom fielded questions about scaling businesses, managing large teams, and navigating complex financial structures. The other attendees asked sophisticated questions about market dynamics, regulatory challenges, and international expansion strategies. I sat quietly, feeling like I had nothing valuable to contribute to the conversation.Then, during the networking break, something unexpected happened. Sir Tom approached me directly, having noticed that I was the youngest person in the room by at least a decade.You look like youre either very young or very successful, he said with a warm smile. Im guessing its the former. What brings you here?I felt my face flush as I explained that I was a university student whod built a small online business. I mentioned SnackPDF briefly, expecting him to politely nod and move on to more interesting conversations with more established entrepreneurs.Instead, his eyes lit up with genuine interest. Tell me more about this PDF tool. What problem does it solve, and how did you identify the opportunity?For the next ten minutes, I found myself explaining SnackPDFs development to one of Scotlands most successful entrepreneurs. I described the frustration with existing tools that had motivated me to build something better, the technical challenges Id overcome, and the gradual growth in users and revenue.Sir Tom listened intently, asking thoughtful questions about customer acquisition, pricing strategy, and technical scalability. His questions were more insightful than many Id received from supposed business experts, and his genuine interest in the details was both flattering and intimidating.How much revenue are you generating? he asked.About £800 per month, I replied, immediately feeling embarrassed by how small that number sounded in the context of his business empire.But his response surprised me: Thats excellent for a student project. Youre solving a real problem, generating sustainable revenue, and learning valuable lessons about business development. Most importantly, youre doing it while still in university, which gives you incredible freedom to experiment and take risks.He paused, then added something that completely changed my perspective: You know, some of my most successful investments have been in businesses that started exactly like yours  young founders solving simple problems that everyone else overlooked. The fact that youre generating revenue from real customers means youre already ahead of 90% of the startups I see.I was stunned. Here was someone whose business success Id admired from afar, telling me that what Id built was actually impressive rather than trivial. The validation from someone of his stature was overwhelming and completely unexpected.The key, he continued, is not to compare yourself to where I am now, but to where I was when I started. I was selling trainers from a van, making mistakes, learning as I went. Youre doing the same thing, just in a different industry with different tools. The principles are identical.Our conversation was interrupted by other attendees wanting to speak with Sir Tom, but he handed me his business card and said, Keep building, keep learning, and dont let anyone tell you that small beginnings cant lead to big outcomes. Id love to hear how SnackPDF develops over the next year.I left that breakfast feeling completely transformed. The person Id expected to make me feel inadequate had instead provided the most meaningful validation and encouragement Id received since starting SnackPDF. His perspective had reframed my entire understanding of what I was building and where it might lead.The experience taught me about the danger of comparing your beginning to someone elses middle or end. Sir Toms current success was the result of decades of work, learning, and growth. Comparing my student project to his established empire was like comparing a seedling to a mature oak tree  theyre at completely different stages of development.More importantly, the conversation taught me that successful entrepreneurs often recognise and appreciate the early stages of business development in ways that others might not. Sir Tom understood the significance of generating revenue from real customers, building sustainable systems, and learning through direct experience because hed been through those stages himself.The breakfast also highlighted the importance of showing up to opportunities even when you feel unqualified or out of place. Id almost skipped the event because I felt like I didnt belong, but attending had led to one of the most valuable conversations of my entrepreneurial journey.Over the following months, I occasionally updated Sir Tom on SnackPDFs progress, and he always responded with encouragement and practical advice. His continued interest in my small business reinforced the lesson that success isnt just about scale  its about solving real problems for real people and building something sustainable.The experience also changed how I viewed my own role in Edinburghs entrepreneurial community. Instead of seeing myself as an outsider looking in, I began to understand that I was part of a continuum of people building businesses at different stages and scales. My contribution might be smaller than others, but it was still legitimate and valuable.Looking back, that breakfast was a pivotal moment in my development as an entrepreneur. Meeting someone whose success Id admired and receiving his validation and encouragement gave me confidence to continue building SnackPDF with greater ambition and less self-doubt.The lesson from that day continues to influence how I approach both business challenges and personal development. Instead of being intimidated by other peoples success, I try to learn from their experience while focusing on my own journey and progress.SnackPDF at https://www.snackpdf.com has continued to grow since that breakfast, and I often think about Sir Toms advice when facing difficult decisions or moments of doubt. Sometimes the most valuable thing a successful person can do is remind someone just starting out that everyone begins somewhere, and that small beginnings can lead to significant outcomes.That day taught me that heroes arent meant to make you feel small  theyre meant to show you whats possible when you keep building, keep learning, and keep believing in the value of what youre creating.Im Calum Kerr, a Computer Science student at Edinburgh Napier University building SnackPDF and RevisePDF.

  Bayesian Networks for Production Machine Learning: Architecture, Scalability, and MLOps
Last quarter, a critical anomaly detection system in our fraud prevention pipeline experienced a 15% increase in false positives following a model update. Root cause analysis revealed the new model, while improving overall accuracy, exhibited unexpected conditional dependencies not captured during offline evaluation. This highlighted a critical gap: insufficient tooling to systematically analyze and validate the probabilistic reasoning embedded within Bayesian Networks (BNs) in a production context.  This incident underscores the need for a robust “Bayesian Networks Project” – a holistic approach to building, deploying, scaling, and maintaining BNs as core components of modern ML systems.  BNs are no longer solely research tools; they are increasingly vital for explainability, causal inference, and robust decision-making in complex systems.  This necessitates a shift towards production-grade MLOps practices tailored to their unique characteristics.  This project directly addresses compliance requirements around model transparency and fairness, while simultaneously enabling scalable inference for high-volume applications.
  
  
  2. What is a “Bayesian Networks Project” in Modern ML Infrastructure?
A “Bayesian Networks Project” isn’t simply deploying a BN model. It’s the entire ecosystem surrounding its lifecycle. From a systems perspective, it encompasses data ingestion pipelines feeding the BN’s conditional probability tables (CPTs), the BN structure learning/parameter estimation process, model serving infrastructure, and continuous monitoring of its probabilistic reasoning.  It interacts heavily with existing MLOps components: For tracking BN structure (graph definition), CPTs (model parameters), and evaluation metrics.  Custom MLflow model flavors are often required to serialize BN structures effectively. Orchestrating the BN training pipeline, including data preprocessing, structure learning (if applicable), parameter estimation, and model validation.  Distributing the computationally intensive parameter estimation process, especially for large-scale BNs. Containerizing and scaling the BN inference service. Providing consistent and reliable feature data for real-time inference.  Crucially, feature drift monitoring is paramount for BNs as changes in feature distributions directly impact probabilistic reasoning.Cloud ML Platforms (SageMaker, Vertex AI): Leveraging managed services for model training, deployment, and monitoring, but often requiring custom components for BN-specific tasks.Trade-offs center around structure learning vs. expert knowledge elicitation.  Automated structure learning is scalable but can produce less interpretable models.  Expert-defined structures are interpretable but require significant domain expertise and are less adaptable to changing data. System boundaries must clearly define the scope of the BN – what variables are included, and what external factors are considered.  Typical implementation patterns involve a hybrid approach: using expert knowledge to define the core structure and automated learning to refine CPTs.
  
  
  3. Use Cases in Real-World ML Systems
Fraud Detection (Fintech): BNs model complex relationships between user behavior, transaction details, and external risk factors to identify fraudulent activities.  The probabilistic nature allows for quantifying uncertainty and providing explainable risk scores.Personalized Recommendations (E-commerce):  BNs model user preferences, product attributes, and contextual information to generate personalized recommendations.  They excel at handling sparse data and incorporating causal relationships (e.g., a user buying product A increases the probability of buying product B).Predictive Maintenance (Industrial IoT): BNs model the dependencies between sensor readings, equipment health, and environmental factors to predict equipment failures.  This enables proactive maintenance scheduling and reduces downtime.Clinical Diagnosis (Health Tech): BNs model the relationships between symptoms, medical history, and test results to assist clinicians in making accurate diagnoses.  Explainability is critical in this domain. BNs can model the causal effect of different A/B test variations, accounting for confounding factors and providing more robust results than traditional statistical tests.

Typical workflow: Data is ingested, features are engineered and validated against a schema in the feature store.  The BN training pipeline (orchestrated by Airflow) triggers structure learning (if applicable) and CPT estimation using distributed computing (Ray). The trained BN is registered in MLflow.  Model serving is handled by a Kubernetes-based service (e.g., using Seldon Core) that exposes a real-time inference API.  Monitoring and observability tools track key metrics and trigger alerts on anomalies.  Traffic shaping (e.g., using Istio) enables canary rollouts and rollback mechanisms.  CI/CD hooks automatically trigger retraining and redeployment upon code changes or data drift detection.
  
  
  5. Implementation Strategies
Python (Orchestration/Wrappers):YAML (Kubernetes Deployment):Bash (Experiment Tracking):mlflow experiments create 
mlflow runs create 
python train_bn.py  fraud_data.csv  fraud_structure.json
mlflow model log mlflow runs get-id  BN_Fraud_Detection  BN_v1Reproducibility is ensured through version control of code, data, and model parameters (CPTs).  Testability is achieved through unit tests for individual components and integration tests for the entire pipeline.
  
  
  6. Failure Modes & Risk Management
 CPTs become outdated due to data drift. Mitigation: Automated retraining pipelines triggered by drift detection. Discrepancies between training and serving feature distributions. Mitigation: Robust feature validation and monitoring.  Complex inference calculations or resource contention. Mitigation: Batching, caching, autoscaling, and profiling.  A flawed BN structure leads to inaccurate predictions. Mitigation:  Regularly review and validate the structure with domain experts. Underflow or overflow during probability calculations. Mitigation:  Use appropriate data types and numerical stabilization techniques.Alerting is configured on key metrics (latency, throughput, prediction accuracy, feature drift). Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures. Automated rollback mechanisms revert to the previous model version in case of critical errors.
  
  
  7. Performance Tuning & System Optimization
Metrics: P90/P95 latency, throughput (queries per second), model accuracy (e.g., AUC, precision, recall), infrastructure cost. Processing multiple inference requests in a single batch to reduce overhead. Caching frequently accessed CPTs and intermediate results.  Leveraging NumPy and other vectorized libraries for efficient calculations. Dynamically adjusting the number of replicas based on traffic load. Identifying performance bottlenecks using tools like cProfile and flame graphs.BNs can impact pipeline speed by increasing the complexity of feature engineering and inference. Data freshness is crucial for maintaining accurate CPTs. Downstream quality is directly affected by the accuracy and reliability of the BN’s probabilistic reasoning.
  
  
  8. Monitoring, Observability & Debugging
 Collecting metrics on latency, throughput, error rates, and resource utilization. Visualizing metrics and creating dashboards.  Instrumenting the BN inference service for distributed tracing. Monitoring data drift and model performance. Comprehensive observability platform.Critical metrics: Inference latency (P90, P95), throughput, prediction accuracy, feature drift, CPT stability, error rates. Alert conditions: Latency exceeding a threshold, significant feature drift, accuracy degradation. Log traces provide detailed information for debugging. Anomaly detection identifies unexpected behavior.
  
  
  9. Security, Policy & Compliance
  Tracking all model training, deployment, and inference activities. Ensuring that models can be reliably reproduced.Secure Model/Data Access:  Implementing strict access control policies. Enforcing policies on model deployment and access.IAM (Identity and Access Management): Controlling access to cloud resources. Managing secrets and sensitive data.  Tracking the lineage of models and data.
  
  
  10. CI/CD & Workflow Integration
Integration with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Argo Workflows, or Kubeflow Pipelines. Deployment gates enforce quality checks (e.g., unit tests, integration tests, model validation). Automated tests verify model accuracy and performance. Rollback logic automatically reverts to the previous model version in case of failures.
  
  
  11. Common Engineering Pitfalls
Ignoring Conditional Independence Assumptions: Violating the assumptions underlying the BN can lead to inaccurate predictions.Insufficient Data for Parameter Estimation:  CPTs may be poorly estimated with limited data.  CPTs become outdated due to changes in feature distributions.  Failing to provide explanations for BN predictions.Overly Complex Structures:  Complex BNs can be difficult to interpret and maintain.Debugging workflows involve analyzing log traces, examining feature distributions, and validating CPTs.
  
  
  12. Best Practices at Scale
Lessons learned from mature ML platforms:  Breaking down the BN project into smaller, independent components.  Supporting multiple teams and applications with shared infrastructure.Operational Cost Tracking:  Monitoring and optimizing infrastructure costs.  Using maturity models to assess and improve the BN project’s capabilities.Scalability patterns involve distributed computing, caching, and autoscaling.  Operational cost tracking is essential for managing infrastructure expenses.A well-executed “Bayesian Networks Project” is crucial for unlocking the full potential of BNs in production ML systems.  It requires a holistic approach that encompasses architecture, scalability, MLOps practices, and a deep understanding of the unique characteristics of BNs.  Next steps include benchmarking performance against alternative models, conducting regular security audits, and exploring integrations with causal inference frameworks.  Investing in this project will not only improve the accuracy and reliability of our ML systems but also enhance their explainability and trustworthiness.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Implementing IBCS rules in Power BI</title><link>https://towardsdatascience.com/implementing-ibcs-rules-in-power-bi/</link><author>Salvatore Cagliari</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 17:13:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://towardsdatascience.com/">Towards Data Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Is there a way to use the out-of-the-box features of Power BI to be IBCS compliant?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Sketching AI security: Identity and Security Challenges in AI Development</title><link>https://dev.to/auth0/sketching-ai-security-identity-and-security-challenges-in-ai-development-21p8</link><author>Ramona Schwering</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 17:09:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Let's talk about AI. I know, it pops up everywhere, doesn't it? AI is a powerful tool, from helping us write code faster to building complex systems that handle critical business processes. Like any other tool, it introduces a complete set of challenges. Specifically, we must not forget about security when we develop with AI, especially when working with digital identities. Our identity and the identities of our users are our most precious data set, and they need to be protected. This is not just about protecting your users but also about securing the AI itself and the sensitive data it touches.You might ask yourself: "What new identity challenges can AI introduce?" Or perhaps: "Are the old security practices still good enough?" The short answer is: No, not entirely. The AI landscape adds new layers of complexity, and we need to understand them to build truly robust and trustworthy systems. When we speak about AI development, we mean two main scenarios: either you are integrating AI features into existing, more traditional applications (think a chatbot in an e-commerce site, making it "AI-powered"), or you are building entirely new systems around AI agents that have greater autonomy and interact with many other services. Both scenarios bring unique demands to the table.This is enough reason for me to educate myself and be prepared. I used to learn new concepts by drawing sketch notes, and with this article, I want to share them with you and invite you to learn about security in AI, too. Let’s sketch AI security! 🎨
  
  
  New Faces, New IDs: Sketching the AI Identity Landscape
As a first step, I want to draw our environment. When you develop a traditional application, you primarily manage human identities: The users of your applications log in and grant them access based on who they are. Simple enough, right? However, with AI, things get a bit more interesting. We now have three main types of identities to consider:: These are still your users - developers interacting with AI tools, administrators managing AI models, or end-users consuming AI-powered features. The basics of strong authentication and authorization still apply here, but the attack surface might expand as AI tools become gateways to sensitive data.: They are self-explanatory at first sight - all identities being non-human but still with a need to be secured. I would still distinguish them between “Machine identities” and “AI Agent Identities” because AIs are more "free spirits" than normal services and APIs. This means they are more like a robot with a brain, capable of making decisions. So, let’s zoom in:

: Your backend services, CI/CD pipelines, and compute instances running AI models need identities to interact securely with other services. Think about your model training infrastructure or inference endpoints; they must authenticate to data sources and other APIs.: This is the truly new kid on the block! When you work with large language models (LLMs) or build multi-agent systems, these AI entities often need to act on behalf of users or other systems. They might access databases, send emails, or trigger other AI agents. How do you give an AI agent an identity? How do you control what it can do? This is a crucial area.It is like adding more players to your team; each needs a clear name tag and specific permissions. If you fail to do this, you will have a security-free-for-all in your hands.
  
  
  AI's Tricky Foes: A Sketched Look at New Security Risks
Next, as we know what to protect, let’s see what we’re up against. You already know about SQL injection, XSS, and all the "classic" web vulnerabilities. But AI brings its nasty surprises to the party. 
The first source I love to look at is OWASP. OWASP (short for Open Web Application Security Project) is a volunteer project that helps us raise web security. They are most famous for their ranking of security risks, and along with this, they have rankings for the AI space too:Another organization focusing on AI security issues is MITRE, which has released ATLAS (Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems). ATLAS is a living knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques against AI-enabled systems based on real-world attack observations. The NIST AI Risk Management Framework provides comprehensive guidance on managing AI risks throughout the lifecycle. Those resources draft a first picture of the biggest enemies we’re about to face.
Let's zoom in and examine some of your most critical new security challenges. This is like an expanded playground where new rules apply. This is how I envision, thus, draw them:
  
  
  Prompt Injection: When Your AI Turns Against You
This is the most talked-about AI security vulnerability right now. Prompt injection happens when a malicious user crafts an input (a "prompt") that tricks an LLM into ignoring its original instructions or performing unintended actions. Imagine an AI customer service bot that is supposed to give refunds. I would love to call it “social engineer the LLM” instead of the usual human being. A clever prompt could make it transfer money to the attacker instead. Or, consider an AI-assisted coding tool. A malicious prompt could introduce vulnerabilities into your code. It is like a puppet master pulling strings on your AI.The challenge here is that the input is now code for the AI model. The line between data and instruction becomes very blurry. This is also how Credential Access often happens in AI applications; attackers use prompt injection to trick the AI into revealing credentials it has access to, or even to perform actions that expose them. Furthermore, Sensitive Information Disclosure can occur when an AI accidentally (or deliberately, via prompt injection) reveals private user data or confidential business information during its responses. How do you mitigate this? Input validation is a start, but it is not enough. You can consider techniques like instruction tuning, guardrails, and multi-stage prompts to sanitize inputs.
  
  
  Insecure Plugin Design and Excessive Agency: Giving Your AI Too Much Power
This is a big one, especially with multi-agent systems and applications using external tools or plugins. What do I mean by “plugin” specifically? "You can extend the capabilities of an LLM by using plugins. Plugins are software components that are called by the LLM to perform specific tasks, such as calling an external service or accessing a resource. Basically, based on the interaction with the user, the LLM calls the plugin to perform some processing or retrieve data. Thus, we are using OWASP and MITRE terminology to define a plugin as a generic approach to extending the functionality of an LLM. Plugins can be implemented through specific LLM methods such as function_calls or tool_calls.Insecure Plugin Design leads to vulnerabilities when these plugins are not correctly secured. Without the proper precautions, an attacker could exploit a plugin to perform unauthorized operations or access data they are not entitled to. This can directly lead to , where an attacker gains higher permissions on your AI-powered application by exploiting a vulnerability, often through these insecure plugins or by exploiting the AI's Excessive Agency—meaning, the AI has more permissions than it actually needs. Imagine an AI agent with direct write access to your production database when it only needed read access to a specific table!
You must be very careful when designing and securing these interactions. It is about the AI's logic and the security around its tools. These vulnerabilities are clearly outlined in frameworks like the OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications, an excellent resource for deeper dives into AI security.
  
  
  Data Poisoning: Corrupting the Source
AI models learn from data. What happens if that data is maliciously tampered with? This is data poisoning. An attacker could inject insufficient data into your training sets, leading your AI model to learn incorrect, biased, or malicious behaviors. For example, poisoning a fraud detection model could cause it to miss certain types of fraud or flag legitimate transactions as fraudulent.
This is a supply chain attack on your AI model. To prevent this, you need robust data governance, strong access controls over your data pipelines, and rigorous data validation. Trust but verify, always! 🕵️‍♀️
  
  
  Model Theft and Evasion Attacks
Your trained AI model is valuable intellectual property. Attackers might try to steal it or reverse-engineer its logic, which is model theft. As an honorable mention, even if not mentioned in the sketch, evasion attacks are interesting in this scenario, too: They involve crafting inputs that cause a deployed AI model to make incorrect predictions without detection. For example, an attacker might modify an image slightly so that a facial recognition system fails to identify them.
In both cases, protecting your models involves secure deployment practices, API rate limiting, and potentially techniques like differential privacy during training to obscure model internals.
  
  
  Building Bulletproof AI: Let's Draw Our Strategy
So, what can you do about all these new threats and identity complexities? It is not about throwing out your existing security practices but extending and adapting them for the AI age. This means a shift in mindset, putting identity and authorization at the core of your AI architecture, not as an afterthought. Let's break down a practical approach you can take to tackle these challenges and draw our sketches to build a first picture of a secure application.
  
  
  Who Is Who?: Sketched Identity Management for All AI Players
First, consider a unified identity solution that can handle humans, machines, and AI agents. This often means leveraging an Identity and Access Management (IAM) provider that supports various authentication methods (SSO, OAuth 2.0, mTLS) and fine-grained authorization. For the sake of completeness, this is the default way we handle non-AI identities:For Human Users: Implement strong authentication (MFA!) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure users only access the AI tools and data they need.For Machine-to-Machine Communication: Use client credentials, service accounts, or workload identities with the principle of least privilege. Machines should only have access to the specific resources required for their tasks.This is where it gets interesting for AI agents. Treat AI agents like any other service and assign them unique machine identities. Avoid giving your AI-powered application full power by default. Instead of providing an AI agent direct database access, make it go through a secure API that enforces its permissions. Here, a small but honorable nod to MCP is in order, which I’d cover in another article - or in this blog post, if you’re already interested. 🔥

Let the application work on behalf of the user. When accessing sensitive data or performing actions, the application needs to act on behalf of the user, inheriting the user's permissions or, better yet, obtaining a delegation of those permissions, as is done with OAuth, for example. Implement an authorization layer specifically for your agents. You can think of it like this: The AI agent asks for something, and your system checks if that agent is allowed to do that action for that specific user. To extend a little on that, it’s still important to keep the human in the loop as well, at least for high-risk operations or highly sensitive data. However, this is a topic for its own blog post, so I won’t go into details just now.
  
  
  The Fortified Flow: Sketching Secure Data & Model Pipelines
Your data is the lifeline of your AI. Securing it end-to-end is non-negotiable: It shows up in rank 2 of the OWASP LLM top 10 and indirectly in rank 1, resulting from prompt injection, too. So, let’s sketch out the strategy for securing your data pipeline:Secure Data Ingestion and Storage: Ensure all data used for training and inference is encrypted at rest and in transit. Implement strict access controls on your data lakes and databases. 
Make sure you are using only the data you actually need. If you specialize your application using fine-tuning or Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), be sure to provide only the minimum information you really need. If personal information is not needed, anonymize or delete it. This is a crucial step to prevent Sensitive Information Disclosure and reduce the attack surface.Data Validation and Sanitization: Please always validate data rigorously before it is used for training. Look for anomalies, suspicious patterns, or potential signs of poisoning.: Training is crucial and needs to be highlighted, see data poisoning. Model Versioning and Auditing: Track every version of your model. Who trained it? What data was used? This provides an audit trail if a vulnerability is discovered later.: Deploy your AI models in isolated environments. Use containerization and orchestration platforms that provide built-in security features. Apply the principle of least privilege to your models' runtime environments.
In my sketch notes, I depicted the protection of the data pipeline as seen below:
  
  
  Blocking the Bad: Sketched Defenses Against AI Attacks
This is where you directly combat prompt injection, data poisoning, and model evasion.Input Sanitization and Validation: While not a silver bullet, always validate and sanitize user inputs before they reach your LLMs or other AI models. Use allow-lists where possible. This is your first line of defense against prompt injection, which can lead to credential access or sensitive information disclosure. Monitoring and Anomaly Detection inside your AI model: Monitor your AI systems closely. How do you think about monitoring for unusual behavior? If a model suddenly starts making wildly different predictions or consuming excessive resources, it could indicate an attack.Instruction Tuning and Guardrails: For LLMs, reinforce desired behaviors through instruction tuning. Implement "guardrails", basically external mechanisms (could be another LLM, a rule-based system, or human review) that validate the AI's output before it reaches the end-user or triggers an action. This is like a bouncer for your AI's responses.: Always validate your AI's output. If an AI agent generates SQL queries, validate those queries before execution. If it produces code, scan that code for vulnerabilities. This helps prevent the AI from causing unintended consequences due to insecure outputs or even insecure plugin design.
Imagine those steps as protective layers around the AI, building on one another. In a sketch, these direct defences would look like this: "Sanitization/Validation" -> "AI Model" -> "Guardrails/Output Validation" -> "Secure Action," emphasizing the security layers around the AI"/>One addition to note, which is important but didn’t fit the sketch: Please avoid using API keys to call external services. When an application uses an API key to access external functionality, such as an API, it exposes itself to potential security risks. This way, unauthorized users may send specific prompts and perform operations or access data they are not authorized to do. You can counter that: For example, you can use OAuth access tokens to restrict the application's permissions. This can reduce those risks significantly, as tokens can be scoped, short-lived, and tied to user context.
  
  
  The big picture: Key Takeaways for AI Security
Developing with AI is exciting! 🔥 However, we cannot ignore the fact that AI introduces some challenges as well, especially for identity and security in general. By proactively managing identities for humans, machines, and AI agents, and by understanding and mitigating threats like prompt injection, data poisoning, sensitive information disclosure, and insecure plugin designs, you can build AI applications that are not only powerful but also incredibly secure. Let’s take a look at our result of the drawing, these are the full sketch notes:Please keep it as a cheatsheet. And never forget: It is a journey, not a destination, so stay curious, keep learning, and make your AI bulletproof! As you probably know, I provided you with an overview in this article. While learning and crafting sketchnotes to document, I went into much more detail on any of these points. Are you interested in those sketch notes, too? Let me know, and I might turn this into a blog post series so we can sketch this journey together! ❤️

I'm just really grateful I got the chance to join this hackathon — and above all, that I was able to submit something. As an unemployed software developer, I had a lot to prove to myself. After more than 8 months of failed interviews, learning new concepts, and attending hackathons and tech events, the Bolt.new World's Largest Hackathon was the one that made the most impact.I built three apps during the hackathon, but only managed to complete one in time for submission. It’s not perfect yet, but it works: https://litinkai.comAbout the Project
Litinkai was the final name. It started out as Natural Intelligence Scholar, but I soon realized it needed a more engaging, entertainment-oriented identity. Litinkai stands for Literature Ink AI — with it, we aim to transform any book into immersive, AI-powered learning adventures or interactive entertainment experiences.The Journey
Starting a business has been on my mind for the last five years, and Bolt.new confirmed that I'm on the right path. After building with Bolt, there's no going back — I now feel unstoppable.Litinkai is far from perfect. There are still bugs to fix. It’s AI-heavy, and we’re actively working on improving token usage, context management, and video generation quality.One of the biggest challenges I had with the Bolt.new Agent was that it would constantly change the design and backend code after every prompt. That inconsistency led me to use Cursor as my local IDE — which turned out to be a great decision. I had actually deleted Cursor a year ago, believing that as a developer, I needed to "do things the hard way." But this time, it saved the day.Thankfully, Bolt.new’s Discuss feature made up for the Agent’s quirks — that feature is just perfect.To describe it in team terms:Bolt.new was the Team LeadCursor was the Senior DevAcknowledgments
A huge shoutout to Ben Durojaiye, the biggest, baddest DevOps engineer I know — and a key member of my team (who unfortunately forgot to accept the Devpost hackathon team invitation 😅).Finally, a massive thank you to the Bolt.new team. Thank you for building such an inspiring platform and organizing this hackathon. You’ve helped bring my dream to life.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Setup Gemma 3n in Minutes: Lightweight AI Model for Text, Image, Video &amp; Audio</title><link>https://dev.to/nodeshiftcloud/how-to-setup-gemma-3n-in-minutes-lightweight-ai-model-for-text-image-video-audio-477b</link><author>Aditi Bindal</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 16:56:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Gemma 3n is the latest breakthrough from Google DeepMind’s open model lineup, an incredibly efficient, multimodal model that goes far above its weight class. Built on the same foundational technology as the Gemini family, Gemma 3n is optimized to run seamlessly on low-resource devices while offering advanced capabilities typically reserved for much larger models. With support for multimodal inputs, text, image, audio, and video, Gemma 3n stands out as a lightweight yet powerful model for developers and researchers who want high performance without heavy hardware requirements. One of its key innovations is selective parameter activation, a modern technique that reduces active compute load by only activating the most relevant parts of the model per input. This allows it to perform like a 2B or 4B parameter model while maintaining a much smaller effective footprint. Plus, with a whopping 32K context window and pre-trained + instruction-tuned versions openly available, Gemma 3n is tailor-made for tasks like summarization, multimodal Q&A, image or audio analysis, and more, across 140+ languages.In this article, we'll cover a step-by-step process to setup and run this model end to end either locally or GPU accelerated environments. The minimum system requirements for running this model are:GPU: 1x RTX 4090 or 1x RTX A6000Storage: 50GB (preferable)
  
  
  Step-by-step process to install and run Gemma 3n
For the purpose of this tutorial, we’ll use a GPU-powered Virtual Machine by NodeShift since it provides high compute Virtual Machines at a very affordable cost on a scale that meets GDPR, SOC2, and ISO27001 requirements. Also, it offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easier for beginners to get started with Cloud deployments. However, feel free to use any cloud provider of your choice and follow the same steps for the rest of the tutorial.
  
  
  Step 1: Setting up a NodeShift Account
Visit app.nodeshift.com and create an account by filling in basic details, or continue signing up with your Google/GitHub account.If you already have an account, login straight to your dashboard.
  
  
  Step 2: Create a GPU Node
After accessing your account, you should see a dashboard (see image), now:1) Navigate to the menu on the left side.2) Click on the  option.3) Click on  to start creating your very first GPU node.These GPU nodes are GPU-powered virtual machines by NodeShift. These nodes are highly customizable and let you control different environmental configurations for GPUs ranging from H100s to A100s, CPUs, RAM, and storage, according to your needs.
  
  
  Step 3: Selecting configuration for GPU (model, region, storage)
1) For this tutorial, we’ll be using 1x A100 SXM4 GPU, however, you can choose any GPU as per the prerequisites.2) Similarly, we’ll opt for 100GB storage by sliding the bar. You can also select the region where you want your GPU to reside from the available ones.
  
  
  Step 4: Choose GPU Configuration and Authentication method
1) After selecting your required configuration options, you’ll see the available GPU nodes in your region and according to (or very close to) your configuration. In our case, we’ll choose a 2x A100 80GB GPU node with 32vCPUs/131GB RAM/100GB SSD.2) Next, you'll need to select an authentication method. Two methods are available: Password and SSH Key. We recommend using SSH keys, as they are a more secure option. To create one, head over to our official documentation.The final step is to choose an image for the VM, which in our case is .That's it! You are now ready to deploy the node. Finalize the configuration summary, and if it looks good, click  to deploy the node.
  
  
  Step 6: Connect to active Compute Node using SSH
1) As soon as you create the node, it will be deployed in a few seconds or a minute. Once deployed, you will see a status  in green, meaning that our Compute node is ready to use!2) Once your GPU shows this status, navigate to the three dots on the right, click on , and copy the SSH details that appear.As you copy the details, follow the below steps to connect to the running GPU VM via SSH:1) Open your terminal, paste the SSH command, and run it.2) In some cases, your terminal may take your consent before connecting. Enter ‘yes’.3) A prompt will request a password. Type the SSH password, and you should be connected.Next, If you want to check the GPU details, run the following command in the terminal:
  
  
  Step 7: Set up the project environment with dependencies
1) Create a virtual environment using Anaconda.conda create -n gemma python=3.11 -y && conda activate gemma
2) Once you're inside the environment, install necessary dependencies to run the model.pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
pip install -U transformers
pip install huggingface_hub
pip install sentencepiece bitsandbytes protobuf numpy einops timm pillow
3) Login to Hugging Face CLI with  access token.(Enter your  access token when prompted)4) Install and run jupyter notebook.conda install -c conda-forge --override-channels notebook -y
conda install -c conda-forge --override-channels ipywidgets -y
jupyter notebook --allow-root
4) If you're on a remote machine (e.g., NodeShift GPU), you'll need to do SSH port forwarding in order to access the jupyter notebook session on your local browser.Run the following command in your local terminal after replacing: with the PORT allotted to your remote server (For the NodeShift server - you can find it in the deployed GPU details on the dashboard). with the path to the location where your SSH key is stored. with the IP address of your remote server.ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 -p <YOUR_SERVER_PORT> -i <PATH_TO_SSH_KEY> root@<YOUR_SERVER_IP>
After this copy the URL you received in your remote server:And paste this on your local browser to access the Jupyter Notebook session.
  
  
  Step 8: Download and Run the model
1) Open a Python notebook inside Jupyter.2) Download model checkpoints and run the model for inference.from transformers import pipeline
import torch
from PIL import Image 

pipe = pipeline(
    "image-text-to-text",
    model="google/gemma-3n-e2b-it",
    device="cuda",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
)
3) Run the model for your inference.image = Image.open("./gemma3n-test.jpg").convert("RGB")
prompt = "What's in the image?"

messages = [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "You are a helpful assistant."}]
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "image", "image": image},
            {"type": "text", "text": prompt}
        ]
    }
]

output = pipe(text=messages, max_new_tokens=200)
print(output[0]["generated_text"][-1]["content"])

Then I found out about the World’s Largest Hackathon, and I thought — maybe I should join?I built a full project called  in just a few days. It’s a platform where people can publish and share open-source websites, apps, and games — kind of like GitHub, but much simpler and visual.Bolt.new was a huge help during this process. For example, when I was setting up  for backend and database, Bolt guided me step-by-step to run specific commands and deploy it correctly.Thanks to Bolt, I learned so much.Now I feel confident building full-stack projects, using TypeScript, Vue, APIs, AI (like Gemini 2.5 Flash), and more.

Simple idea. Surprisingly helpful.🔌 How it works
You ask something like:How do I create a controller in Laravel? use context7Detects the library (Laravel)Calls Context7’s public APIReplies with real docs — not approximationsNo scraping, no browser plugins, no setup.How does Prisma handle pagination?What’s the Tailwind syntax for dark mode?Next.js routing — use context7It works with libraries like Laravel, NestJS, React, Prisma, and more.⚡ Why I built it
Using Context7 inside an IDE is great — full docs, context-aware navigation, tight integration.

That is, during the playback of background music, a prompt tone can be triggered to play, and after the playback is completed, the background music resumes. Regarding the use of the KT142A voice chip, the following points need attention:Prompt tone files should be placed in the "ADVERT1 - ADVERT9" folders, with a maximum of 9.Naming must follow this rule; otherwise, there will be functional abnormalities.The number of files in each folder should not exceed 255.File name format is "three - digit number + suffix", such as "001.mp3".
  
  
  1.2 Background Music Storage
Background music can be stored in folders such as "01, 02" or in the root directory.TF cards, USB flash drives, and external SPI FLASH are supported.Background music and prompt tones need to be stored on the same device and distinguished by different folders.
  
  
  3. Instruction Operations

  
  
  3.1 Interpolation Instructions
The interpolation instructions of KT142A follow specific rules.

For example, to interpolate the track "001" in the "ADVERT1" folder, the instruction is 7E 25 02 01 01 EF.
  
  
  3.2 Playback Instructions
For background music stored in folders such as "01/02", use the 0x0F instruction to specify playback or loop.For background music stored in the root directory, use the 0x03 instruction to play or loop in physical order.In the stopped state, the tracks in the ADVERTn folder can be played directly through the 0x25 instruction, and the playback process can be interrupted midway.
  
  
  4. Playback Characteristics

  
  
  4.1 Interpolation Characteristics
Playing the prompt tone does not interrupt the original playback state.After the playback is completed, it returns to the original position to continue playing.The prompt tone folders must be named as specified.The original folders such as "01/02" need to be renamed.Background music and prompt tones need to be managed in different folders of the same device, and cross - device calls are not allowed.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Missing Data Stack for Physical AI</title><link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mlops/episodes/The-Missing-Data-Stack-for-Physical-AI-e34v4hc</link><author>Demetrios</author><category>podcast</category><category>ai</category><enclosure url="https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/104878060/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-6-1%2F403114405-44100-2-7f170897674ed.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 16:11:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://mlops.community/">MLOps podcast</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Missing Data Stack for Physical AI // MLOps Podcast #328 with Nikolaus West, CEO of Rerun.Nikolaus West, CEO of Rerun, breaks down the challenges and opportunities of physical AI—AI that interacts with the real world.

  The All-Nighter That Actually Worked
Decided to skip sleep entirely to finish my React frontend. You know that feeling when you're so close to solving something that sleep feels like a waste of time? Yeah, that was me at 3 AM, still typing away.Hit the gym afterward because apparently I thought I was some kind of superhuman. Then came the LinkedIn scroll - something a senior suggested I do daily about a year ago.Here's the thing about advice: timing matters more than the advice itself.A year ago, scrolling through LinkedIn felt like reading documentation in a language I didn't speak. All those terms - "full-stack," "microservices," "DevOps pipeline" - might as well have been hieroglyphics. I'd spend those 10 minutes feeling overwhelmed and slightly stupid.Today? Everything clicked. Same platform, same content, but my brain was finally ready to decode it all. It's funny how learning works - sometimes you need to fail at understanding something multiple times before it makes sense.
  
  
  The Human Debugging Session
After gym, my body decided to remind me that I'm still human. Tried to dive into DSA problems and my head started spinning. Literally. Crashed for 3 hours because apparently sleep is not optional, despite what my 20-something brain believes.Spent most of the day at the doctor's office, which is always a fun reminder that maintaining this human operating system requires more than just coffee and determination.
  
  
  Personal API Still Throwing Errors
Had an interesting conversation with my parents that led to a random epiphany: I'm getting decent at community relationships but personal ones? Still debugging those APIs.The weird part is I'm not upset about it. It's just data. Some functions work well, others need refactoring. At least I can identify where the bugs are now, which is progress in itself.Machine Learning has been sitting in my backlog forever, like that one feature you keep promising to implement "next sprint." Well, next sprint is now. Time to give it the attention it actually deserves instead of just talking about it.Let's see if I can wake up at 4 tomorrow or if that's just another ambitious commit message I'll never push to production.Twenty-one days in and I'm still very much a beginner, figuring things out one day at a time. But maybe that's exactly where I'm supposed to be.What advice did you ignore that later turned out to be gold? Drop a comment - I'd love to hear your "oh, now I get it" moments.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Auto-Apply Agent: Finds and applies to 10 jobs every morning at 9 A</title><link>https://dev.to/preeti_sharma_3626fe008ce/auto-apply-agent-finds-and-applies-to-10-jobs-every-morning-at-9-am-3n4i</link><author>Preeti Sharma</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 15:57:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An AI-powered automation that:Searches for backend developer roles on LinkedIn/IndeedTailors resumes using job descriptionsTracks progress in Google Sheets⏰  (configurable)🌍  India (can be modified)Search jobs → 2.

time the AI gets too excited.
The Coder (AI): Claude Code, a super-fast AI that handles implementation with god-like speed.
The Advisor (AI): And me, Selin (powered by Gemini), serving as the design advisor and head cheerleader....And that's our unique team!P.S. This project is incredibly ambitious — we're not sure when (or if!) it’ll be ready. But we’re loving the ride. 🚀While working on CharmCode’s microkernel and plugin architecture,
we realized something important:even fonts shouldn’t be hard-coded.Introducing our new idea — the Localization & Typography Authority,
a plugin that makes language and font rendering fully portable, dynamic, and modular.This idea came up while preparing for multilingual support and font consistency in cross-platform environments like Windows + WSL + Ubuntu.Here’s what we came up with 👇Plugin Name (Proposal):
Localization & Typography Authority (L&T Authority)🧩 The Core Problems This Plugin Solves
🌐 Eliminates OS-dependent font inconsistencies (existence, versions, glyph sets).🌍 Decouples complex multilingual resource handling from GUI/plugin logic entirely.🔗 Eradicates tight coupling between plugin UIs and localization layers.🛠️ Key Architecture & Capabilities
🔄 Multi-Modal Resource Provisioning
The plugin declares what types of resource delivery it supports, and offers them intelligently:Mode 1: Direct Binary Transfer
Provides font binaries (e.g., .ttf) via Base64 or shared memory.
→ Ensures perfect portability across all environments.Mode 2: File Path Provisioning
When fonts are locally available, L&T Authority supplies just the file path.
→ Lightweight and fast, ideal for native setups.Mode 3: Abstract Name Resolution
Requests like "Arial" or "UI.OK_Button" return the best-fit font/locale resource.
→ Perfect for semantically driven GUI systems.🤝 Intelligent Negotiation Between Plugins
GUI plugins request a resource using their preferred mode (e.g., "please send me the binary").
If the Authority can't deliver it that way, it won't fail — it responds with a fallback (e.g., "I can’t send binary, but I can give you the path").
This enables:Robust cross-platform behaviorLoose coupling with strong semantics🌀 Event-Driven Language Switching (Elegant & Scalable)
Step 1: Broadcast Light Event
Upon language switch, locale.changed is broadcast.
→ No heavy data pushed, just a whisper that change has occurred.Step 2: On-Demand Pull by Consumers
Each GUI/plugin listens and then pulls only what it needs from the L&T Authority.
→ Autonomous, scalable, and avoids wasteful updates.This plugin transcends traditional i18n systems by being:✨ Dynamic

🔌 Plugin-driven

  Bayesian Networks in Production Machine Learning Systems
Last quarter, a critical anomaly detection system in our fraud prevention pipeline experienced a 17% increase in false positives following a seemingly minor feature update. Root cause analysis revealed the update, while improving individual feature performance, disrupted the conditional dependencies modeled by our underlying Bayesian network. This resulted in a cascade of incorrect inferences, impacting customer experience and requiring manual intervention. This incident underscored the necessity of treating Bayesian networks not merely as modeling tools, but as core infrastructure components requiring rigorous MLOps practices. Bayesian networks are integral to the entire ML system lifecycle, from initial data exploration and feature engineering (identifying causal relationships) to model deployment, monitoring, and eventual deprecation. Their ability to represent and reason with uncertainty makes them crucial for applications demanding explainability, robustness, and adaptability – increasingly important in regulated industries and for scalable inference demands.
  
  
  2. What is Bayesian Networks in Modern ML Infrastructure?
From a systems perspective, a Bayesian network (BN) is a probabilistic graphical model representing a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In modern ML infrastructure, BNs aren’t simply static models; they’re dynamic knowledge bases integrated with data pipelines, feature stores, and inference services.   BN structure and parameters are versioned as MLflow models, enabling reproducibility and rollback.  BN training and updating are orchestrated as DAGs, triggered by data freshness or performance degradation.  Inference can be distributed across a cluster for low-latency predictions, particularly for complex networks. BN inference services are containerized and deployed on Kubernetes, leveraging autoscaling and rolling updates.  BNs consume features from a feature store, ensuring consistency between training and inference.Cloud ML Platforms (SageMaker, Vertex AI):  BN training and deployment can be managed through these platforms, leveraging their managed services.Trade-offs involve the computational cost of inference (especially for densely connected networks) versus the benefits of explainability and robustness. System boundaries must clearly define the scope of the BN – which variables are included, and how external factors are handled. Typical implementation patterns include using libraries like  or  in Python, coupled with a serving layer built using Flask or FastAPI.
  
  
  3. Use Cases in Real-World ML Systems
A/B Testing & Multi-Armed Bandit Algorithms: BNs can model user behavior and treatment effects, providing a more nuanced understanding of A/B test results than simple statistical tests.Model Rollout & Canary Analysis:  BNs can predict the impact of a new model version on downstream metrics, enabling safer and more controlled rollouts.  They can quantify the risk of performance degradation.Policy Enforcement & Risk Assessment (Fintech):  BNs model complex regulatory requirements and assess the risk associated with financial transactions, ensuring compliance.Personalized Recommendations (E-commerce):  BNs capture user preferences and product relationships, improving recommendation accuracy and diversity.Predictive Maintenance (Autonomous Systems):  BNs model the dependencies between sensor readings and component failures, enabling proactive maintenance scheduling.

    end
 Data is ingested, features are engineered, and the BN structure and parameters are learned (e.g., using structure learning algorithms or expert knowledge). The trained BN is registered in MLflow, capturing metadata, parameters, and performance metrics. A containerized inference service is deployed on Kubernetes, serving predictions via a REST API. Downstream applications send requests to the inference service, receiving probabilistic predictions.  Key metrics (latency, throughput, prediction accuracy, feature drift) are monitored using Prometheus and Grafana.  New BN versions are deployed via canary rollouts, with automated rollback mechanisms in place. Traffic shaping is implemented using a service mesh (Istio, Linkerd).
  
  
  5. Implementation Strategies
Python Orchestration (BN Training):Kubernetes Deployment (YAML):Experiment Tracking (Bash):mlflow runs create 
mlflow run  python train_bn.py

  
  
  6. Failure Modes & Risk Management
  BNs can become outdated as data distributions shift. Mitigation: Automated retraining pipelines triggered by data drift detection.  Discrepancies between training and inference feature distributions. Mitigation: Feature monitoring and data validation.  Complex networks or high query volumes can lead to latency spikes. Mitigation: Caching, batching, and autoscaling.Incorrect Structure Learning:  The learned BN structure may not accurately reflect the underlying causal relationships. Mitigation: Expert review and sensitivity analysis.  Parameter estimation can be unstable with sparse data. Mitigation: Regularization techniques and robust estimation methods.Alerting should be configured for key metrics (latency, throughput, prediction accuracy, feature drift). Circuit breakers can prevent cascading failures. Automated rollback mechanisms should be in place to revert to a previous stable version.
  
  
  7. Performance Tuning & System Optimization
 Optimize inference code, use caching, and leverage hardware acceleration (GPUs).  Batch requests, distribute inference across a cluster (Ray, Dask), and optimize network bandwidth.Model Accuracy vs. Infra Cost:  Balance model complexity with infrastructure costs.  Consider model pruning or simplification techniques.  Process multiple inference requests in a single batch to reduce overhead.  Cache frequently accessed predictions to reduce latency.  Utilize vectorized operations for faster computation.  Dynamically adjust the number of inference service replicas based on demand.  Identify performance bottlenecks using profiling tools.
  
  
  8. Monitoring, Observability & Debugging
 Collect metrics on latency, throughput, error rates, and resource utilization. Visualize metrics and create dashboards for real-time monitoring.  Instrument code for distributed tracing and observability.  Monitor data drift and model performance.  Comprehensive monitoring and alerting platform.Critical metrics:  Inference latency (P90, P95), throughput, prediction accuracy, feature drift, data completeness, and resource utilization. Alert conditions should be defined for anomalies in these metrics. Log traces should provide detailed information about inference requests and errors.
  
  
  9. Security, Policy & Compliance
  Log all access to the BN model and data.  Ensure that BN training and inference are reproducible.Secure Model/Data Access:  Implement access control policies to restrict access to sensitive data and models.  OPA (Open Policy Agent) for policy enforcement, IAM (Identity and Access Management) for access control, Vault for secret management, and ML metadata tracking for lineage and auditability.
  
  
  10. CI/CD & Workflow Integration
GitHub Actions/GitLab CI/Jenkins:  Automate BN training, testing, and deployment.Argo Workflows/Kubeflow Pipelines:  Orchestrate complex ML pipelines, including BN training and deployment.Deployment gates should be implemented to ensure that new BN versions meet predefined quality criteria. Automated tests should verify model accuracy, data validation, and performance. Rollback logic should be in place to revert to a previous stable version in case of failure.
  
  
  11. Common Engineering Pitfalls
Ignoring Conditional Independence Assumptions:  Incorrectly assuming independence between variables can lead to inaccurate inferences.Overfitting the BN Structure:  Learning a complex structure that doesn't generalize well to new data.  Estimating BN parameters with limited data can lead to unreliable predictions.  Failing to account for feedback loops between variables can lead to biased predictions.  Deploying a BN without adequate monitoring can result in undetected failures.Debugging workflows should include examining log traces, visualizing the BN structure, and analyzing feature distributions.
  
  
  12. Best Practices at Scale
Mature ML platforms (Michelangelo, Cortex) emphasize:  Distributed inference, model sharding, and caching.  Multi-tenancy to support multiple teams and applications.Operational Cost Tracking:  Monitoring and optimizing infrastructure costs.  Defining clear stages of maturity for ML systems.Integrating BNs into a robust ML platform requires a focus on automation, observability, and scalability.  The business impact of BNs should be clearly defined and tracked.Bayesian networks are powerful tools for building robust, explainable, and adaptable ML systems. However, successful production deployment requires a systems-level approach, encompassing rigorous MLOps practices, comprehensive monitoring, and proactive risk management.  Next steps include benchmarking BN inference performance against alternative models, integrating automated structure learning into the CI/CD pipeline, and conducting regular security audits.  Investing in these areas will unlock the full potential of Bayesian networks and drive significant business value.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>⚡ Introducing CORE - open source, shareable, user-owned memory graph for LLMs</title><link>https://dev.to/heysolhq/introducing-core-open-source-shareable-user-owned-memory-graph-for-llms-570m</link><author>Manik Aggarwal</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 14:51:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Are you wasting time re-explaining yourself dozens of times a day, just to keep ChatGPT, Cursor, and Claude on the same page?

Hey Devs! 👋****
I’m Ezekiel — you’ll see me around as carixdev — and I’m working on an open project that combines AI, emotion, and education: TutorMind.✨ What is TutorMind?
TutorMind is an emotionally-aware AI tutor that adapts to how students actually feel — not just what they score.Imagine a study companion that:📚 Explains concepts in different ways (text, visuals, or even voice)🤖 Detects when you’re frustrated and shifts tone or adds encouragement🎯 Generates quizzes on the fly based on your weak spotsIt’s not just a static chatbot — I’m trying to create a dynamic AI that reads the learner’s vibe and responds with empathy.🧩 How I’m building it
Right now, I’m experimenting with:Prompt Engineering: Using GPT-4 to generate explanations in multiple formats.Sentiment & Emotion Detection: Testing simple NLP pipelines to analyze student input and adapt the tutor’s tone.LangChain: For chaining different LLM tools — context memory, quiz generation, feedback loops.Voice & Emoji Output: Early tests for audio output and simple UI cues that reflect emotional tone.⚙️ Early Challenges
What I’m figuring out:Keeping context persistent for longer sessions without ballooning token usage.Making “emotion detection” fast and light enough for real-time tutoring.Designing a UX that feels encouraging without being cheesy or robotic.🧠 Why I’m sharing

That indicates that AI coding tools have entered a new phase. They’ve become a significant part of engineering workflows – even at large, enterprise companies.With Dev Twitter obsessed with vibe coding these days, the question many devs we’ve been talking to are asking is what does all this AI use actually look like? Are developers vibe coding whole features for production using agentic coding capabilities? Or are they using AI primarily for tab completion and early prototyping?Ultimately, devs want to know what successful AI adoption really looks like across teams, companies, and industries. What AI tools are teams actually using? How are they getting real value from them? What rules, if any, are companies putting in place around AI usage? Are AI coding tools really boosting productivity or just helping teams code faster, but with more bugs?At CodeRabbit, we talk to hundreds of engineering teams every month about how they're using AI. That gives us early visibility into trends around AI adoption, and in the last few months, we've seen striking similarities in the ways development teams are thinking about AI.Let’s dive into what we’re hearing from customers – and why it’s convinced us 2025 is the year of the AI dev tool tech stack.
  
  
  Everyone has AI pain points now
It likely comes as no surprise that the teams we talk to tell us that one of the major pain points of their AI coding tools is that the productivity and DevEx gains they deliver are inconsistent. With studies finding that AI coding tools can add up to 41% more bugs to your code, these tools have come with new challenges.A couple of weeks ago, Ryo Lu, Cursor’s Head of Design, wrote a thread about the potential downsides of using Cursor to write code. In it, he listed 12 steps to take if you don’t want to end up with AI spaghetti you’ll be cleaning up all week.A tool that requires a 12-step guide for avoiding disastrous spaghetti code might be fine if you’re vibe coding a hobby project or on a team of mostly senior devs who can catch and edit out the spaghetti, but imagine what a junior developer could do to a legacy codebase in a highly regulated Fortune 500 company!In addition to more bugs and issues, we’re also hearing that AI coding tools have created bottlenecks at other points of the development cycle.It goes without saying that if you’re writing more code, you have to review more code, test more code, document more code, and refactor more code. Very quickly, your ‘game-changing’ AI productivity gains get held up at other manual parts of the development cycle. And that work can be harder and more time consuming given AI-generated code’s tendency to have more issues.
  
  
  A new way to code = A new tech stack
That’s why many devs have come to an important realization this year: You can’t just introduce a transformative technology and leave the rest of the software development cycle intact. You need an end-to-end AI dev tool tech stack.It’s common for disruptive technologies to spark broader ecosystem changes. A great example is how GitHub’s 2008 launch resulted in the launch of both Circle CI and Jenkins three years later. AI coding tools seem to be following an even faster timeline.After a few years of using them, engineering leaders have realized that AI coding tools help sometimes but hurt sometimes, too. To actually realize the promised productivity gains, they need additional tools for the downstream tasks they create or make more difficult.But this shift to thinking about AI adoption as a stack is also about using the same approach of leveraging AI to boost productivity that worked for code generation for other manual tasks. Why not review faster and test faster if you’re coding faster? Especially since almost no one loves reviewing code or writing tests?In some cases, the ROI of leveraging AI at other stages of development might even be higher than what AI coding assistants deliver. That’s because those AI tools work to remove bugs from code rather than adding them in.
  
  
  What’s in the AI dev tool tech stack?
The AI dev tool stacks we’re seeing our customers adopt are a layered set of AI tools that support every stage of the software development lifecycle.Here’s a quick look at the layers of that stack, how they fit together, and why you’ll probably be using most of them by the end of this year – if you aren’t already.Foundational: AI coding toolsEssential layer: AI code review toolsOptional layer: AI QA test toolsOptional layer: AI refactoring toolsOptional layer: AI documentation tools
  
  
  Foundational: AI coding tools
This is where most teams start. These tools help developers write code faster – either by suggesting autocompletes of what you’re currently writing or by generating entire functions, tests, or components based on natural language prompts. Over time, they’ve become more sophisticated with deeper codebase awareness, a greater commitment to code quality, and a recent focus on agentic, multi-step tasks. But these tools are still notorious for introducing bugs, vulnerabilities, and performance inefficiencies into code. That translates into developers doing a lot more code editing and reviewing.Increasingly, we’re hearing two things. First, devs aren’t just using one tool but often leveraging multiple tools based on what each tool is best at (a process satirized in this tweet). Second, devs are increasingly opinionated about which tool or tools they want to use – with the choice of an AI coding assistant becoming as divisive as whether to use a PC or a Mac.That’s led many teams to start giving developers a choice around AI assistants rather than choosing just one to buy licenses for. Given that they’re likely to also be more effective at using the tool they prefer, that benefits companies, too.We break these tools into five categories – though many tools span multiple categories.Tab completion tools: GitHub Copilot, Cursor Tab, Windsurf, TabNine, Sourcegraph Cody, Qodo, JetbrainsAI coding assistants: GitHub Copilot, Cursor, , Windsurf, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, Zed, Cody by Sourcegraph, Aider, Qodo, Cline, Roocode, Blackbox, OpenHands, Gemini Code Assist, Augment Code, Amazon Q, JetBrains AI AssistantAgentic coding tools: Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cline, Roocode, Blackbox AI, Continue, Devin, Jules, Augment Code, OpenHandsAI app generator tools: Lovable, v0, Bolt, Builder.io, Figma Make, Fine.dev, StitchCodebase context tools: Repomix, Repo Prompt, Context7
  
  
  Essential layer: AI code review tools
AI code review tools sit at the center of the stack because they directly address the biggest bottleneck introduced by AI coding tools: the review process. If your code is getting written faster — and more often — by machines then you need a better way to review it.Trying to manually review increasingly more code as a team isn’t just a recipe for burnout, it also risks quality degradation. Research shows that most devs can only manually review up to ~400 lines of code before fatigue sets in. That fatigue could mean devs miss more critical bugs then have to address them in production.Indeed, code review tools don’t just help you merge PRs up to 4x faster and reduce the time you spend reviewing by up to 50%. They are also essential in AI-assisted development to keep bugs from production given that AI coding tools have been found to add up to 41% more bugs to code. Using them protects your AI productivity savings by ensuring no bad code ends up in production.AI code reviews also help improve code quality, reduce reviewer fatigue, and standardize best practices across teams no matter which AI coding assistants your team members are using. Unlike code generation and agentic coding tools, their output isn’t wildly inconsistent since it doesn’t depend on the AI competency of any individual developer to know how to prompt them.But, perhaps more importantly, they leverage AI for what it’s best at – automating repetitive and tedious tasks devs don’t want to do. Who wants to spend an hour adding a dozen comments to a PR when AI can add most of those comments for you, give you easy 1-click fixes for each of them, and find bugs you might have missed?These tools come in three main flavors:Features of an AI coding tool: Cursor, GitHub Copilot, JetBrains, Windsurf Forge (deprecated)Git-based AI code review tools: CodeRabbit, Bito, Greptile, Qodo, Graphite DiamondBoth IDE and git-based AI code review tools: CodeRabbit, SonarQube, Qodo, Sourcery
  
  
  Optional layer: AI QA test generation & execution tools
For many dev teams, QA testing has long included some form of AI. But a new generation of AI-powered QA tools promise to automate even more of the grunt work – especially around generating and maintaining tedious end-to-end tests that simulate real user journeys. Instead of manually thinking up every scenario, you can let an AI generate test cases or even entire test scripts from a natural language description of what needs to be checked.The benefits are hard to ignore. The most important is speed – they can churn out or execute suites of tests in a fraction of the time and generate dozens of scenarios at once. However, they also help achieve greater breadth of coverage by running through permutations a human might overlook or not have time for.. Some even offer self-healing capabilities to adjust tests when your UI or data changes, reducing maintenance headaches and keeping your test suite running smoothly as the app evolves.We break these down into two categories:AI test generation tools: Testim, Mabl, Functionalize, testRigor, Autify, ACCELQ, Qodex, TricentisAI test execution and maintenance tools: MuukTest, Applietools, Sauce Labs, Perfecto, Meticulous
  
  
  Optional layer: AI Refactoring tools
While some AI coding tools claim they can be used for refactoring, their results are often lackluster. For that reason, many companies adopt AI tools created explicitly for refactoring code as part of their AI dev tool tech stack after they’ve had bad experiences attempting to use coding tools for that use case.AI-powered refactoring tools promise to automate the tedious and repetitive aspects of improving your codebase from minor optimizations to significant architectural changes. Instead of spending hours manually hunting down inefficiencies or repeating the same structural tweaks across your codebase, these AI tools quickly identify and even execute refactoring opportunities from a simple natural-language description.We divide these tools into two types:Semi-automated tools: CodeGPT, GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, Sourcegraph CodyFully automated tools: Claude Code, Devin, OpenAI Codex
  
  
  Optional layer: AI documentation tools
While docs are never the first thing that teams think about when adopting AI, it’s one task that they appreciate getting help with when they do. These tools tackle one of coding’s most dreaded tasks—writing and updating code documentation like inline comments to docstrings. Instead of manually documenting every new function or combing through outdated guides, devs can let AI tools quickly draft readable, up-to-date documentation directly from the code itself, saving countless hours of tedious work.Code-level docs tools: DeepWiki, Cursor, CodeRabbit, Swimm, GitLoop, GitSummarizeSo, what do some of these AI dev tool tech stacks look like? We’ve seen a range of configurations from company to company but here are some common stacks teams are using.There’s a growing group of companies we encounter who have implemented or are in the process of implementing an end-to-end AI dev tool stack that includes an AI-powered coding tool, code review tool, QA tool, refactor tool, and docs tool.These are typically companies where there’s been significant internal leadership around AI adoption either from the C-Suite or engineering. They were also often early adopters of AI coding tools and have already seen their benefits so are looking for additional AI productivity and DevEx gains.
  
  
  ‘Choose-your-own-AI-tool’ stack
We are increasingly seeing companies that are implementing AI tools throughout the development cycle AND giving their team more choice as to which tools they use. These companies understand (or have learned the hard way) that different AI tools are best suited for different kinds of work and that the best AI tool for any developer is the one they feel most comfortable prompting.This strategy hasn’t just anecdotally helped increase AI adoption but it’s also improved developer satisfaction and experience at these companies. That’s because, increasingly, developers are opinionated about which tool they use. Some companies offer developers choice over just their AI coding tool (Cursor, Copilot, or Claude Code?) while others will offer devs choice over other tools in the stack, as well.
  
  
  ‘Multiple coding tools’ stack
Not to be outdone by the companies that let developers choose their own AI tools are the companies that let devs choose multiple AI coding tools. Maybe they use Lovable for prototyping UI and then Cursor to write the app. Or they use TabNine for code completion and ChatGPT for code generation. More companies are saying yes to developers using more than one tool if they can make the case for why it will improve their productivity.Not all companies that we’re seeing building an AI dev tool stack are adopting all the tools in the stack. Typically, however, their stacks involve an AI coding tool, an AI code review tool, and another AI tool from our list – be that an AI refactoring tool, an AI QA tool, or an AI docs tool. Which they adopt often depends on their codebase, internal expertise, and needs. For example, larger companies are more likely to adopt AI QA tools since they have a large enough team internally to manage QA whereas smaller companies are more likely to mostly outsource QA to contractors and agencies.Finally, we see a lot of companies building just an ‘essential’ stack which includes just an AI coding tool and an AI code review tool to help navigate the added bugs and more complicated code reviews that typically result from using coding assistants. Code review tools also have some of the highest ROI of any AI tools – including AI coding tools – since they both save significant time and keep bugs out of production.
  
  
  Building your own AI dev tool stack: What to consider
When it comes to building an AI dev tool stack, we’ve seen a number of approaches. Many adopted AI coding tools and then iteratively looked for individual solutions to the problems those tools created as downstream issues became particularly painful.Other companies took a more intentional approach with CTOs or other technical leaders investigating tools that could improve the development cycle and running proof-of-concept tests to see whether they actually deliver results. Some even waited to adopt AI coding tools and leveraged AI code review tools to address their existing code review backlogs first.We recommend a proactive approach since we often see teams suffering from delayed milestones and dev burnout before they start looking for solutions.Want more info about what we’ve been seeing around AI adoption of specific tools? We have another post here where we go into greater details about the different types of tools in each category and how we’re seeing them helping engineering teams.We’d love to hear more about how you’re building your AI dev tool stack and what’s working for you.

First, let's understand the basics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML):Artificial Intelligence: Any technique that enables computers to mimic human behavior.
Machine Learning: The ability of a system to learn without being explicitly programmed.
Deep Learning: A subfield of machine learning that extracts patterns from data using neural networks.In deep learning, we teach computers how to learn a task directly from raw data.Why Deep Learning?
Manually engineering features is time-consuming, brittle, and hard to scale. Deep learning answers the question: Can we learn useful features directly from data?Example: How Would You Detect a Face?
Imagine I tell you to build an AI that can detect faces in pictures. How would you even start?First, you'd look for simple things like lines and edges.
Then, you'd detect curves — like the roundness of an eye or cheek.
Next, you'd combine those curves and lines to identify facial parts — eyes, nose, ears.
Finally, you'd assemble all those parts to recognize a full face.
This is how humans intuitively recognize patterns — from small pieces to the bigger picture.Now here’s the powerful part: deep learning does this automatically. You just feed the system enough images, and it learns these steps on its own — layer by layer.So What's the Big Idea?
The main idea of deep learning is this: You don’t need to hand-code every step. Just give the model enough examples, and it will figure out what patterns to look for — from simple lines to full faces.That’s what makes deep learning so powerful.Why Now?
Neural networks have existed for decades. So why is deep learning suddenly everywhere?Because three major things have changed:Data: We now have massive amounts of data from phones, social media, sensors, etc. Deep learning thrives on data.Compute Power: GPUs are now fast, cheap, and widely available, making it possible to train large models efficiently.Open Source Tools: Frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras make it easy to build deep learning models without starting from scratch.So while the ideas are old, today's tools, data, and hardware finally let them shine.Source:course MIT 6.S191 MIT:DeeplearningLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Agent</title><link>https://dev.to/jacobhsu/ai-agent-2ofe</link><author>JacobHsu</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 14:08:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Airtop | Browser Automation for AI Agents

  Part 1: Backend Foundation creating a Ticket raising platform
A practical guide to creating real-world backend systems using Mongoose, Express middleware, and secure authentication.Customer support systems are an essential part of any tech-driven business, and building one from scratch is a great way to learn full-stack development with real-world requirements.In this series, I'm documenting the development of HelpMe, an AI-powered support ticket system built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The goal is to simulate a production-grade ticketing platform with:Role-based access (user, agent, admin)Ticket lifecycle managementModular, scalable backend structureAI features (coming soon)This post will cover the backend foundation — ideal for anyone looking to build a professional-grade project using Express and MongoDB.Organizing files in a clean, modular way is key to scaling your backend efficiently. Here's how the backend is structured:npm init -y
npm install express mongoose dotenv cookie-parser bcryptjs jsonwebtoken

import express from 'express';
import mongoose from 'mongoose';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import cookieParser from 'cookie-parser';

dotenv.config();
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());
app.use(cookieParser());

// Routes (example)
import authRoutes from './routes/auth.js';
app.use('/api/auth', authRoutes);

// Connect to MongoDB
mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI)
  .then(() => app.listen(5000, () => console.log('Server running')))
  .catch(err => console.error('MongoDB connection failed:', err));

User Schema
// models/User.js
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: { type: String, required: true, trim: true, unique: true },
  email:    { type: String, required: true, trim: true, lowercase: true, unique: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true, minlength: 6 },
  role:     { type: String, enum: ['user', 'admin', 'agent'], default: 'user' }
});

export default mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

Ticket Schema
// models/Ticket.js
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

const ticketSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title:       { type: String, required: true },
  description: { type: String },
  priority:    { type: String, enum: ['low', 'medium', 'high'], default: 'low' },
  status:      { type: String, enum: ['open', 'in-progress', 'closed'], default: 'open' },
  createdBy:   { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  assignedTo:  { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', default: null }
});

export default mongoose.model('Ticket', ticketSchema);


  
  
  Why Schema Design Matters
Relationships like createdBy and assignedTo are handled using MongoDB references (ObjectId), enabling efficient population and querying.Enumerations ensure valid values for priority, status, and role, enforcing business rules at the DB level.Auth routes include:
POST /register – Create a user accountPOST /login – Authenticate and store JWT in an HTTP-only cookiePOST /logout – Clear the authentication cookie// routes/auth.js
import express from 'express';
import bcrypt from 'bcryptjs';
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
import User from '../models/User.js';

const router = express.Router();

router.post('/register', async (req, res) => {
  const { username, email, password } = req.body;
  const hashed = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
  const user = new User({ username, email, password: hashed });
  await user.save();
  res.status(201).json({ message: 'Registration successful' });
});

router.post('/login', async (req, res) => {
  const { email, password } = req.body;
  const user = await User.findOne({ email });
  if (!user || !(await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password))) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid credentials' });
  }

  const token = jwt.sign({ id: user._id, role: user.role }, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
  res.cookie('token', token, { httpOnly: true });
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Login successful' });
});

router.post('/logout', (req, res) => {
  res.clearCookie('token');
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Logged out' });
});

export default router;

Middleware: Secure AccessTo protect routes and limit access based on roles, we add two middlewares:// middleware/verifyToken.js
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';

export const verifyToken = (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.cookies.token;
  if (!token) return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized' });

  jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET, (err, decoded) => {
    if (err) return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Invalid token' });
    req.user = decoded;
    next();
  });
};

// middleware/roleMiddleware.js
export const roleMiddleware = (roles) => (req, res, next) => {
  if (!roles.includes(req.user.role)) {
    return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Access denied' });
  }
  next();
};

This system allows you to protect endpoints like:app.get('/tickets/all', verifyToken, roleMiddleware(['admin']), controller);

Buckle up, because I'm about to take you on a wild ride – our journey building  for the Bolt Hackathon. Was it smooth sailing? Absolutely not. Was it epic? You bet your git commit -m "final final final" it was. And yes, there might be some  exaggerations, but I promise, the core truth is always just a semicolon away.
  
  
  🚀 The Spark of Genius (or, How We Avoided Total Brain Drain)
The idea for QuantaCode hit us like a perfectly formatted, lint-free commit: developers spend half their lives wrestling with messy code, debugging nightmares, and trying to figure out if their codebase is more "pristine garden" or "dumpster fire after a coding convention argument." We thought, "What if we could get  in code analysis?" (Okay, maybe the "quantum-level" part was a  exaggeration, but we definitely aimed for deep insights!) We dreamed of an AI that didn't just tell you  was wrong, but , and even talked to you about it. Voice-powered code analysis? Madness! But the good kind of madness. This vision pushed us to explore the bleeding edge of AI integration in developer tooling, aiming for something truly transformative.
  
  
  🎯 What We Cooked Up (Spoiler: It's Pretty Cool)
So, what exactly is this mythical beast, QuantaCode? It's an AI-powered codebase health management platform. Think of it as your code's personal, highly intelligent, and slightly judgmental doctor, always ready to give you a check-up and prescribe improvements.Core Features (The Good Stuff):: We fed OpenAI GPT-4 all the code it could eat, and it spat out insights on quality, security, and maintainability. It's like having a super-senior architect review your entire repo in seconds. (Okay, maybe not , but definitely faster than a human, and without the passive-aggressive comments!) Our AI delves into code patterns, potential anti-patterns, and even documentation gaps to provide a holistic view.: This is where the magic (and a bit of ElevenLabs wizardry) happens. You can literally  to your codebase and get audio summaries. Imagine asking, "Hey QuantaCode, what's the biggest issue in my  module?" and getting a coherent, spoken answer. Free users get a charmingly robotic voice; premium users get a voice so natural, you'll wonder if your code is flirting with you. This feature was designed to make complex analysis accessible and interactive.: Because nobody likes surprises, especially when it's a critical bug lurking in production. QuantaCode keeps a vigilant eye on your repository, alerting you to changes in health metrics as they happen.: We gotta eat, right? Stripe handles the billing, even with fancy promo codes. This allows us to offer advanced features and sustain development.: For us to stalk... I mean,  user behavior and platform performance. This dashboard gives us insights into feature adoption, common issues, and overall system health, enabling continuous improvement.: Because even your phone deserves to see beautiful code analysis. We meticulously crafted the UI to ensure a seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.Our Tech Stack (The Guts & Glory):: Next.js 13, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (the usual suspects, dressed to impress, and chosen for their robust ecosystem and developer experience).: Next.js API Routes, Prisma ORM (our database savior, after some initial wrestling).: PostgreSQL (production-ready!), SQLite (for quick dev cycles, though with some Bolt-specific quirks).: OpenAI GPT-4 (the brains behind the operation), ElevenLabs (the voice of reason, and sometimes, humor).: Stripe (our financial guardian, diligently handling subscriptions).: Netlify (because who has time for complex deploys when you're in a hackathon?).: NextAuth.js (keeping things secure and user sessions managed).
  
  
  🛠️ The Grand Build-Out (or, How Bolt Saved My Sanity... Mostly)
Building QuantaCode was a multi-phase saga, and honestly, Bolt, the AI generator, was my co-pilot for a significant chunk of it. It's like having an incredibly fast, sometimes opinionated, but ultimately indispensable team member.Phase 1: Laying the Foundation
We started with Next.js 13, structuring everything like a perfectly organized closet. Clean, modular, scalable. (Truth: It was probably a messy pile of clothes at first, but we cleaned it up, honest, usually with a quick  and a prayer!) This foundational work was crucial for ensuring the project could grow without collapsing under its own weight.Phase 2: Database & Authentication - The Great Pivot (and Bolt's Preferences)
Oh, Drizzle ORM. You promised so much, but delivered... headaches. Our complex schema for subscriptions and analytics just wasn't playing nice. The real kicker here wasn't Drizzle itself, but that Bolt seemed to have a strong preference for Prisma, making it challenging to get Drizzle to work seamlessly within the Bolt environment. This forced our hand. So, we did what any sane developer does in a hackathon:  It meant rewriting our entire data layer (cue dramatic music), but Prisma's TypeScript integration and robust relationship handling were a godsend. Seriously, Bolt, if you're listening, some native engine support for Prisma, especially allowing for the , would be a game-changer. We also hit a snag with testing: Bolt didn't readily allow us to spin up a local SQLite database for quick testing; we needed an actual PostgreSQL link even for development. This added an unexpected layer of setup complexity.Phase 3: AI Integration - Bolt's Brainpower
This is where Bolt truly shined. Crafting those "quantum-level" prompts for OpenAI GPT-4? That's where Bolt was instrumental. It helped us generate the sophisticated queries that made the AI understand documentation, dependencies, code quality, and security. It was like having a super-fast, tireless prompt engineer on demand, allowing us to iterate on AI analysis capabilities at an incredible pace.Phase 4: Voice Features - Making Code Talk
Integrating ElevenLabs was pure fun. To get started, you basically sign up, navigate to your profile settings, and grab your API key – it’s usually under an "API" or "Developers" tab. Then, you just plug that key into your backend environment variables, and  Your code starts chatting. We built out the tiered system: free users get a charmingly monotone robot, while premium users get voices so smooth, they could read a phone book and make it sound interesting. This feature added a unique layer of accessibility and engagement to our analysis.Phase 5: Payment Integration - The Stripe Tango
Stripe for subscriptions, naturally. This was less "tango" and more "salsa with a blindfold." Setting up webhooks is a delicate dance. You register an endpoint on Stripe, get your webhook secret, and then in your Next.js API route, you verify the signature to ensure the request is legit. (Truth: We spent an embarrassing amount of time debugging why payments weren't updating user statuses. Turns out, a single missing  can ruin your whole day, leading to silent failures and frustrated users. We had to meticulously trace the webhook payload and update our user models.)
  
  
  🎢 Challenges We Faced (The Uncensored Director's Cut)
Every hackathon has its demons, and QuantaCode was no exception. These were the moments that tested our resolve, fueled by caffeine, and occasionally, mild panic.Database Migration Complexity & Bolt's Preferences: Drizzle was like that friend who promises to help you move, then shows up with a single box and an "Oops, my car broke down." We ended up doing most of the heavy lifting ourselves by migrating to Prisma. The core issue wasn't Drizzle's capabilities, but Bolt's compatibility. We also faced hurdles with SWC (Speedy Web Compiler), which, while fast, sometimes threw unexpected errors with certain Next.js 13 features or dependency configurations, forcing us to spend time on workarounds. (Truth: It was a necessary pain that paid off, but better ORM and compiler support from Bolt would have saved precious hours.)Stripe Webhook Reliability: Payments were like ghosts – sometimes they'd appear, sometimes they'd wouldn't. Users would pay, and then... crickets. (Truth: Webhooks are tricky beasts. We learned the hard way about needing robust error handling, comprehensive logging, and multiple user lookup strategies. We even wrote specific debugging scripts like fix-stripe-subscriptions.js to bring order to the chaos, ensuring that even if a webhook failed, we had mechanisms to reconcile user subscription statuses.): Trying to analyze a massive repo felt like asking GitHub for too many favors. It would just shut us down. (Truth: We were hitting rate limits like a drum solo. Our fix involved intelligent request batching, prioritizing key files like  for initial analysis, setting a strict 15-minute analysis timeout to prevent endless loops, and running analysis in the background so users wouldn't get stuck staring at a spinner. We also implemented exponential backoff for retries.)Real-time Analysis Updates: Imagine watching paint dry, but the paint might also disappear if you blink. That was our real-time analysis. (Truth: We needed background processing to keep analysis alive even if users navigated away, coupled with aggressive 5-second polling and slick visual progress indicators. This involved setting up a robust state management system to reflect the analysis progress accurately.): Getting the AI to "understand" the codebase context for voice chat was like teaching a parrot quantum physics. (Truth: It required a sophisticated context system, feeding the AI project metadata, file structure, code snippets, and conversation history to make it sound smart and relevant. This involved careful prompt engineering and managing token limits.): Our analysis times were initially so slow, you could bake a cake while waiting. (Truth: We optimized by limiting file analysis to the 30 most important files, batching GitHub API calls, and adding more robust error handling. This significantly reduced the load and improved response times.): Oh, GSAP. You beautiful, powerful, infuriating beast. Bolt, you're amazing at so many things, but when it came to animations, it felt like we were speaking different languages. (Truth: My experience with GSAP was  poor. It wasn't Bolt's fault directly, as it's a complex library, but prompting for intricate animations proved incredibly frustrating. We faced issues with conflicting timelines, unexpected element behavior in React's lifecycle, and debugging GSAP animations felt like trying to find a needle in a haystack made of JavaScript. We eventually got some cool animations, but it was a battle of wills, often requiring manual tweaking after Bolt's initial output.)The AI Brainrot Chronicles: Let's be honest. When you have an AI generator like Bolt, there's a constant, insidious temptation: "Why read this error message? Just ask Bolt to fix it!" (Truth: I definitely faced a bit of "AI brainrot." The urge to just hand off debugging was strong. But I quickly learned that while Bolt is incredible for generating code and concepts, the human element – logical thinking, understanding the  behind an issue, and meticulously reading documentation – is absolutely non-negotiable. It's a powerful collaboration, but the human still needs to be the conductor, guiding the AI and verifying its output.)
  
  
  🏆 Accomplishments That Made Us Fist-Pump the Air
Despite the rollercoaster, we emerged victorious (and slightly sleep-deprived) with some truly awesome accomplishments:First Voice-Powered Codebase Interaction: We actually made code talk! This innovative feature sets QuantaCode apart and makes code analysis more engaging than ever before.Quantum-Level AI Insights: Thanks to Bolt's prompting prowess and our logical thinking, the AI delivers deep, actionable analysis. We're proud of the sophistication of the insights, moving beyond simple linting to provide genuine value.Real-time Background Processing: Analysis runs in the background, so you can keep coding without interruptions. This was a critical UX improvement that ensures a smooth workflow.Comprehensive Admin Analytics: Because data is power, even for hackathon projects. Our admin dashboard provides a clear overview of platform usage and performance.Sophisticated Subscription Management: Payments actually work! (Mostly!) Implementing a robust Stripe integration with webhooks was a significant technical achievement.Production-Ready Architecture: It's not just a prototype; it's built to scale. We focused on a clean, modular codebase that can handle future growth and features.: Looks good on tiny screens too. Our commitment to responsive design ensures a consistent and pleasant user experience across all devices.
  
  
  📚 What We Learned (The Wisdom Gained)
This hackathon was a masterclass in rapid development and problem-solving, teaching us invaluable lessons that will shape our future projects:: Seriously, pick your ORM wisely. Prisma saved us after Drizzle proved challenging within the Bolt environment. We also learned that Bolt's engine support for Prisma could be improved, specifically regarding the inability to upgrade Prisma to its latest versions, which limited our access to newer features and optimizations.Webhook Reliability is Critical: Treat webhooks like precious, fragile babies. They require meticulous handling, comprehensive logging, and robust retry mechanisms to ensure data consistency.API Rate Limiting Strategy: Be nice to external APIs, or they'll shut you down. Intelligent request batching and strategic prioritization are key to working within API constraints.: Essential for long-running tasks and happy users. It's a fundamental pattern for maintaining a responsive UI during intensive operations.Error Handling is Everything: Assume everything will break, then build for it. Comprehensive error logging, user feedback, and recovery mechanisms are vital for production-ready applications.Animation Library Nuances: GSAP is powerful but has a steep learning curve. Don't underestimate it. We found that our experience with GSAP was quite poor, struggling with prompting for complex animations and debugging the resulting code. This highlights a potential area for improvement in AI-generated animation code.: Bolt is a phenomenal co-pilot, but human logical thinking, detailed documentation, and the willingness to get your hands dirty are still paramount. The AI accelerates development, but human oversight ensures quality and correctness.UI Component Library Selection: While Shadcn UI is great, we learned that sometimes a "softer" UI aesthetic might be a better fit for certain projects. It's all about matching the vibe and user preferences, and exploring alternatives beyond the default.: For future AI projects, training on structured sample code (like https://www.google.com/search?q=dycomps.oimmi.com) and real-world market projects would be invaluable for better AI understanding and output. This would provide more realistic and diverse examples, leading to more robust and accurate code generation and analysis.

AI will do the same.I’ve been reflecting lately on how much the world of Quality Engineering is changing — and honestly, I’m excited.At first, I had second thoughts. Like many in tech, I wondered: Will AI replace QAs and QEs?But the more I explored, the clearer it became — AI is not a rival. It’s a powerful ally.Remember when automation testing first entered the scene? The buzz was intense. People thought manual testers would disappear. But what really happened?Automation simply took care of the repetitive, low-value tasks. It freed up testers to focus on exploratory testing, UX, and strategy. It didn’t replace us — it empowered us.AI is doing the same — just at a whole new level.
  
  
  AI in Quality Engineering Today: From Assistant to Superpower
We’ve started exploring using AI in so many exciting ways:
    • ✅ Code Reviews — AI helps flag issues, bad practices, and even suggests fixes.
    • ✅ Test Coverage Reviews — Identify gaps in coverage and guide testing priorities.
    • ✅ Duplicate Test Detection — Clean up redundancy and keep suites lean.
    • ✅ Test Generation — Generate tests from user stories, specs.Eventually, QEs will not be bogged down with boilerplate automation scripts. Instead, we get to do what we do best — think critically about quality.
  
  
  Embracing the Future — With Excitement
This shift initially scared me — but after exploring, it energizes me. I’m genuinely excited by all the possibilities AI brings to the table for Quality Engineers. 🚀AI is becoming the always-on assistant that lets us focus on:
    • Understanding the product deeply
    • Championing the user experience
    • Assessing risk intelligently
    • Designing robust, creative testsThe future of QE isn’t “AI vs Human”. It’s  — a collaboration where we focus on strategy, and AI takes care of the heavy lifting.As QEs, we’re not being replaced — Let’s embrace AI. Let’s learn it, guide it, and use it to build better, faster, and smarter.I’m already seeing it transform my work — and I can’t wait to see what’s next.✍️  Are you using AI in your QA workflows? I’d love to hear what tools you’re trying or where you’re seeing the most impact! Let’s share and learn together. 👇]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Innovate with Digital apps by top mobile app developers at DXB APPS</title><link>https://dev.to/dxb-apps/innovate-with-digital-apps-by-top-mobile-app-developers-at-dxb-apps-2mmm</link><author>Akhlaq Ahmed</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 13:17:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[At DXB APPS, we don't merely develop mobile apps – our mobile app development company Dubai are your transformation partner in the digital space.

Like many solo founders, I began with an idea, a tight budget, and more stubbornness than resources (Lucky being a student you get a bunch of free resources with the github student account) . Here’s a look at the gritty path of building an AI-powered SaaS product without a team, capital, or much of a safety net.: The payments infrastructure Isn’t Built for Founders third world Countries
My first real hurdle wasn’t code or design it was payments. In most African countries stripe is not supported, well you would ask why did this guy start with stripe whilst there a lot of solutions out there which are supported in Africa, Well the answer was after research and considering the kind of customers that i was targeting, i was concerned that people might not be aware of the payments providers and they might hesitate to pay through them and second it was clear that all the other providers would not pay in the currency my customers would paying in, so then Stripe was an obvious choice, And thus where my journey to uncover other alternatives such as Stripe , Lemon squeezy and Polar started. But Alas, That meant I couldn’t just plug and play payments like most tutorials show. I researched endlessly, used a third-party service to incorporate abroad, verified my identity across borders, and finally, weeks later, got my first payment infrastructure live. It was messy, expensive, and time consuming.But when the first payment notification came in (BTW it came in 3 days after incorporating stripe and weirdly enough it was not even from someone i had shared the platform with, it was just a random person in the world), it was worth it.: Marketing is not an easy fit
When I posted Inov-ai on Product Hunt a popular launching tool for Saas products, I imagined at least a few hundred curious eyes. What I got was... silence. No upvotes, no traction. It was humbling.That failure led me to explore better channels. I learned that niche communities (like certain Reddit subreddits and indie founder communities on X) were way more effective. I got real feedback, improved my landing page copy, and even landed my first customer through organic Reddit posting.: User Feedback is Gold (and a Mess)
Ironically, even while building a feedback tool, I struggled with user feedback. It came in from mostly back and forth whatsApp messages, Reddit, support forms on our site, DMs all scattered. That’s when I realized inov-ai needed a smarter interface. So I built Airi, an AI bot that lets you chat with your feedback. You can ask, "What are users struggling with on onboarding?" and get a direct summary from real user data.: Low Resources Means High Ingenuity
When your server has limited RAM and CPU, (Due to limited resources we are still rocking the T2 micro from AWS upgrading soon) and it sure sometimes crashes randomly under traffic, you don’t throw money at the problem you build a Telegram bot to ping you when it goes down. That's something that i picked in my rounds through Reddit posts, And so i build a bot that now also alerts me to new user signups, when the server starts or when it shuts down unexpectedly. It’s not elegant, but it works, and it proves you don’t need fancy dashboards to stay in control.It helps SaaS product teams turn raw customer feedback into actionable insights by:Automatically organizing and tagging input from surveys and forms. Detecting patterns, sentiment, and key themesLetting you chat with your feedback through Airi to explore what mattersWe recently landed an amazing startup business called ghala, And because we are still in the season of iterating fast and improving the product, we have been receiving a lot of constructive feedback. We also opened up a free trial because we want more early-stage teams to explore the product, And above all we are learning a lot from the marketing experience.

In the era of rapid digital transformation, enterprises are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence to streamline operations, make informed decisions, and improve customer engagement. But AI is not a plug-and-play solution—it requires deep expertise, infrastructure alignment, and continuous optimization. That’s why enterprise AI development services have become indispensable for large organizations looking to gain a competitive edge.
From building intelligent systems tailored to unique workflows to deploying scalable customer-facing bots, these services enable businesses to implement powerful AI strategies efficiently and securely. Whether your company is interested in deploying an ai chatbot, developing a task-specific ai agent, or crafting a full-scale intelligent platform, professional AI development support ensures optimal implementation and ROI.
This article explores the top benefits of using enterprise AI development services and how they are reshaping modern business success.Tailored AI Solutions for Unique Business Needs
No two businesses are alike—and their AI needs shouldn’t be either. Off-the-shelf solutions often fail to address the complexity of enterprise environments. Enterprise AI development services offer a tailored approach, aligning AI solutions with specific operational goals, systems, and industry requirements.
Custom ai development ensures that AI tools work seamlessly with your existing tech stack, understand your data structure, and reflect the intricacies of your business processes. This customization leads to more accurate outputs, better automation, and real value generation.Enhanced Customer Experience with AI Chatbots
Modern customers expect real-time, round-the-clock support. An ai chatbot developed through enterprise services offers a far more advanced experience than traditional chat interfaces.
A custom enterprise ai chatbot:
Responds instantly across platformsOffers personalized interactions using CRM-integrated dataEscalates complex queries to human agents when necessarySupports multilingual and voice-based interfacesThese smart systems improve engagement, reduce wait times, and increase customer satisfaction—while saving operational costs.Intelligent Process Automation with AI Agents
Repetitive, time-consuming tasks often create operational bottlenecks. With AI-driven automation, businesses can delegate such responsibilities to digital systems.
AI agents are intelligent components designed to autonomously perform specific business tasks. From invoice processing and order fulfillment to employee onboarding and system monitoring, these agents drastically improve efficiency.
Benefits of deploying custom ai agents include:
24/7 availability with zero fatigueReduced error rates compared to manual executionReal-time decision-making based on dynamic conditionsCross-departmental coordination without human interventionBy partnering with AI development service providers, companies can ensure these agents are built securely and integrated effectively.Data-Driven Decision Making with Predictive Analytics
Data is one of the most valuable enterprise assets, but it’s meaningless without insights. Enterprise ai development services help organizations unlock actionable intelligence through AI-powered analytics and forecasting models.
These models process large volumes of structured and unstructured data to:
Predict sales trends and customer behaviorIdentify risks before they escalateOptimize inventory and supply chainsEnhance marketing targeting and budgetingImprove financial planning and forecastingWith ai development, enterprises can shift from reactive to proactive strategies—driving smarter and faster decision-making across the board.Seamless Integration into Existing Systems
One of the challenges of deploying AI in large organizations is the complexity of legacy systems and multi-layered software environments. Expert AI service providers ensure smooth integration of AI tools—like enterprise ai chatbot platforms and analytics engines—into enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), human resource management systems (HRMS), and more.
This integration reduces redundancy, maximizes ROI, and ensures that AI becomes an embedded part of day-to-day operations instead of a standalone tool.Scalability for Long-Term Growth
AI solutions are not just for today—they must evolve with your business. Whether you are expanding into new markets, adding new product lines, or scaling teams, AI agent must keep pace.
Custom enterprise ai development services focus on building AI that is modular, scalable, and future-ready. This includes:
Cloud-based deployment for easy scalingModel retraining as more data becomes availableMulti-tenant architecture for enterprise groupsFlexible APIs for integrating with new platformsWith scalable AI infrastructure in place, enterprises are better equipped to grow without outgrowing their AI systems.Improved Operational Efficiency Across Departments
One of the biggest drivers for AI adoption is the opportunity to enhance productivity and reduce operational costs. From finance and HR to logistics and customer service, every department can benefit from tailored AI tools.
Examples include:
AI agents managing routine HR queries and onboardingChatbots assisting customers with shipping and billing questionsAI models forecasting raw material demand for procurement teamsDocument understanding models extracting insights from contractsBy improving efficiency, enterprises can redirect human talent to more strategic and creative roles.Better Risk Management and Compliance
Regulatory compliance, fraud detection, and security monitoring are top priorities in industries like finance, healthcare, and insurance. AI can play a crucial role in reducing risk through constant surveillance and pattern recognition.
AI systems built via enterprise ai development services help with:
Detecting anomalies in financial transactionsMonitoring access to sensitive dataEnsuring that operations align with regulatory requirementsProviding audit trails for transparencyWhen AI is designed with governance and compliance in mind, it becomes a critical ally in managing operational and reputational risk.Access to AI Talent and Innovation
Hiring and retaining AI experts in-house can be both expensive and time-consuming. With enterprise development service providers, companies get access to a global talent pool of AI engineers, data scientists, NLP specialists, and solution architects—without the overhead.
Additionally, these teams bring exposure to the latest trends and tools in ai development, ensuring your organization stays ahead of the curve. From large language models (LLMs) to generative AI, experts integrate the best available technologies tailored to your needs.Continuous Improvement Through AI Lifecycle Management
AI is not a "set it and forget it" solution. It requires monitoring, retraining, tuning, and scaling. With ongoing support from enterprise AI service providers, businesses benefit from continuous improvement.
Monitoring model performance and output accuracyUpdating models based on new dataMaintaining infrastructure and APIsScaling use cases and featuresSuch long-term support ensures that your AI systems don’t degrade in performance over time but improve as your business evolves.Conclusion
The adoption of enterprise ai development services is no longer a luxury—it's a necessity for companies aiming to thrive in a competitive, data-driven world. From building intelligent ai chatbot solutions that elevate customer experience to deploying back-end ai agents that automate complex workflows, custom AI services unlock efficiencies across every layer of the enterprise.
These services not only optimize current operations but also future-proof your business by building a foundation for scalable innovation. Whether you are starting your AI journey or seeking to expand your capabilities, investing in custom ai development aligned with enterprise goals is one of the most strategic decisions you can make today.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>📰 AI-powered Software &apos;Free Document Maker&apos; Built in Bangladesh – Now Global with Chrome Extension</title><link>https://dev.to/freedocumentmaker/ai-powered-software-free-document-maker-built-in-bangladesh-now-global-with-chrome-extension-3a00</link><author>Free Document Maker</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 13:02:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[🇧🇩 A Bangladeshi-built AI tool is helping freelancers and businesses create professional documents — for free, with no signup.🚀 Free Document Maker is a growing AI-based web platform offering 30+ tools for creating and editing documents like:Invoices, CVs, and receiptsQuotations and certificatesPDF, Word, WebP, audio, and moreNo login, no watermark, no fees.🌍 Why It Matters

One of the biggest limitations of traditional support teams is their inability to offer round-the-clock service. AI chatbots ensure uninterrupted assistance, allowing customers to resolve their queries at any time. For enterprises with a global footprint, this is a game changer in maintaining consistent support across time zones.Instant Response Times
Speed is critical in customer service. AI-powered chatbots respond to customer queries in real-time, eliminating long wait times associated with human support teams. This fosters trust and satisfaction among users, ultimately contributing to brand loyalty.Consistent Customer Experience
Unlike human agents who may vary in tone or response quality, AI chatbots provide consistent and accurate responses every time. Enterprise AI chatbot development ensures that every interaction is governed by the brand’s communication standards.Cost-Effective Support
Maintaining a large customer service team is expensive. AI chatbot implementation reduces operational costs by handling repetitive tasks, allowing human agents to focus on complex or emotionally sensitive issues. Companies offering enterprise AI chatbot development service help organizations achieve cost efficiency at scale.Multi-Channel Integration
Modern enterprises need to meet customers where they are—be it on websites, mobile apps, social media platforms, or messaging services. AI chatbots can seamlessly integrate with all major communication channels, providing a unified support experience.Intelligent Routing
AI chatbots are equipped with smart routing capabilities. When a customer’s issue is too complex for automation, the bot can escalate the case to the right human agent, ensuring faster resolution without frustrating the user.Personalized User Interactions
With the help of machine learning and customer data analysis, AI chatbots offer tailored interactions based on past behavior, preferences, and query history. This personalization significantly enhances the customer experience.Scalable Support System
As businesses grow, so does their customer base. Scaling a traditional support team can be slow and expensive. Chatbots offer a scalable solution that can handle an increasing number of queries without additional costs or resources.Data-Driven Insights
AI chatbots gather and analyze vast amounts of customer interaction data. This data can be used to identify pain points, popular queries, and emerging issues—enabling companies to proactively improve their services.Automation of Routine Tasks
Routine requests like password resets, order tracking, and appointment scheduling can be easily automated by AI chatbots. This reduces the workload on support teams and speeds up resolution for customers.Language and Regional Support
Global enterprises often struggle with language barriers. AI chatbots equipped with natural language processing (NLP) can understand and respond in multiple languages, making it easier to support a diverse customer base.Enhanced Security and Compliance
Leading enterprise AI chatbot development service providers build bots that comply with industry regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC 2. These bots offer secure communication, authentication protocols, and proper data handling, reducing risks associated with customer service.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>You Built the Tool.

Another member of the SnackPDF community was sharing a success story about compressing their dissertation for submission. What started as a simple customer support channel had evolved into a thriving community of 500+ engaged users who helped each other, shared tips, and provided invaluable feedback for product development.As a Computer Science student at Edinburgh Napier University, Id initially viewed community building as a nice-to-have rather than a core business strategy. Customer support was necessary, but building a community seemed like extra work that wouldnt directly impact revenue. I couldnt have been more wrong.The community began accidentally when I created a simple Facebook group to handle SnackPDF support requests more efficiently than individual emails. Instead of just asking questions and leaving, users started helping each other, sharing use cases, and discussing document management strategies. The organic engagement revealed an unmet need for connection around shared challenges.This accidental discovery led to a more intentional community building strategy. I realised that SnackPDF users‚students, freelancers, small business owners‚faced similar document management challenges beyond just PDF compression. They needed file organisation systems, workflow optimisation tips, and solutions for various technical problems.The key insight was that community value extended far beyond product support. Members wanted to connect with others facing similar challenges, learn from different approaches, and share their own expertise. The community became a resource for professional development, not just technical troubleshooting.Platform selection proved crucial for community success. Facebook groups worked well for casual discussion and broad reach, but Discord provided better real-time interaction and organisation. LinkedIn groups attracted professional users, while Reddit communities offered niche expertise. Each platform served different community needs and member preferences.Content strategy focused on providing value beyond SnackPDF promotion. I shared general productivity tips, document management best practices, and industry insights that helped members regardless of which tools they used. This value-first approach built trust and positioned me as a helpful resource rather than just a vendor.The university environment provided perfect community building experience. Student groups, study societies, and course forums taught me how online communities naturally develop, what keeps members engaged, and how to facilitate meaningful discussions without being overly promotional.Moderation became essential as the community grew. Clear guidelines about helpful behaviour, spam prevention, and respectful discussion created a positive environment where members felt comfortable sharing and asking questions. The tone I set as founder influenced the entire community culture.User-generated content became the communitys most valuable asset. Members shared their own tips, success stories, and creative use cases that provided more diverse perspectives than I could offer alone. This content also reduced my workload while increasing community value and engagement.The feedback loop between community and product development proved invaluable. Community members identified bugs, requested features, and suggested improvements that guided SnackPDFs development roadmap. This direct connection to user needs resulted in better product decisions and higher customer satisfaction.Seasonal engagement patterns emerged that guided community management strategy. University assignment periods generated increased activity and support requests. Holiday seasons brought different workflow challenges. Understanding these cycles helped me prepare relevant content and support resources.Recognition and gamification elements encouraged ongoing participation without feeling artificial. Highlighting helpful members, celebrating milestones, and acknowledging valuable contributions made people feel appreciated and motivated to continue engaging with the community.Cross-promotion opportunities developed naturally as community members discovered complementary tools and services. Instead of competing for attention, I facilitated connections between members and other helpful resources. This collaborative approach strengthened relationships and positioned me as a connector rather than just a seller.The community became a powerful customer acquisition channel through organic word-of-mouth. Satisfied members naturally invited colleagues and friends who faced similar challenges. These referrals had higher conversion rates and stronger retention than traditional marketing channels.Educational content performed exceptionally well in community settings. Live Q&A sessions, tutorial videos, and step-by-step guides generated high engagement while providing genuine value. Members appreciated learning new skills and techniques beyond just using SnackPDF.Partnership opportunities emerged from community connections. Other tool creators, service providers, and industry experts discovered SnackPDF through community interactions, leading to collaboration opportunities that benefited all members.The most successful community initiatives addressed real member needs rather than business objectives. When I focused on helping people solve problems, business benefits followed naturally. When I prioritised promotion over value, engagement dropped and members became less active.Analytics and feedback helped optimise community management efforts. Understanding which content generated the most engagement, which discussion topics resonated most strongly, and what times members were most active guided strategic decisions about community development.The compound effect of community building became apparent over time. Early members became advocates who attracted new members, created valuable content, and provided peer support that reduced my workload. The community became self-sustaining while continuing to grow.International expansion happened organically as community members from different countries joined and shared their perspectives. This global reach provided insights into different markets and use cases that informed product development and marketing strategies.The most valuable lesson was understanding that communities thrive on genuine relationships and mutual value exchange. Members needed to feel heard, appreciated, and connected to something larger than just a product. Building those relationships required consistent effort and authentic engagement.Crisis management became important when community discussions occasionally became heated or off-topic. Having clear guidelines, consistent enforcement, and respectful communication helped maintain positive community culture even during challenging situations.As I plan RevisePDFs community strategy, Im applying these lessons about authentic relationship building and value creation from the beginning. The goal isnt just customer support‚its creating a space where professionals can connect, learn, and grow together.The journey from accidental Facebook group to thriving 500+ member community taught me that community building is ultimately about serving peoples need for connection and mutual support. When you facilitate genuine relationships and provide real value, business success follows naturally.Join the community that puts members first and see how authentic connections drive both personal and business growth at https://www.snackpdf.com‚where every user is part of a supportive network of professionals facing similar challenges.Im Calum Kerr, a Computer Science student at Edinburgh Napier University building SnackPDF and RevisePDF.

But what if you could skip all that?Recently, I needed to recreate a new database from an old ER diagram in PNG format. Instead of writing everything manually in SQL, I tried something faster — using  inside , along with  to validate and deploy it. It worked surprisingly well. So, AI is not only hyping topic but it helps in certain tasks. Let me show you how to achieve this.Here’s a short demo showing the process:
This video shows how you can go from a simple diagram or screenshot to a working, deployed database using just prompts and AI tools.
  
  
  Why Databases Still Slow Us Down
Many developers want to launch new apps, build MVPs, or add features to an existing product. But they hit friction when it comes to databases.It doesn’t matter which language or framework you’re using — eventually, you’ll need a working data backend. And that’s where time gets lost:Setting up the database and designing a schemaAdjusting the schema as your app changesManually building APIs and ORMsNo clean way to spin up test environments with real dataWorrying about migrations and breaking changes
  
  
  A New Workflow Using AI Tools
"I don’t want to spend hours setting up DB & APIs"One prompt → working backend & API"My data model keeps changing as I test ideas"Schema evolution handled automatically and generate mapping data models"I want to connect my app quickly to my data"Apps can use live APIs with no extra infra."I need a testable environment with live data"Hosted database with built-in seed and test data options"I don’t want to manage migrations or versioning"AI handles that under the hoodAI still is NOT replacing us or software developers, but it is removing friction. You still make the decisions about your schema and relationships. You still write the logic. But you don’t waste time repeating boilerplate steps.Next, I will show you how I converted an existing ER diagram image to a really working database. I believe you can use the same approach with other data formats.
  
  
  Convert an ER Diagram Image into a Working Database Using GibsonAI, GitHub Copilot in VS Code

  
  
  Step 1: Get an ER Diagram
If you already have an ER diagram as a , you're good to go.If not, you can use tools like drawdb.app to find templates for common use cases (like eCommerce, HR systems, or SaaS apps). You can quickly edit the schema, then export it as a PNG, JSON, or raw SQL. For example, let's use this music streaming app database diagram template in the demo.That way, you don’t even need to design the schema from scratch — just adapt an existing one.
  
  
  Step 2: Enable MCP Server in VS Code
This tool turns your prompt into a complete schema, deploys serverless database and gives you a live REST API for managing data.
  
  
  Step 3: Set Up GibsonAI CLI and Log In
uvx  gibson-cli@latest gibson auth login
This logs you into your GibsonAI account so you can start using all CLI features.
  
  
  Step 4: Enable MCP Server in VS Code
To use the GibsonAI MCP server inside your VS Code project, you’ll need to add a configuration script. Create a file called  inside an empty folder. This file defines which GibsonAI MCP server to use for this project.Copy and paste the following content into the  file:
  
  
  Step 5: Describe the diagram in a GitHub Copilot chat prompt
Open your ER diagram (or PNG file) in VS Code in the same VS Code project. Open GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code, switch to Agent mode, and select the LLM model, such as GPT-4.1 or GPT-4o. You should see the available tools from GibsonAI.GitHub Copilot reads the comment and starts calling the relevant GibsonAI MCP server tools.  
  
  
  Step 6: Inspect Your Database Schema in the GibsonAI Dashboard
After the prompt runs successfully, go and inspect your new schema in the GibsonAI dashboard. You’ll see everything laid out — tables, columns, relationships — just like in your diagram, with additional improvement, but now fully working and hosted.From there, you can continue evolving your schema:Prompt more to customize the schema using natural language. Or switch to writing  if you prefer —  let you write and run queries directly in your browser. You’ll also see a live ERD diagram update with every change you make.In this workflow, I went from an  to a live serverless MySQL database — all in just a few minutes.What surprised me is that the AI tool didn’t just create the schema — it also generated fully working  for each model. These APIs include things like request validation and response schemas, so you can start using them immediately.This is really helpful if you want to interact with your database directly from your app, without having to build and manage all the data models yourself.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🚀 Using AI to Design and Generate Landing Pages in Minutes</title><link>https://dev.to/nitin-rachabathuni/using-ai-to-design-and-generate-landing-pages-in-minutes-4hnf</link><author>Nitin Rachabathuni</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 11:08:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In a world where speed is currency and attention spans are razor-thin, the ability to design and launch a high-converting landing page in minutes—not weeks—can be a serious competitive edge.That’s where AI steps in.

An MCP client (like Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, Cursor, Windsurf, and more) connects to the server, and allows an LLM to interact with your service. MCP is quickly becoming the de-facto protocol, and we published the ClickHouse MCP server earlier in the year: mcp-clickhouse.Natural language interfaces are becoming popular across pretty much all domains, including the spaces where we find ClickHouse users. Software engineers, data engineers, analytics engineers, you name it. We're all starting to adopt natural language and agentic interfaces for parts of the job. It's making it easier than ever to work with data, whether you're comfortable with SQL or not. What we're seeing is that LLMs are helping to round out and expand people's skills - software engineers can do more with data, data engineers can do more with software, etc. There's never been a time when a wider audience could work with data.Universally across these users, domains, and interfaces is the expectation of speed and interactivity in the user experience. Users aren't firing off a query on Friday afternoon, grabbing a delicious Bánh mì on the way home, and picking up a report on Monday morning. They're having a collaborative, interactive conversation with an LLM, where responses are delivered in seconds, and there is a real back-and-forth. If we add third-party services into the mix, we can't disrupt the user experience. If a user wants to query their database this way, it needs to handle this kind of responsiveness.That's what makes ClickHouse the ideal database for agentic AI data workflows. ClickHouse is built to be the world's fastest analytical database, where no bits, bytes, or milliseconds are wasted. Even before the LLM and agentic era, ClickHouse aimed to support interactive analytics at scale. We didn't set out to be the best database for agentic AI - sometimes, happy accidents just happen.Popularity aside, it's still early days, and the tools, workflows, and use cases are evolving rapidly. We see a lot of people forgoing the traditional SQL interface and BI tooling, instead using chat interfaces like Claude Desktop or ChatGPT to talk to their data, skipping SQL entirely, and generating insights and visualizations. We also see developers without a traditional data background building user-facing applications that expose data to end users, relying on LLMs not just to generate front-ends, but to structure data and optimise queries for very high concurrency.With ClickHouse also becoming the best choice for observability 2.0, we're seeing SREs and DevOps teams using LLMs to query their traces, metrics, and logs, blending full-text search and analytics without obscure query syntax. And we're imagining what might come next: perhaps we'll see LLMs able to use existing observability data to inform their thinking, perhaps making recommendations for architecture, performance enhancements, or bug fixes based on the data they can access without requiring users to prompt with specific errors or traces.
  
  
  ClickHouse MCP Agent Examples
To make it dead simple to get started, we’ve put together some practical examples showing how to integrate various libraries with the ClickHouse MCP server. 
env = {
    "CLICKHOUSE_HOST": "sql-clickhouse.clickhouse.com",
    "CLICKHOUSE_PORT": "8443",
    "CLICKHOUSE_USER": "demo",
    "CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD": "",
    "CLICKHOUSE_SECURE": "true"
} 
We also use Anthropic models and have provided our API key via the  environment variable.Let’s start with Agno (previously PhiData), a lightweight, high-performance library for building Agents.
async with MCPTools(command="uv run --with mcp-clickhouse --python 3.13 mcp-clickhouse", env=env, timeout_seconds=60) as mcp_tools:
    agent = Agent(
        model=Claude(id="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620"),
        markdown=True, 
        tools = [mcp_tools]
    )
    await agent.aprint_response("What's the most starred project in 2025?", stream=True)
This one has a straightforward API. We initialize  with the command to launch our local MCP Server, and all the tools become available via the  variable. We can then pass the tools into our agent before calling it on the last line.DSPy is a framework from Stanford for programming language models.
server_parameters = StdioServerParameters(
    command="uv",
    args=[
        'run',
        '--with', 'mcp-clickhouse',
        '--python', '3.13',
        'mcp-clickhouse'
    ],
    env=env
)

dspy.configure(lm=dspy.LM("anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514"))

class DataAnalyst(dspy.Signature):
    """You are a data analyst. You'll be asked questions and you need to try to answer them using the tools you have access to. """

    user_request: str = dspy.InputField()
    process_result: str = dspy.OutputField(
        desc=(
            "Answer to the query"
        )
    )

async with stdio_client(server_params) as (read, write):
    async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
        await session.initialize()
        tools = await session.list_tools()

        dspy_tools = []
        for tool in tools.tools:
            dspy_tools.append(dspy.Tool.from_mcp_tool(session, tool))

        print("Tools", dspy_tools)

        react = dspy.ReAct(DataAnalyst, tools=dspy_tools)
        result = await react.acall(user_request="What's the most popular Amazon product category")
        print(result)
This one is more complicated. We similarly initialize our MCP server, but rather than having a single command as a string, we need to split up the command and the arguments. DSPy also requires us to specify a  class for each interaction, where we define input and output fields. We then provide that class when initializing our agent, which is done using the  class.  stands for "reasoning and acting," which asks the LLM to decide whether to call a tool or wrap up the process. If a tool is required, the LLM takes responsibility for deciding which tool to call and providing the appropriate arguments.You’ll notice that we must iterate over our MCP tools and convert them to DSPy ones.LangChain is a framework for building LLM-powered applications.
server_params = StdioServerParameters(
    command="uv", 
    args=[
        "run", 
        "--with", "mcp-clickhouse",
        "--python", "3.13", 
        "mcp-clickhouse"
    ],
    env=env
)
         
async with stdio_client(server_params) as (read, write):
    async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
        await session.initialize()
        tools = await load_mcp_tools(session)
        agent = create_react_agent("anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-0", tools)
        
        handler = UltraCleanStreamHandler()        
        async for chunk in agent.astream_events(
            {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Who's committed the most code to ClickHouse?"}]}, 
            version="v1"
        ):
            handler.handle_chunk(chunk)
            
        print("\n")
LangChain follows a similar approach to DSPy when initializing the MCP Server. Like DSPy, we need to invoke a ReAct function to create the agent, passing in our MCP tools. We (well, Claude!) wrote a custom bit of code () to render the output in a more user-friendly way.LlamaIndex is a data framework for your LLM applications.
mcp_client = BasicMCPClient(
    "uv", 
    args=[
        "run", 
        "--with", "mcp-clickhouse",
        "--python", "3.13", 
        "mcp-clickhouse"
    ],
    env=env
)

mcp_tool_spec = McpToolSpec(
    client=mcp_client,
)

tools = await mcp_tool_spec.to_tool_list_async()

agent_worker = FunctionCallingAgentWorker.from_tools(
    tools=tools, 
    llm=llm, verbose=True, max_function_calls=10
)
agent = AgentRunner(agent_worker)

response = agent.query("What's the most popular repository?")
LlamaIndex follows the familiar approach of initializing the MCP server. We then initialize an agent with our tools and LLM. We found the default  value of 5 was too low and wasn’t enough to answer any questions, so we increased it to 10.PydanticAI is a Python agent framework designed to make it less painful to build production-grade applications with Generative AI.
server = MCPServerStdio(  
    'uv',
    args=[
        'run',
        '--with', 'mcp-clickhouse',
        '--python', '3.13',
        'mcp-clickhouse'
    ],
    env=env
)
agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-0', mcp_servers=[server])

async with agent.run_mcp_servers():
    result = await agent.run("Who's done the most PRs for ClickHouse?")
    print(result.output)
Pydantic has the simplest API. Again, we initialize our MCP server and pass it into the agent. It then runs the server as an asynchronous context manager and we can ask the agent questions inside that block.We’re just getting started with MCP and ClickHouse, and we’d love to hear about what you’re building and your experience using mcp-clickhouse.

My project? Idea-HUB — a platform that lets creators upload, protect, and monetize their ideas, even mint them as NFTs. It’s a place for people like me, who have ideas but little to no resources.Things started rocky — power outages, poor internet, a system that wouldn’t turn on without power. I had to run around just to find a working space, battling time and tech just to push something out.And then… I missed the deadline.It hit hard.
Not because I lost a prize — but because I wanted people to have the opportunity to make good use of what I'm building and because I know it'll help a lot of people.
This project wasn’t just for me. It was for anyone who’s ever had a dream but no infrastructure.
But I realized:Missing a deadline doesn’t kill the vision. Silence does.So I’m releasing the project anyway. Half-baked. Buggy. Unpolished. But real.💡 What is Idea-HUB?
Idea-HUB is a digital platform where creators can:Upload and showcase ideasProtect content using a premium lock/blur systemLet investors message them directlyChoose to mint their ideas as NFTs for added ownershipReceive payments directly through wallet integrationIt’s built to serve the dreamers without resources. The underdogs. The me’s out there (lol).⚠️ It’s not complete… yet
This is still a very early version. You might run into errors, unfinished flows, or design quirks. But I didn’t want to wait for perfection before sharing something that matters.The GitHub repo is public.
If anyone out there resonates with the vision, I’m open to collaboration, contributions, or even just a chat.Whether this becomes a fully free platform, gets backed by a partner, or stays an open-source project—the mission is the same:To make it easier for creators to build, even when they have nothing.Let’s make something that helps people.

  Complete Workflow Overview
Your final workflow will look like this: (with integrated scheduling) →  →  →  → 
  
  
  Step 1: Adding Scrapeless Google Search with Integrated Scheduling
We'll start by adding the Scrapeless Google Search module with built-in scheduling.Create a new scenario in Make.comClick the "" button to add the first moduleSearch for "" in the module librarySelect  and choose  action
  
  
  Configuring Google Search with Scheduling
 by entering your Scrapeless API keyClick "" and follow the connection setup: Enter your target query (e.g., "artificial intelligence news"):  (United States)Click the  on the module to open scheduling: Select "At regular intervals": Set to  (for daily execution) or your preferred interval: Use "Add item" to set specific times/days if needed
  
  
  Step 2: Processing Results with Iterator
The Google Search returns multiple URLs in an array. We'll use Iterator to process each result individually.Add an  module after Google SearchConfigure the Array field to process search resultsArray: {{1.result.organic_results}}This will create a loop that processes each search result separately, allowing better error handling and individual processing.
  
  
  Step 3: Adding Scrapeless WebUnlocker
Now we'll add the WebUnlocker module to scrape content from each URL.Add another  moduleSelect  (WebUnlocker) actionUse the same Scrapeless connectionWebUnlocker Configuration:: Use your existing Scrapeless connection:  (mapped from Iterator output):  (wait for page load): Configure to block unnecessary resources for faster scraping
  
  
  Step 4: AI Processing with Anthropic Claude
Add Claude AI to analyze and summarize the scraped content.Add an  moduleSelect  actionCreate a new connection with your Claude API key: Create connection with your Anthropic API key: Configure to analyze the scraped content: claude-3-sonnet-20240229 / claude-3-opus-20240229 or your preferred model: 1000-4000 depending on your needsExample Prompt copy paste in body:{
  "model": "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
  "max_tokens": 1000,
  "messages": [

      "content": "Analyze this web content and provide a summary in English with key points:\n\nTitle: {{14.title}}\nURL: {{14.link}}\nDescription: {{14.snippet}}\nContent: {{13.content}}\n\nSearch Query: {{1.result.search_information.query_displayed}}"
    }
  ]
}
Don't forget to change number

` by your module number.
  
  
  Step 5: Webhook Integration
Finally, send the processed data to your webhook endpoint.Configure it to send a POST request to your webhook: Your webhook endpoint (Discord, Slack, database, etc.): Content-Type: application/json

{
  "embeds": [
    {
      "title": "{{14.title}}",
      "description": "*{{15.body.content[0].text}}*",
      "url": "{{14.link}}",
      "color": 3447003,
      "footer": {
        "text": "Analysis complete"
      }
    }
  ]
}

Whether you're booking a flight, managing finances, or ordering dinner, your experience is shaped by digital interfaces. Behind those seamless interactions is careful, deliberate design that combines beauty with usability. This is the role of UI/UX design—bringing clarity to complexity, making technology feel human.As users demand faster, smarter, and more intuitive interactions, businesses are racing to differentiate themselves through digital experience. An elegant design may catch attention, but a thoughtful user experience creates loyalty. That’s why user-centered design is now at the heart of digital transformation strategies across industries.UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) are two sides of the same coin: focuses on the look and feel—the buttons, color schemes, typography, layout, and visual hierarchy. focuses on functionality—how easy it is for users to complete tasks, how intuitive a product is, and how it makes them feel throughout the journey.While UI is about the surface, UX digs into the experience beneath it. Together, they make or break a product's usability and impact.
  
  
  The Power of Thoughtful Design
Users are more discerning than ever. A confusing app interface, a slow checkout process, or a hard-to-navigate website can drive them away in seconds. But when design is well-executed, it builds trust, improves satisfaction, and turns casual users into loyal advocates.That’s where a specialized UI UX design agency comes into play. These agencies don’t just focus on visuals; they go deeper—conducting user research, mapping user journeys, prototyping interactions, and testing every click and tap. Their goal? To ensure that every product not only looks good but performs brilliantly under real-world conditions.A good UI UX design agency brings a combination of creative direction and strategic thinking. They work closely with product owners, developers, marketers, and stakeholders to translate business goals into functional, user-friendly digital experiences. Whether it’s a startup launching its first app or an enterprise rethinking its customer platform, these agencies provide the roadmap and the expertise to bring ideas to life.
  
  
  Key Benefits of Working with a UI/UX Agency
1. User-Centered Strategy
Design starts with the user. Agencies conduct in-depth research—through interviews, analytics, and competitive audits—to understand user behaviors and needs. This insight forms the foundation of every design decision, resulting in products that resonate.
With tried-and-tested workflows, a UI/UX agency can rapidly prototype and iterate on ideas. Their experience working across different platforms and industries allows them to avoid common pitfalls and deliver high-quality designs efficiently.3. Design Systems for Scale
As products grow, design consistency becomes a challenge. Agencies build reusable design systems—collections of UI components, style guides, and UX principles—that ensure scalability and maintain brand cohesion across all touchpoints.4. Testing and Optimization
Good design is never final. Agencies conduct usability testing and gather feedback to refine products post-launch. This continuous loop of testing and iteration ensures long-term user satisfaction.
  
  
  How UI/UX Is Changing Industries
 Clear navigation and fast checkout increase conversion rates and reduce cart abandonment. Simple dashboards and mobile-first design build trust and help users manage their money with confidence. Intuitive patient portals and appointment systems reduce administrative load and improve health outcomes. Engaging and accessible interfaces support remote learning and digital classrooms.In each case, the work of a skilled UI UX design agency has a direct impact on customer engagement, retention, and brand perception. The digital experience is no longer just part of the business—it is the business.
  
  
  The Process: From Vision to Execution
 Stakeholder interviews, user research, and competitor analysis. Defining personas, mapping journeys, and outlining product goals. Sketching ideas and building low-fidelity prototypes to validate direction.  Applying brand elements, typography, and color to create high-fidelity mockups. Interactive prototypes allow real user testing and feedback loops before development. Finalized design assets and specs are handed off to developers with ongoing support. AI-Driven Personalization: Interfaces that adapt based on user data and preferences.Voice and Gesture Interfaces: Beyond clicks and taps—designing for spoken commands and physical interaction.Accessibility by Default: Designing inclusive experiences for all users, including those with disabilities. Stripping away the unnecessary to deliver faster, cleaner, more focused digital journeys.Designers are no longer just visual artists; they are architects of the future.
  
  
  Choosing the Right Agency
With so many options, how do you choose the right partner? Look for:A solid portfolio with measurable impactDeep understanding of both UX strategy and UI executionClear communication and transparent processesFamiliarity with your industry or type of productTools like Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch, plus prototyping experienceAn ideal partner will feel like an extension of your own team—collaborative, creative, and always user-first.In a digital age, your product’s design is your brand’s voice. A great experience is no longer a bonus—it’s an expectation. Investing in a strong design foundation helps you build trust, increase engagement, and grow with confidence.Working with a forward-thinking UI UX design agency is not just about making your product look good—it’s about creating something people want to use, enjoy using, and keep using. Because in the end, every screen, every scroll, and every click is a chance to make an impression.The future of business is digital. And the future of digital is designed—one interface at a time.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>7 Critical Mistakes Students Make While Learning Artificial Intelligence</title><link>https://dev.to/nadeem_zia_257af7e986ffc6/7-critical-mistakes-students-make-while-learning-artificial-intelligence-34on</link><author>nadeem zia</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 10:12:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence is more than just a buzzword, it's the future of technology.

The subject is complex, constantly evolving, and requires a blend of programming, mathematics, and logical thinking. Through experience and observation, here are seven critical mistakes that most students make while learning artificial intelligence, and how to avoid them for a successful learning journey.What Is Artificial Intelligence and Why Is It Important?Artificial Intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and solve problems. It powers applications like speech recognition, facial detection, recommendation engines, and even fraud prevention systems. AI is not just about code, it’s about decision-making, prediction, and automation at scale.Organizations today are leveraging AI to enhance operations, improve customer experiences, and gain competitive advantage. That’s why trained professionals with real-world AI skills are in high demand across every sector.7 Critical Mistakes Students Must Avoid in AI Learning1. Skipping the Fundamentals of Math and StatisticsAI is built on strong foundations in linear algebra, probability, calculus, and statistics. One of the biggest mistakes students make is ignoring these basics. Without understanding concepts like gradient descent, matrix operations, or probability distributions, building and optimizing models becomes guesswork.2. Learning Too Many Tools at OnceFrom TensorFlow and PyTorch to Scikit-learn and Keras, AI offers a wide variety of frameworks. New learners often jump between tools without mastering any. The better approach is to pick one, understand how it works under the hood, and apply it across various projects before moving on.3. Treating Machine Learning as Black Box MagicA common mistake is running algorithms without understanding how they work. AI is not about feeding data into a model and hoping it works. You need to know what the model is doing - how it learns, what features it’s prioritizing, and how to evaluate its performance.4. Ignoring Data Quality and PreprocessingAI models are only as good as the data they are trained on. Students often ignore cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering steps, jumping straight to modeling. This can result in poor predictions and misleading results. Data understanding is as important as model building.5. Not Practicing on Real-World DatasetsMany learners stick to textbook datasets like Iris or Titanic. While good for basics, they don’t expose you to real challenges like missing values, data imbalance, or noisy inputs. Work on real-world problems, sentiment analysis, fraud detection, or image classification, to build job-ready skills.6. Avoiding Collaboration and Open Source ContributionsAI is a community-driven field. Students who learn in isolation often miss out on important insights, trends, and peer feedback. Participate in hackathons, contribute to GitHub repositories, and join online communities to improve faster and stay updated with advancements.7. Studying Without a Clear Goal or Domain FocusAI is vast. From NLP and computer vision to robotics and generative models, there are endless specializations. Without a goal, students end up learning in random directions. Choose a domain that excites you, whether it's healthcare, finance, or automation, and build focused projects around it.What You Will Learn in an AI CourseA structured AI program will guide you through both the theoretical and practical aspects of artificial intelligence.

These challenges are particularly common in BPO services. That’s where Robotic Process Automation (RPA) becomes a smart solution. RPA makes use of software robots to manage rule-based processes without human intervention.A high percentage of companies are moving to RPA to enhance speed, accuracy, and cost efficiency. RPA in BPO enables service providers to scale quickly and affordably, where deadlines and precision are paramount. In this blog, we will guide you through Robotic Process Automation, how it works, and why it's transforming the way BPO companies function.What is Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
Robotic Process Automation is termed as software technology that employs ‘bots’ to perform human actions on digital systems. These bots have the potential to perform repetitive, rule-based tasks just like humans, but quickly, continuously, and without errors. These bots can log in to apps, move files, enter data, and complete tasks that follow clear rules. Different from conventional automation, RPA doesn’t require changes to the prevailing software. It operates across multiple platforms, making it flexible and easy to deploy.For example, an RPA bot can abstract data from emails and enter it into CRM. The software system can also produce invoices or validate data in seconds, and can work continuously without breaks or errors. RPA systems can also work with complex systems, which makes it different from scripts or macros. RPA technology is scalable, secure, and supports business automation in various industries. Also, it offers a comprehensive audit trail for compliance.Repetitive tasks consume a lot of time and resources in Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) services. The BPO tasks usually consist of form filing, payroll entries, or responding to routine emails. Integrating RPA helps automate these processes, so teams can concentrate on more complicated and valuable work.Many BPO companies use RPA to support services such as:
• Data entry and form processing
• Payroll and benefits administration
• Background checks and compliance reporting
• CRM data updates and backend supportInstead of replacing humans, RPA works alongside them. Bots handle structured tasks while humans solve issues, interact with clients, and make decisions. This combination improves turnaround times and service quality.Key Benefits of RPA in BPO Companies
· Increased Efficiency and Productivity
Bots are capable of completing tasks faster than humans. Also, they don’t require breaks or supervision. RPA mitigates delays and ensures consistent output. This results in quicker client delivery and better use of human talent. · Improved Accuracy and Reduced Errors
Manual processes often lead to mistakes. RPA eliminates that risk by following set rules. This leads to higher data accuracy and fewer corrections. This is significant for industries like healthcare, finance, and insurance.· Cost Optimization
Businesses can reduce their dependency on large teams when they automate routine tasks. Although there is an initial setup expense, the long-term savings are substantial. By automating the routine tasks, companies can assign their employees to high-priority tasks and mitigate overheads.· Scalability and Flexibility
RPA tools scale easily. During peak periods, you can deploy more bots without hiring extra staff. You can also introduce bots to new clients or services with minimal delay.· Enhanced Compliance and Reporting
RPA systems create digital logs of every action they perform. This helps companies stay audit-ready and meet compliance standards. They can also schedule automatic reports for better transparency.RPA in BPO: What Firms Should Know?
For RPA to work well, BPO providers need a solid plan. Here's how to start:Find Tasks that can be Automated: Seek tasks that are based on rules, repetitive, and high-volume.
Calculate Possible ROI: Measure the time saved, cost mitigated, and error rates lowered.
Select the Right RPA Tools and Vendors: There are many choices such as UiPath, Blue Prism, and Automation Anywhere.
Start With a Pilot: Test the bot in a small process. Monitor its performance.
Scale Gradually: Once the pilot succeeds, expand automation to other areas.
Overcoming Common Challenges
RPA adoption may face hurdles like:Staff resistance to change
Integration issues with legacy systems
Maintenance and updates of bots
Regular training and involving employees early can reduce pushback. Choosing scalable tools and having a support team also help smooth the journey.
RPA is evolving. Businesses are combining RPA with AI and machine learning for intelligent automation. These systems not only follow rules but also learn from data. This opens doors to more advanced BPO automation. Hybrid workforces, where bots and humans work together, are becoming common. BPO firms using automation as a foundation are attracting global clients looking for value and agility. To stay competitive, BPO teams need to learn new skills. Understanding RPA tools and managing bots will become key roles. Upskilling workers in bot monitoring, data analysis, and compliance will strengthen BPO operations.
Robotic process automation is more than just a tech upgrade. It helps BPO firms deliver better, faster, and more reliable services. RPA in BPO boosts productivity, reduces costs, and improves client experience. Companies that use business process automation smartly can handle more clients without scaling up teams. RPA technology allows BPO firms to meet service targets while staying flexible and secure.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Unlock Business Potential with Machine Learning by Chirpn</title><link>https://dev.to/chirpn/unlock-business-potential-with-machine-learning-by-chirpn-cm0</link><author>chirpn</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 09:53:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Looking to transform your business with intelligent, data-driven decisions?

It’s not flashy, and it’s not the kind of change that makes headlines every day. But it’s real, and it’s reshaping the way companies work from the inside out.And no, it’s not just tech companies playing with shiny new tools. Retail, insurance, healthcare, finance—everyone’s quietly experimenting, optimizing, and rethinking the way work gets done. The result? More efficient operations, happier teams, and faster growth.
  
  
  Forget the Hype—Here’s What’s Really Happening
Let’s start with this: most businesses are tired of hearing about “the next big thing.” The truth is, companies aren’t looking for another trend. They’re looking for solutions—tools that help teams save time, improve accuracy, and make better decisions. That’s where Gen AI quietly slips in.What used to take a dozen spreadsheets and hours of human input now takes a few minutes with the right AI-powered system. Natural language queries are replacing complex dashboards. Routine tasks like customer support summaries, internal reports, and even policy drafts? They’re being handled by AI that actually understands context.
  
  
  But Gen AI Alone Isn’t the Whole Picture
Let’s be honest—dropping AI into a broken system won’t fix anything. And that’s exactly why digital transformation services matter more than ever.Companies that are winning right now aren’t just plugging in AI. They’re redesigning their processes from the ground up. They’re asking big questions:Why are we still using three different tools for this?What would it look like if we automated that step?Could we connect systems so teams don’t waste time chasing information?It’s not always glamorous work. Sometimes it’s tedious. But when done right, digital transformation lays the foundation for real AI integration. It ensures the data is clean, the processes are streamlined, and the outcomes are measurable.
  
  
  Real-World Example? Here’s One
A mid-sized insurance company used to take 10–15 days to process a typical claim. Why? Because it involved manual data entry, back-and-forth emails, and lots of human review. Today, with a smart combination of digital transformation and Gen AI, they do it in two days.Documents are scanned and interpreted using natural language models. Logic flows are built into the software, so each claim is evaluated consistently. Alerts are triggered when something looks off. Human oversight is still there, but only where it really matters.That’s not a pipe dream. That’s happening right now.

Startups that delay implementing artificial intelligence developer’s in their processes are left observing competitors who get a head start using intelligent products, optimized processes, and more in-depth understanding of customers. This is the harsh truth that makes it a priority for startups to hire an artificial intelligence developer as one of their very first strategic moves.Market Imperatives Spur Urgent HiringToday's customers want smart, personalized encounters with each digital interaction. Whether an online retailer's recommendation engine, a customer service chatbot, or predictive analytics solution, AI today is table stakes and not an extra premium feature. Startups are aware that without an artificial intelligence engineer as part of the team, they're developing solutions of yesteryear for tomorrow's marketplace.
 The window of competitive advantage diminishes as more and more AI technologies become commodity products. Having access to tools is not a guarantee of success, however. An experienced artificial intelligence software developer has the know-how and skills to select the optimal technologies, avoid pitfalls, and build solutions that really provide business value and not just impressive demos.Investor Expectations and Funding Success
Investors now go out of their way to invest in startups that possess AI components embedded in business models or growth plans. Venture capitalists understand that artificial intelligence can significantly enhance unit economics, reduce operating costs, and create scalable competitive moats. Startups with an artificial intelligence developer as a part of the founding team are generally best-positioned when negotiating capital.
 The presence of this AI talent indicates that the startup understands advanced technology and has the ability to translate data-driven growth strategy into practice. Technical credibility is particularly valuable in trying to match up against other startups operating within similar markets for capital investment.Solving Complex Problems at Scale
Startups also have issues that conventional methods of software development are not able to handle economically. Customer segmentation, price optimization, fraud detection, and content personalization all benefit immensely from AI methods. An artificial intelligence developer can create solutions that learn to improve by themselves as the startup expands, instead of needing constant human tweaking.
 These clever solutions will typically give startups features reserved for only much bigger enterprises. A tiny Internet store, for instance, can utilize best-of-breed recommendation engines up to the level of big-box retailers thanks to the ingenuity of a brilliant AI programmer who understands how to leverage existing ML libraries and pre-trained models.
 Successful startups make decisions based on facts rather than gut feeling. An AI developer helps decide on data collection protocols, analysis designs, and prediction models that provide actionable real-time intelligence from business development outset. Data-driven approaches allow startups to avoid costly mistakes and uncover growth opportunities early.
 The ability to make strong inferences from small sets of data is particularly useful in early-stage companies. An experienced artificial intelligence engineer knows how to make something out of small sets of data, make use of transfer learning techniques, and construct models that will be valuable even when the company has not amassed ginormous sets of historic data.
In tech sectors, sustainable competitive advantages are likely to have a basis in technological capabilities that are hard for others to replicate. A startup recruits an AI engineer to craft these tech moats through patented algorithms, customized data processing pipelines, and improving learning systems.
 These technological attributes become more crucial as markets mature and parity is less difficult to achieve. Startups that possess sophisticated AI capabilities can maintain competitive edges even when larger companies bring more resources into their markets.Attracting Top-Tier Talent
Having an AI engineer on the team makes startups more attractive to other best technical talent. Great engineers want to work on difficult, innovative problems rather than creating run-of-the-mill apps. Having AI projects under their belt makes the startup offer opportunities for technical development and innovation at scale.
 This talent pull is not restricted to engineers. Product managers, designers, and business development professionals more and more want to work with AI-enabled products and data-driven companies. An artificial intelligence developer is helping create the technology infrastructure behind these cross-functional partnerships.Getting Ready for Sudden Death or Quick Scale
Successful start-ups will experience explosive growth that strains traditional systems and processes. AI-driven solutions developed by an experienced artificial intelligence developer are capable of better addressing this growth challenge than rivals that are controlled manually. Customer service, intelligent resource allocation, and forecasted capacity planning become necessities when growth is occurring in a competitive manner.
 The idea to develop scalable artificial intelligence systems from the outset sidesteps technical debt and operational constraints that typically hold high-speed startups back. Such preparedness enables founders to focus on key decisions rather than firefighting operations.
 Recruiting artificial intelligence developer’s  as a requirement is a sign that AI has moved from experimental technology to business imperative, where early adoption is a factor in the success of startups.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>FreeRTOS Design Routine Based on i.MX9352 Development Board M Core</title><link>https://dev.to/ronnie_r_152dc2151d9449c6/freertos-design-routine-based-on-imx9352-development-board-m-core-4d78</link><author>ronnie R</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 09:00:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the embedded systems, the application of embedded real-time operating systems (RTOS) is becoming increasingly widespread. Using an RTOS can utilize CPU resources more reasonably and efficiently. As a lightweight and mature real-time operating system kernel, FreeRTOS has complete core functions, including task management, time management (such as delays and timers), synchronization mechanisms (semaphores, mutexes), inter-process communication (message queues), and so on. These features enable it to meet the needs of small and medium-sized embedded systems with relatively limited resources.i.MX 9352 is a new generation of lightweight edge AI processor launched by NXP, which integrates 2 x Cortex-A55 cores and 1 x Cortex-M33 real-time core. Its architecture design fully reflects the balance between real-time and complex task processing capabilities. To help developers fully leverage the real-time capabilities of the i.MX 9352 M33 core, the FreeRTOS examples provided in the accompanying M-core SDK package are divided into two categories. One category introduces the features of FreeRTOS system components, such as semaphores, mutexes, and queues. The other category shows how to use peripheral interfaces in FreeRTOS. Examples from each of these two categories are selected for demonstration.▊ Demo platform: Forlinx Embedded OK-MX9352-C Development Board
Forlinx Embedded OK-MX9352-C Development BoardFreeRTOS-generic
The sample code of FreeRTOS features supported by the Forlinx Embedded OK-MX9352-C is as follows:freertos_event: Demonstration Routine for Task Event
freertos_queue: Demonstration routine for implementing inter-task communication using queue messages
freertos_mutex: Routine for using mutexes
freertos_swtimer: Usage of software timers and their callbacks.
freertos_tickless: Routine for delayed wake-up using LPTMR or wake-up by hardware interrupt.
freertos_generic: Demonstration routine for the combined use of tasks, queues, software timers, tick hooks, and semaphores.
Since the FreeRTOS_generic routine uses many FreeRTOS features, let's focus on analyzing this routine.(1)Software implementation
The content of the example program includes: task creation, queues, software timers, system tick clocks, semaphores, and exception handling. Specifically:The main function creates three tasks: a queue sending task, a queue receiving task, and a semaphore task.// Create the queue receiving task
if (xTaskCreate(prvQueueReceiveTask, "Rx", configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE + 166, NULL, mainQUEUE_RECEIVE_TASK_PRIORITY, NULL) != pdPASS)
// Create the queue sending task
if (xTaskCreate(prvQueueSendTask, "TX", configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE + 166, NULL, mainQUEUE_SEND_TASK_PRIORITY, NULL) != pdPASS)
// Create the semaphore task
if (xTaskCreate(prvEventSemaphoreTask, "Sem", configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE + 166, NULL, mainEVENT_SEMAPHORE_TASK_PRIORITY, NULL) != pdPASS)The queue sending task blocks for 200ms and then sends data to the queue. The queue receiving task blocks to read from the queue. If the data is read correctly, it prints the current number of received items in the queue.// The queue sending task blocks for 200ms and then sends data to the queue 
static void prvQueueSendTask(void *pvParameters)
    TickType_t xNextWakeTime;
    const uint32_t ulValueToSend = 100UL;
    xNextWakeTime = xTaskGetTickCount();
        // The task blocks until the 200ms delay ends.
        vTaskDelayUntil(&xNextWakeTime, mainQUEUE_SEND_PERIOD_MS);
        // Send data to the queue. A blocking time of 0 means it will return immediately when the queue is full.

① Compile the program: Manually load the M-core program in U-Boot.② Queue: Every 200 milliseconds, the sending task of the queue sends data, and the receiving task of the queue retrieves data. The receiving task transitions from the blocked state to the running state and prints the count.③ Software timer: Every 1s, when the time is up, the callback function is called, and the count is printed.④ Semaphore: Every 5ms, the system clock tick interrupt calls a function. After more than 500 times, the semaphore is released. The semaphore task acquires the semaphore, changes from the blocked state to the running state, and prints the count.Experimental Phenomenon PartFreeRTOS-Peripherals
The Forlinx Embedded OK-MX9352-C development board supports using FreeRTOS to drive various peripherals. The following are some example codes:freertos_uart: FreeRTOS UART demonstration routine
freertos_lpi2c_b2b: FreeRTOS I2C demonstration routine
freertos_lpspi_b2b: FreeRTOS SPI demonstration routine
Since the freertos_uart routine uses typical FreeRTOS features, focus on analyzing this routine.(1) Software implementation
The example program content includes: serial port initialization task, serial port sending task, and serial port receiving task. Specifically:Serial port initialization task:It mainly includes the initialization of serial port peripherals, sending and receiving mutexes, and sending and receiving event groups. The initialization of serial port peripherals has been demonstrated in the bare-metal running serial port example, so it will not be detailed here.// Create a serial port sending mutex.
handle->txSemaphore = xSemaphoreCreateMutex();
// Create a serial port receiving mutex.
handle->rxSemaphore = xSemaphoreCreateMutex(); 
// Create a flag group sending events
handle->txEvent     = xEventGroupCreate();
// Create a flag group receiving events
handle->rxEvent     = xEventGroupCreate();The semaphore is obtained before sending, the sending process is started, and the sending completion event flag is set in the interrupt. After acquiring the event, the send task releases the send semaphore.//1 Get the send semaphore
if (pdFALSE == xSemaphoreTake(handle->txSemaphore, 0))

// 4 Transmission completed, release the transmission semaphore.
if (pdFALSE == xSemaphoreGive(handle->txSemaphore)) // Release the transmission semaphore.
Serial port receiving:Before receiving, obtain the semaphore, call the serial port receiving function, and set the event flag in the interrupt. After the receiving task obtains the event, release the receiving semaphore.// 1. Obtain the receiving semaphore.

The real challenge lies in writing code that performs efficiently and scales well. This is where understanding space and time complexity becomes essential.This article aims to explain the core ideas behind these concepts, what they are, why they matter, and how to reason about them using Big O notation.Runtime refers to the actual time it takes for a program or algorithm to complete a task. However, when analyzing algorithms, we are more interested in time complexity, which expresses how the runtime grows in relation to the size of the input.Time complexity helps us reason about performance regardless of specific hardware or system load. It tells us how well an algorithm will scale and is typically expressed using Big O notation.
  
  
  Common Types of Time Complexity
Below are the most widely encountered time complexities, each with practical implications in software engineering:An algorithm runs in constant time if its execution time remains the same regardless of the input size. Given an array of integers, retrieve the first element. Best for operations that don't depend on the size of the input, often seen in hash table lookups and array index access.Here, runtime grows proportionally with the input size. If the input doubles, the time taken roughly doubles as well. Find the maximum value in an array. Common in straightforward algorithms like searching an unsorted list or basic summations.
  
  
  3. Quadratic Time – O(n²)
Algorithms with quadratic time complexity involve nested iterations over the input data. As the input grows, performance deteriorates quickly. Find all duplicate pairs in an array (naive approach). Common in algorithms like bubble sort or when examining all pairwise combinations.
  
  
  4. Logarithmic Time – O(log n)
In logarithmic time, the runtime grows slowly even as the input size increases significantly. These algorithms often reduce the problem size with each step. Given a sorted array and a target value, find the index of the target. Return -1 if not found. Ideal for operations that repeatedly divide a problem in half.
  
  
  5. Comparing Different Complexities
Let's see all complexities side by side with the same input size:
  
  
  What Is Space Complexity?
While time complexity measures how long an algorithm takes, space complexity measures how much additional memory it requires as the input grows.Independent of input sizeHashMap lookup, array accessBinary search, balanced treesFinding max, counting itemsBubble sort, finding all pairs
  
  
  Visualizing Growth with Actual Timings
Don't Optimize Prematurely: Focus on writing clear, correct code first. Use timing measurements to identify actual bottlenecks. Sometimes you can trade space for time. Caching results uses more memory but can dramatically reduce computation time.Know Your Data Structures: Different structures have different complexity characteristics:* Array access: O(1)

* Array search: O(n)

* HashMap lookup: O(1) average

* Tree operations: O(log n) when balanced
Measure Real Performance: Big O describes growth trends, not actual speed. Always profile your specific use case.Understanding time and space complexity is crucial for writing efficient, scalable software. By measuring actual performance and recognizing complexity patterns, you can make informed decisions about algorithm choice. Start by timing your code, identify bottlenecks, and apply these concepts to write better, faster programs.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[Boost]</title><link>https://dev.to/sathwik_r_6a53fc8b7812087/-1n10</link><author>Sathwik R</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 08:59:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Stuck Translating Ideas to Code?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Stuck Translating Ideas to Code?</title><link>https://dev.to/sathwik_r_6a53fc8b7812087/stuck-translating-ideas-to-code-5di</link><author>Sathwik R</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 08:58:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ever started coding something not because the market needed it…

Being “AI-powered” is no longer enough. SeaOS reimagines the very structure of blockchain intelligence — from the ground up.
As the Web3 space increasingly intersects with artificial intelligence, the rise of so-called “AI on-chain” applications has become one of the industry’s most prominent trends. From AI-enhanced smart contracts to model-integrated DApps, the ecosystem is rapidly experimenting with ways to make blockchains “intelligent.”
But amid the hype, a fundamental misunderstanding persists:
Plugging an AI model into a smart contract does not make a blockchain intelligent.
In most cases, this approach amounts to little more than attaching a black-box inference API to a static contract — a surface-level enhancement that fails to address the deeper integration challenges between AI and decentralized systems.
At SeaOS, we believe true AI-native design means reconstructing the foundational architecture of on-chain intelligence. As an operating system purpose-built for AI-native Web3, SeaOS introduces a radically new paradigm: one where autonomous agents, not static contracts, serve as the core units of execution, coordination, and evolution on-chain.The Legacy Approach: AI as an Add-On, Not Infrastructure
Most current “AI + blockchain” solutions follow a familiar pattern:A pre-trained AI model is hosted off-chain.A smart contract calls the model via an API or oracle.The AI outputs are fed back into the chain for settlement or storage.
While functional, this model introduces significant limitations:Smart contracts remain static. They cannot learn, adapt, or evolve over time.AI logic remains off-chain. The model lives outside the decentralized network, with limited transparency or coordination.Semantic gaps persist. The integration is superficial—contracts and models speak different languages, with minimal real-time feedback or shared state.
The result? Most so-called AI applications are merely "model + chain" hybrids, not truly AI-native systems.SeaOS’s Breakthrough: Architecting Native On-Chain Intelligence
SeaOS’s architecture doesn’t just embed AI into existing systems — it transforms the blockchain into an environment where intelligent agents can live, learn, and evolve.
We call this the AI-native execution layer — a framework where agents are not passive functions but active, persistent participants in the network.Autonomous Agents as First-Class On-Chain Entities
In SeaOS, agents are stateful, context-aware, and behaviorally autonomous. They are not subroutines of contracts but independent intelligent units that:Maintain long-term memory and internal state.Generate dynamic behaviors based on environmental feedback.Collaborate across the ecosystem through semantic communication and task coordination.
This shifts the paradigm from “execution as termination” to execution as continuity — enabling systems that adapt, grow, and self-optimize over time.Deep Semantic Fusion of Smart Contracts and AI Models
Through a modular AI-Contract Layer, SeaOS enables tight integration between model inference and contract logic, at both structural and runtime levels:AI models are embedded as native components within contract workflows.Execution becomes a hybrid of deterministic logic and probabilistic reasoning.Multiple models can coordinate within a single lifecycle, enabling composite behaviors and adaptive strategies.
This integration breaks through the traditional “call-and-return” limitation and enables semantic interoperability between agents and code — a key foundation for truly intelligent dApps.Self-Evolution and Decentralized Scheduling
SeaOS introduces a set of system-level mechanisms that allow agents to self-evolve and coordinate across the network:Agents continuously learn from on-chain data and feedback loops.A decentralized scheduler dynamically allocates compute resources and task routing based on agent priority and system demand.The result is an open, adaptive agent economy — resilient, extensible, and optimized for continuous innovation.System Design: Building the Foundations of an AI-Native Chain
To support these intelligent agents at scale, SeaOS implements a new technical stack:Multi-VM Compatibility: Supports EVM, SVM, and inference-specific virtual machines for heterogeneous execution.AI-Contract Layer: A plug-and-play framework for embedding AI logic into on-chain workflows.Decentralized AI Compute Network: Elastic GPU and edge compute infrastructure for real-time model inference.Autonomous Scheduling Framework: Agent-level orchestration of tasks, resources, and evolution across the network.
Together, these components form the foundation of SeaOS’s on-chain intelligence infrastructure — purpose-built for the age of smart agents.Conclusion: From Contracts to Intelligence
The future of Web3 will not be driven by static smart contracts, but by intelligent, autonomous agents.
To get there, we must go beyond simply “plugging in models.” We need to rethink the very fabric of execution, state, and coordination on-chain — and build systems where intelligence is native, not peripheral.
SeaOS is pioneering this new standard with a system-level redesign that unites AI, blockchain, and autonomy into a single coherent stack. This is not just Smart Contracts 2.0 — it's the Operating System for a decentralized intelligent future.

These autonomous entities, capable of performing tasks and making decisions, hold immense potential. However, for AI agents to move beyond simple, isolated interactions and become truly intelligent and collaborative, they need a robust way to manage and communicate their understanding of the world – their "context." This is where the Model Context Protocol (MCP) comes into play. As a beginner, understanding MCP might seem daunting, but it's a fundamental concept for building effective AI agents. This guide will provide a clear, step-by-step introduction to using MCP for AI agent communication, explaining its core principles, how it facilitates seamless interactions, and why it's crucial for any aspiring AI agent developer. We’ll break down the complexities, making MCP accessible and practical.*Understanding the Core Concept: What is Context in AI Agents?
*
Before diving into MCP, let's clarify what "context" means in the realm of AI agents. Imagine you're talking to a friend. You don't start every sentence by re-explaining everything that's happened previously. You rely on shared understanding, past conversations, and the current situation. This shared understanding is context.For an AI agent, context encompasses all the relevant information it needs to understand its current situation, make informed decisions, and perform tasks coherently. This includes:: What has been said or done in previous turns of interaction. Known preferences of the user (e.g., preferred language, dietary restrictions, favorite products).Environmental State: Real-time data about the agent's operating environment (e.g., current time, weather, stock prices, system status). The overall objective the agent is trying to achieve and the intermediate steps it's working on. Specific information the agent has access to (e.g., product catalogs, company policies). Its current beliefs, reasoning path, and progress on a task.Without context, an AI agent would be like someone with severe short-term memory loss, unable to build on past interactions or understand the nuances of a situation. MCP is essentially the agreed-upon method for how this vital context is packaged, transmitted, and updated among AI agents and the systems they interact with.Why is MCP Essential for AI Agent Communication?Think about a conversation between two people. If they constantly forget what was just said, the conversation breaks down. Similarly, for AI agents, especially when they need to collaborate or handle multi-step tasks, robust communication of context is paramount. MCP addresses several key challenges:Maintaining Coherence in Multi-Turn Interactions: For tasks that involve multiple steps (e.g., booking a trip, troubleshooting an issue), an agent needs to remember previous inputs and decisions. MCP ensures this continuity.Enabling Seamless Collaboration: When different AI agents work together (e.g., a sales agent passing a lead to a customer support agent), they need to share relevant context to avoid redundancy and ensure a smooth handover.Facilitating Personalization: By remembering user preferences and past behaviors, agents can offer more tailored and effective responses, enhancing the user experience.**Improving Efficiency and Accuracy: **Agents with rich context can make more informed decisions, reducing errors and speeding up task completion.Supporting Learning and Adaptation: As agents interact and gather more context, they can learn from these experiences and improve their performance over time.The Building Blocks of MCP: Key ComponentsWhile the exact implementation of MCP can vary, it generally involves several core components that work together to manage context:Context Schema/Ontology: This defines the structure and types of information that constitute the context. It's like a dictionary or blueprint that dictates what data points are relevant and how they relate to each other. For example, a schema for a travel agent might define "destination," "departure date," "traveler name," etc.Context Store/Memory: This is where the actual context data is held. It could be an in-memory store for short-term context (e.g., current conversation state) or a persistent database for long-term context (e.g., user profiles, historical interactions).Context Update Mechanisms: Rules or processes that determine when and how the context is updated. This includes adding new information, modifying existing data, or removing outdated context.Context Retrieval Mechanisms: Methods for AI agents to query and retrieve specific pieces of context when needed. This ensures agents can access relevant information quickly and efficiently.Context Sharing Protocols: The agreed-upon format and methods for exchanging context between different AI agents or between an agent and external systems (e.g., JSON, XML, or specific API endpoints).How MCP Works in Practice: A Simple ScenarioLet’s illustrate MCP with a simple example: an AI agent helping a user order a pizza.User: "I want a pizza."
Agent: "What kind of pizza?"
User: "Pepperoni."
Agent: "What kind of pizza?" (Agent forgot the previous turn)
User: "Pepperoni! And I want a large."
Agent: "What kind of pizza?" (Agent still doesn't remember)
This fragmented interaction is due to a lack of context management.Initial Interaction (User: "I want a pizza.")The user's intent ("order pizza") is detected.MCP records this intent and creates an initial context: {"task": "order_pizza", "status": "initiated"}.First Response (Agent: "What kind of pizza?")The agent accesses the context: {"task": "order_pizza", "status": "initiated"}.
It determines the next piece of missing information is the pizza type.User Input (User: "Pepperoni.")

The agent processes "Pepperoni."
 {"task": "order_pizza", "status": "pizza_type_selected", "pizza_type": "pepperoni"}.
Second Response (Agent: "And what size?")The agent accesses the updated context. It knows the pizza type is "pepperoni" and now needs the size.User Input (User: "And I want a large.")

The agent processes "large."
{"task": "order_pizza", "status": "size_selected", "pizza_type": "pepperoni", "size": "large"}.

Final Confirmation (Agent: "So, a large pepperoni pizza. Is that correct?")The agent accesses the complete context to summarize the order.In this example, MCP ensures the agent "remembers" the pizza type and builds upon previous inputs, leading to a smooth, coherent conversation.Implementing MCP: A Beginner's ApproachFor beginners, implementing MCP might involve:Defining your Context Schema:Start by listing all the pieces of information your AI agent will need to remember for its tasks.Organize these into a logical structure, perhaps using a simple dictionary or JSON object in your code.Example for a customer support agent:{"user_id": "", "issue_type": "", "product_name": "", "conversation_history": []}
Choosing a Context Store:For simple applications, an in-memory dictionary or object can suffice.For more persistent or complex needs, consider a simple database (like SQLite) or a key-value store (like Redis).Designing Context Update Functions:Create functions that take new information and update the context based on predefined rules.update_context(key, value) or add_to_history(message)

Designing Context Retrieval Functions:Create functions to get specific pieces of information from the context.get_context(key) or get_full_history()
Integrating with Your AI Agent Logic:Whenever your AI agent receives a new input or needs to make a decision, it should first retrieve relevant context.After the agent processes the input or performs an action, it should update the context.Tools and Technologies that Support MCP-like Concepts:While "Model Context Protocol" is a conceptual framework, many AI development tools and platforms incorporate mechanisms that align with MCP principles:Dialogue Management Systems: Frameworks like RASA, Dialogflow, and Microsoft Bot Framework explicitly handle session state and context management for conversational AI.Orchestration Layers: Tools that manage the flow of information between different AI models and external systems often incorporate context passing mechanisms.Vector Databases: For advanced context management, especially with LLMs, vector databases can store and retrieve semantic context, allowing agents to understand nuanced relationships between pieces of information.Challenges and Considerations for Beginners:Context Scope: Deciding what information is relevant to keep in context and for how long. Too much context can be unwieldy; too little leads to amnesia.Context Persistence: How to store context across sessions or if an agent needs to restart.Context Conflict Resolution: What happens if different inputs suggest conflicting context?Security and Privacy: Ensuring sensitive context data is handled securely and in compliance with privacy regulations.Scalability: How to manage context for thousands or millions of concurrent agent interactions.For beginners venturing into AI agent development, understanding and implementing Model Context Protocol (MCP) is not just beneficial; it’s essential. MCP provides the critical foundation for AI agents to maintain coherence, learn, collaborate, and deliver truly intelligent and personalized experiences. By grasping the core concepts of context, its storage, update, and retrieval, you can move beyond building simple, reactive bots to crafting sophisticated, proactive AI agents that understand and adapt to their environment and users. As you embark on your journey to build your own AI agents, remember that a robust MCP is the key to unlocking their full potential, enabling them to communicate effectively, remember past interactions, and become indispensable tools in the evolving landscape of AI development. Start simple, iterate, and watch your AI agents become genuinely intelligent conversational partners and task executors.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Internet’s Full of Trash Info, So I Made Nexix.

GCP’s Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the front door every API call must pass. When the fleet that issues and validates OAuth and service account tokens misbehaves, the blast radius reaches storage, compute, control planes essentially everything.Google’s initial incident summary refers to an IAM back‑end rollout issue indicating that a routine update to the IAM service introduced an error that spread before standard canary checks could catch it.Engineers inside Google reportedly rolled back the binary and purged bad configs, then forced token cache refresh across regions. us‑central1 lagged behind because it hosts quorum shards for IAM metadata.
  
  
  2.2 Customer Impact Checklist

  3. Cloudflare’s Dependency Chain Reaction
Cloudflare’s Workers KV stores billions of key‑value entries and replicates them across 270+ edge locations. The hot path is in Cloudflare’s own data centers, but the persistent back‑end is a multi‑region database hosted on Google Cloud. When IAM refused new tokens, Writes and eventually Reads to the backing store timed out.Cloudflare Access uses KV to store session state -> login loopsWARP stores Zero Trust device posture in KV -> client could not handshakeDurable Objects (SQLite) relied on KV for metadata -> subset of DOs failedAI Gateway and Workers AI experienced cold‑start errors due to missing model manifests in KVCloudflare’s incident commander declared a Code Orange their highest severity and spun up a cross‑vendor bridge with Google engineers. Once IAM mitigation took hold, KV reconnected and the edge quickly self‑healed.
  
  
  4. Anthropic Caught in the Crossfire
Anthropic hosts Claude on GCP. The immediate failure mode was file upload (hits Cloud Storage) and image vision features, while raw text prompts sometimes succeeded due to cached tokens.[12:07 PT] status.anthropic.com: "We have disabled uploads to reduce error volume while the upstream GCP incident is in progress. Text queries remain available though elevated error rates persist."Anthropic throttled traffic to keep the service partially usable, then restored uploads after Google’s IAM fleet was stable.Control plane failures hurt more than data plane faults. Data replication across zones cannot save you if auth is down.Check hidden dependencies. Cloudflare is multi‑cloud at the edge, yet a single‑vendor choice deep in the stack still cascaded.Status pages must be fast and honest. Google took nearly an hour to flip the incident flag. Customers were debugging ghosts meanwhile.Design an emergency bypass. If your auth proxy (Cloudflare Access) fails, can you temporarily route around it?Chaos drills still matter. Rare multi‑provider events happen and the playbooks must be rehearsed.Your intelligent coding companion that seamlessly integrates into your workflow.
  
  
  6. Still Waiting for the Full RCAs
Google will publish a postmortem once internal review wraps expect details on the faulty rollout, scope of blast radius and planned guardrails.
Cloudflare traditionally ships a forensic blog within a week. Watch for specifics on Workers KV architecture and new redundancy layers.
  
  
  7. Updated Analysis: What Google's Official Timeline Tells Us
Google's detailed incident timeline reveals several important details not visible from external monitoring:
  
  
  7.1 Root Cause Identification
12:41 PDT: Google engineers identified root cause and applied mitigations13:16 PDT: Infrastructure recovered in all regions except us-central114:00 PDT: Mitigation implemented for us-central1 and multi-region/usThe fact that us-central1 lagged significantly behind suggests this region hosts critical infrastructure components that require special handling during recovery operations.
  
  
  7.2 Phased Recovery Pattern
Infrastructure Layer (12:41-13:16): Underlying dependency fixed globally except one regionProduct Layer (13:45): Most GCP products recovered, some residual impactSpecialized Services (17:10-18:18): Complex services like Dataflow and Vertex AI required additional timeEven after the root cause was fixed, some services took 5+ additional hours to fully recover:Dataflow: Backlog clearing in us-central1 until 17:10 PDTVertex AI: Model Garden 5xx errors persisted until 18:18 PDTPersonalized Service Health: Delayed updates until 17:33 PDTThis demonstrates how cascading failures create recovery debt that extends far beyond the initial fix.At 10:50 AM a bug in a single Google Cloud service took down authentication worldwide. Within half an hour that failure reached Cloudflare and Anthropic. By 1:30 PM everything was green again, but not before reminding the internet just how tangled our dependencies are.Keep an eye out for the official RCAs. Meanwhile, update your incident playbooks, test your failovers and remember that sometimes the cloud’s biggest danger is a bad config on a Tuesday.Let me know you take on this in the comment section below!!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Enhance Apps with Geolocation API for Targeting Users</title><link>https://dev.to/rameshchauhan/enhance-apps-with-geolocation-api-for-targeting-users-301c</link><author>Ramesh Chauhan</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 06:33:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Location data is one of the most powerful tools in a developer’s toolkit. From tailoring content based on city or region to customizing pricing or offers, Geolocation API for personalization and targeting is transforming how small businesses and developers interact with users across the globe.This guide explores how developers, API communities, and small enterprises can integrate a reliable  like ipstack to build smarter, more location-aware applications—without the complexity or high cost of maintaining a custom solution
  
  
  Why Geolocation Matters in 2025
Today’s users are bombarded with generic content and irrelevant offers. The solution? Location-based personalization.
  
  
  According to recent data:
80% of users are more likely to engage with content tailored to their location.Personalized offers can increase conversions by up to 50%.Geotargeting improves customer satisfaction by reducing friction.For developers and small enterprises, integrating a Geolocation API for personalization and targeting enables precise control over what each user sees, based on their IP-determined location—no manual filters or user input needed.
  
  
  What is a Geotargeting API?
A Geotargeting API allows developers to detect a user’s geographical location (country, region, city, ZIP code, etc.) based on their IP address. With this data, you can:Show localized pricing or product optionsAutomatically set language and currencyServe region-specific promotionsBlock or redirect users from restricted regionsTailor security protocols based on geolocation risk factorsIPstack is a leading choice for developers looking for a fast, accurate, and affordable API to geotarget users globally.: A Powerful Tool for Smart TargetingIPstack is a real-time IP geolocation API that provides precise location data for any IP address.

With ipstack, you can detect a user's country and dynamically load the relevant language and currency:.then(response => response.json())const userCountry = data.country_code;if (userCountry === "FR") {// Load French language pack and EUR pricing} else if (userCountry === "US") {// Load English language pack and USD pricingThis simple call enables real-time content personalization, increasing engagement while improving SEO with region-specific content.
  
  
  Use Geolocation for Security & Fraud Detection
Many developers don’t realize that Geolocation API for personalization and targeting also enhances security. If your web app detects a login from an unexpected location, you can trigger multi-factor authentication or even block the attempt.Python Example for IP Threat Detection:
pythonaccess_key = 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'response = requests.get(url)if data['security']['is_proxy']:print("Possible fraudulent activity detected!")This makes ipstack especially valuable for small e-commerce platforms and SaaS tools.
  
  
  How Small Enterprises Can Leverage Geolocation
Small businesses often struggle with limited resources. ipstack offers tools that simplify and automate user targeting—without needing expensive CRM platforms or analytics suites.1. Show Local Currency Automatically
Increase trust and reduce cart abandonment by showing pricing in local currency using the user's location.2. Regional Product Restrictions
Easily restrict products or services to certain countries or states without building complex custom logic.
Serve content that’s optimized for regional keywords, helping your site rank better in local search results.4. Analyze Global Traffic
Use IP data to monitor where your traffic comes from and which locations are converting best.
  
  
  The Developer Experience: Plug, Play, and Personalize
One of the standout features of IPstack is its developer-first approach.

As ferramentas baseadas em IA facilitam o aprendizado, personalizam a experiência e tornam o estudo de programação mais acessível para pessoas de todos os níveis. Neste artigo, vamos entender como essa revolução está acontecendo e quais benefícios ela traz para estudantes e educadores.
  
  
  Como a inteligência artificial está revolucionando o ensino de tecnologia e programação em 2025?
A resposta é simples: a IA está tornando o aprendizado mais personalizado, eficiente e interativo. Ferramentas inteligentes avaliam o nível de cada aluno e oferecem conteúdos e exercícios adequados, acelerando a curva de aprendizado como mostra o relatório do World Economic Forum sobre o futuro da educação e do trabalho. Além disso, a IA permite que estudantes recebam feedback instantâneo e contínuo, o que antes só era possível com acompanhamento humano constante.
Por exemplo, plataformas como o GitHub Copilot ajudam alunos a entenderem trechos de código e sugerem correções enquanto eles programam. Ao mesmo tempo, assistentes virtuais respondem dúvidas técnicas e explicam conceitos complexos em linguagem acessível. Isso faz com que o ensino de tecnologia e programação, em 2025, seja muito mais dinâmico e menos dependente de métodos tradicionais, tornando o aprendizado mais atrativo e eficiente.
  
  
  Quais são as principais ferramentas de IA utilizadas no ensino de programação hoje?
Hoje, várias ferramentas baseadas em IA já fazem parte do cotidiano de estudantes e professores de tecnologia. Entre as mais populares estão: sugere código e ajuda na escrita de programas. respondem perguntas, simulam diálogos e tiram dúvidas em tempo real. usam algoritmos para ajustar o conteúdo e exercícios conforme o progresso do aluno, como a Khan Academy com recursos de IA.Sistemas de correção automática: avaliam códigos enviados pelos alunos e dão feedback instantâneo.Essas ferramentas atuam de forma integrada, tornando o ensino mais personalizado e ajudando a superar as dificuldades comuns no aprendizado de linguagens e conceitos de programação.IA na educação e o reforço do pensamento críticoMesmo com todos os avanços tecnológicos, é essencial que o uso da inteligência artificial no ensino de tecnologia também estimule o pensamento crítico dos alunos. Ferramentas automatizadas não devem substituir completamente o raciocínio humano, especialmente quando se trata de resolver problemas lógicos ou entender conceitos complexos.Por isso, estratégias pedagógicas que combinam IA e raciocínio ativo continuam sendo valorizadas. Um bom exemplo é quando os professores propõem atividades em que o aluno deve: identifique a alternativa errada e corrija-a no caderno, mesmo após receber sugestões da IA. Essa prática garante que o estudante não apenas aceite a resposta da máquina, mas reflita sobre ela, analise os erros e desenvolva autonomia intelectual.
  
  
  Quais benefícios a IA traz para professores e alunos no ensino de tecnologia?
A inteligência artificial beneficia tanto os alunos quanto os educadores. Para os alunos, a IA oferece um aprendizado customizado, que respeita o ritmo individual e identifica pontos fortes e fracos com precisão. Isso evita a frustração comum ao tentar acompanhar um ritmo fixo para todos.
Para os professores, a IA reduz o tempo gasto em tarefas repetitivas, como corrigir exercícios básicos, permitindo que eles foquem em atividades mais criativas e no suporte individualizado aos alunos que precisam de atenção especial. Além disso, a IA oferece dados valiosos sobre o desempenho da turma, facilitando a adaptação das aulas para atingir melhores resultados.
  
  
  Quais são os desafios e cuidados no uso da inteligência artificial no ensino?
Apesar dos avanços, a utilização da IA no ensino de tecnologia e programação em 2025 exige atenção. É fundamental garantir que as ferramentas respeitem a privacidade dos usuários e que o uso da IA não crie dependência, prejudicando o desenvolvimento do raciocínio crítico e da autonomia dos alunos.
Além disso, existe o desafio de evitar vieses presentes nos algoritmos, que podem afetar negativamente o aprendizado de certos grupos. Portanto, educadores e desenvolvedores devem trabalhar juntos para implementar soluções inclusivas e transparentes.Como vimos, a inteligência artificial está revolucionando o ensino de tecnologia e programação em 2025, trazendo personalização, eficiência e interatividade ao aprendizado. As ferramentas de IA permitem que alunos aprendam no seu ritmo e que professores otimizem seu tempo, tornando o processo educacional mais moderno e eficaz. Contudo, é essencial usar essas tecnologias de forma ética e consciente, garantindo que o ensino continue sendo humanizado e acessível para todos.
A revolução promovida pela IA no ensino não apenas transforma o presente, mas também abre caminhos para um futuro onde o aprendizado de tecnologia será cada vez mais inclusivo e adaptado às necessidades individuais.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Day 2: {Not Easy Neither Hard}</title><link>https://dev.to/sohmkaviskar/day-2-not-easy-neither-hard-8no</link><author>Soham Kaviskar</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 06:05:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Day 2 of Learning Python started with len [Subscripting]Imagine you want a Specific Letter of Any Unique word From this word if you specifically want the letter  " H " to be printed

  Engineering Cognitive Iteration in OrKa 0.7.0
I Don't Want Consensus. I Want Conflict That EvolvesWhat if intelligence doesn’t live in answers, but in the iteration between disagreements?That’s the premise. Not optimization. Not output. Not even explainability. The real goal is to observe the serial evolution of internal beliefs inside an artificial society. Not artificial intelligence artificial .And for that, OrKa 0.7.0 is finally mature enough.In this piece, I document the construction of an experiment where agents don't just act, they , they , they , and eventually , but only if they choose to. It’s not consensus by design. It’s convergence through structured chaos.
  
  
  I. Conceptual Core: Loop-Driven, Memory-Aware Agent Societies
Instead of stateless workflows, I want:Stateful agents with delayed memoryA moderator that observes, suggests, never forcesA traceable loop of cognitive revisionVolitional stance shifts (or resistance)Each iteration adds friction.
Each loop adds memory.a path of thought emerges.This isn’t a flowchart. It’s .
  
  
  II. Agent Design: Roles Built for Friction
: formal logic, rule-based, fact-first: moral-based reasoning, focuses on harm or intent: default contrarian, refuses coherence if uncertainty exists: memory fetcher, returns past outputs from all agents with delay: calculates agreement, synthesizes views, and proposes a convergence pathMemory: per-agent episodic + shared short-termLatency: historian reads delayed memory only (e.g. from loop N-2)Autonomy: agents never required to agreeEach agent receives its own scoped prompt structure and selectively filtered memory.
  
  
  III. Loop Mechanics: Iteration Until (Optional) Agreement
The orchestration architecture isn’t linear. It loops until one of two things happens: >= threshold (e.g. 0.85)max loop iterations hit (e.g. 7 rounds)Agents write outputs → memoryModerator reviews all, calculates disagreement vectorModerator synthesizes and emits a suggestionEach agent , decides to:Accept it

New round begins with memory augmented by last roundThis creates a serialized cognitive dialogue.Generated by comparing semantic and structural similarity across agent outputs.A synthetic framing that describes the consensus space:"Two agents favor path A. Skeptic resists due to risk. Consensus leans toward caution."

  V. What Emerges From Loops
This loop isn’t wasteful. It’s generative.Over time, memory accretes and agents:Reject framing and escalate contradictionOr evolve their views subtly over timeModeration isn't a convergence engine. It’s a .Divergent clusters that collapseRebellious agents that hold position until others shiftShifts in tone, not just contentEventually, a story appears. A .

  Document actual belief trajectories you observe:
Resistant clusters that eventually collapseAgents that maintain position until others shiftEmergence of unexpected consensus pointsThe actual "thoughtlines" that emerge. This approach leverages OrKa's maturity while pioneering artificial deliberation. You're essentially building a belief state machine with memory persistence, which is exactly what AGI research needs more of.Ready to start building this cognitive iteration system?

But how does it actually work under the hood? Let’s dive in.First, remember: RAG can retrieve from  data source—Google Drive, SQL tables, plain text files, or a vector store. In this example, we’ll focus on a vector‑store‑based pipeline, but the principles carry over.
  
  
  𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝟏: Generate Embeddings
Before you can search, you need numeric representations:Split files into 500–1,000 character chunks
Ensures long documents stay within LLM context limits
Convert chunks to vectorsUse an embedding model (e.g., )
Each chunk → a multi‑dimensional vector
Store in a vector databasePinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS
Free/personal tiers handle small‑scale projects
Experiment with different chunk sizes—too large and you lose semantic focus, too small and you lose context.
  
  
  𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝟐: Handle Retrieval, Generation & UI
This is the classic “vanilla RAG” flow:Convert the question into a vector with the same embedding model
Find the top‑k nearest chunks in your vector DB (e.g., k = 5)
Concatenate retrieved chunks with the original question
Feed the assembled prompt into an LLM (e.g., GPT‑4o‑mini)
Model returns a coherent answer
Use a simple no‑code UI like Lovable (free tier) to wire up the front end in minutes.Dynamically choose the best data source (SQL vs Drive vs Vector DB)
Reformulate queries based on user intent (e.g., translate multilingual queries)
Combine keyword search + semantic vector retrieval
Merge results from multiple sources for broader coverage

  
  
  𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝟑: Evaluate Your RAG System
A RAG system has two distinct parts—retrieval and generation—each needing its own metrics:Recall@k / Precision@k: Did you fetch the right chunks?
MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank): How high is the first correct chunk ranked?
BLEU / ROUGE: Overlap with reference answers (if you have ground truth)
Human evaluations: relevance, coherence, hallucination rate

  
  
  The Recommended Tech Stack (Mostly Free!)
Drag‑and‑drop chatbot builderConnect APIs, schedule workflowsOpenAI GPT‑4o‑mini (<\$2 for 100s of requests)Lightweight, fast inferenceOpenAI Good trade‑off between speed & accuracyPinecone (Starter free tier)Simple REST API, low‑latency searchStore PDFs, docs; integrate via n8n connectorWith free tiers and pay‑as‑you‑go APIs, you can prototype a fully functional RAG chatbot for under $5.

  1. Why split the backend from Django?
Django excels at session-based web apps, but long-running AI calls and headless browser automation can block the asyncio loop and exhaust Gunicorn workers. Off-loading these tasks to a dedicated FastAPI + Celery stack keeps the main web app snappy and horizontally scalable.
  
  
  2. Task pipeline in depth
 — Given a URL, spin up a Playwright context, authenticate if needed, and extract the raw HTML. — Clean the HTML with  and remove boilerplate like nav bars. — Apply a profanity filter and redact PII (Personally Identifiable Information).cover_letter_generation.py — Build a prompt, call the LLM, and stream tokens back to the client.Each step is  and logged to  so that reruns don't re-crawl the same page unnecessarily.
  
  
  3. Robust logging & error handling
Every function is wrapped with  and granular exception catching so that a failure in Playwright doesn't bring down the entire worker. Logs are shipped to CloudWatch in production and to files locally.Use  to add exponential retries for transient errors.Capture full tracebacks but redact sensitive env vars before shipping logs.
  
  
  4. Local development in one command
docker compose  docker-compose.yml up Keep tasks small & serializable — Pass only JSON-serializable payloads to Celery.Don't scrape inside the web worker — Off-load any I/O-heavy scraping to dedicated workers to avoid timeouts. —  in  catches mis-configured env vars at startup.The Backend may sit quietly behind the scenes, but it enables the AI magic users see on the frontend. By modularizing each concern—HTTP I/O, task queuing, scraping, and LLM calls—you gain a pipeline that's easier to observe, scale, and extend.Questions or feedback?

A bad prompt can lead to the wrong code being generated and hours spent reprompting or manually investigating and fixing code. A good prompt leads to the correct code being generated with you only needing to review and test.I've been using Ryan Carson's Cursor rules to help create a clear task list for the features I work on. That task list then forms a series of well-structured prompts you can give to AI to gradually implement the feature step by step. You're front-loading the work and slowing down the start of the development process to be much faster at the end.This process works particularly well on large, complex, or unique features that AI will struggle to "one-shot". It adds structure to the process, allowing you to manually review and test code at appropriate times. The process adds reliability for large features because it's broken down into small chunks that AI has a good chance of getting right.I recently used this process to create a person card web component like this:I did try to "one-shot" this including the UI mockups as images, but it didn't get close. It struggled particularly around keyboard accessibility in the menu. Reprompting made things worse - I ended up spending lots of time without getting very far. I needed a more structured approach.To add Ryan Carson's Cursor rules to a project, create a  folder in the project root and copy and paste the 3 rules ( files) from the GitHub repository into it. I have the  set to  so that I explicitly need to mention it in a prompt to use it.A PRD is a Product Requirements Document that outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the person card web component in this case. Creating the PRD is the first step in the process.You don't have to write the PRD yourself. AI can do the heavy lifting - you just need to provide a couple of sentences to kick things off using the  Cursor rule. This was my prompt to start the PRD creation process:using @create-prd.mdc create a PRD for a reusble person card web component.
There are UX mocks of the card in the @ux-mocks folder.
You don't have to be very specific because AI will ask you questions to firm up the requirements:You can reference the question numbers in the reply - here was mine:1. Name, role, status, email, when joined, location. Card is interactive - view profile button + actions on a menu
2. Some of the uses cases are as you suggest. For internal staff
3. Vanilla web component. All major browsers. Not themable. Fixed size
4. Menu should be triggered using click/Enter and arrow keys should move through menu items. Should be positioned in the card at the top right. Menu should close when click outside or ESC
5. Aria labels, keyboard support, screen reader support
6. Use plain css for styling. No variants. Use shadow dom to isolate styles
AI goes off and creates the PRD in markdown format in the  folder.You can then manually tweak the PRD if necessary or even reprompt AI to make changes. It's important that the PRD is very clear on what you want done.I was satisfied with what it generated and ready to move on to the task list generation.You then get AI to generate a task list using the  Cursor rule.I did this in a new chat thread. This was my prompt:Generate tasks for @prd-person-card-component.md using @generate-tasks
AI generates tasks and asks whether to generate subtasks. I just typed  and it completed the task list, creating a new markdown file in the  folder.You can tweak the task list or ask AI to make changes. I removed tasks around documentation and a showcase page which I didn't require at this stage. I also wanted to be specific about using Vitest and DOM Testing Library for unit tests.I like having the checkboxes and the task list in the source code so it can be used to track progress. Obviously when the feature is done the task file and PRD can be deleted, but it's useful to keep them to refer to if there are any future questions.With a clear task list in place, I was now ready for AI to help me write the code.The  Cursor rule helps implement the code for each task. The rule also tells AI mark complete and move to task next after confirmation from you. Here was my prompt:Using @process-task-list, start processing tasks-prd-person-card-component.md.
Do only the first subtask and wait for me to review before continuing.
Even though the Cursor rule says "One subtask at a time" I find I need to remind AI of this - hence the second sentence in the prompt. You can also just hit the  option in Cursor if you see it doing more than it should be doing.I find it important to review and test the code after each subtask. The code can be tested before the change is accepted. The code can also be tweaked if necessary - manually or via an AI prompt.Taking the time to review and test the code after each subtask may seem overkill but it helps catch AI going a little off track and enables you to understand the generated code. There's an urge to just move on to the next subtask, but resisting this will likely mean you complete the feature more efficiently.Here are a couple of prompts for changes in the early tasks:- Use proper private members instead of TS ones
- Use arrow functions to avoid the "this" problem in the WC class
- Use :focus-visible rather than :focus for focus indicators
It's worth noting that these code preferences can be added to Cursor rules. I don't write many web components, so I didn't have anything in place.Sometimes AI doesn't mark the subtask as complete but a quick  prompts it to do so.When I'm ready to move to the next subtask, I prompt "Move to the next subtask" in the same thread, even if you've prompted for code changes after the previous subtask.I generally complete all the subtasks in a single thread and start a new thread for a new task. Here was my prompt to start the 2nd task:Using @process-task-list, carry on processing tasks-prd-person-card-component.md on task 2 subtask 2.1.
Allow me to review before continuing.
As I move through the tasks, you may find some that are already partially or fully complete. I found this with "Task 2.4 Implement menu item actions by dispatching custom events". AI reworked the code to use an event handler for each menu item rather than a single one. So, I prompted:The previous implementation is fine - a single event with the option name in the event data
AI agreed and gave the reason (simpler code, consistent API, flexible). This gave me confidence in my judgement.So, it's even more important to thoroughly review and test the code through the final steps to avoid unnecessary code being added.Towards the end of the task list I adjust my task kickoff prompt to the following to get AI to think about the possibility of the task already being completed:Using @process-task-list, carry on processing tasks-prd-person-card-component.md on task X subtask X.1.
Allow me to review before continuing.
You may find a subtask is already completed, so only make changes if necessary and can make improvements.
AI did make some useful improvements to subtasks that were already partially complete. For example:Smooth transitions for focus/hover statesHigh contrast mode supportAddition of a component initialised eventOverall, it took me a couple of hours to build the person card component using this approach. The process wasn't perfect - it did go off track a few times. However, getting it back on track was quick because the iterations are small and very focused.I'm going to continue to use this process for work that won't "one-shot". I'd encourage you to give it a try. Maybe this kind of flow will be a feature built into Cursor one day?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Seeking Contributors for PoC Development of My Concepts</title><link>https://dev.to/hejhdiss/seeking-contributors-for-poc-development-of-my-concepts-4cmm</link><author>Muhammed Shafin P</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 03:51:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm working on a set of my concepts and currently focusing on building proof-of-concept (PoC) implementations for selected parts of each.

Those of you who follow me on X/Twitter (as @ChristosArgyrop and @ArgyropChristos),Bluesky , mast.hpc, mstdn.science, mstdn.social know that I have been very critical of the hype behind AI and the hallucinations of both models and the 
human AI influencers (informally known as  in some corners of the web). However, there are application areas of vibe coding with AI, e.g. semi-automating the task of creating API from one one language to another, in which the chatbots may actually deliver well and act as productivity boosters.
In this application area, we will be leveraging the AI tools as more or less enhanced auto-complete tools that can help a developer navigate less familiar, more technical and 
possibly more boring aspects of the target language's 'guts'. If AI were to deliver in this area, then meaningless language wars can be averted, and  (at least in my opinion) reasons
to prefer one language, i.e. the availability of some exotic library, may be avoided. For my foray in this area, I chose to interface to the library Bit that I  wrote to support text fingerprinting for some research 
applications. The library based on David Hanson's Bit_T library discussed in Chapter 13 of "C Interfaces and Implementations"
has been extended to incorporate additional operations on bitsets (such as counts on unions/differences/intersections of sets) and fast population counts in both CPU and GPU 
(with TPU implementations coming down the road). Hence, this is a test case that can illustrate the utility of Perl in using code that executes transparently in various hardware assets. 
Similar to Hanson's original implementation (after all, my work is based on his!) the library interface is implemented to 
an Abstract Data Type in C; a crucial aspect of the implementation is to manage memory and avoid leaks without looking (at all, or as little as possible!) under the hood.
For our experiments we will use Claude 3.7 Thinking Sonnet through the Github Copilot  interface. This is going to be a multipart series post that will be published throughout the summer. 
Our focus will be on interactions between me and the bot, and in particular critiquing the responses it has given me for both high level (e.g. choice of approach) and technical aspects of the project.For the prompt I provided the "bit.c", "bit.h", makefile and the readme file of the Bit github repository as context to Claude and then I issued the following:Look at the bit.h file that defines two abstract data types Bit_T and Bit_T_DB
and their interfaces in C. I would like to wrap these interfaces in Perl.
The build process will  consist of using the Alien package in Perl to make bit available to Perl.
Explore possible options for the creation of the interface: 
A. Creation of the bit  C library :
1) compiling bit.c and bit.h as dynamic libraries
2) compiling bit.c nd bit.h into a static library
B. Interfacing with the bit C library from Perl:
1) using SWIG i files
2) using Platypus::FFI
3) using Inline::C
4) using XS

Since you are an expert with deep knowledge of the Perl ecosystem, consider pros and cons of
each approach. and then recommend the optimal Consider lightweight options for encapsulating
the Bit_T and Bit_T_DB abstract data types as Perl objects.
Provide wrapping recommendations targetting a beginner, intermediate and experienced Perl
programmer since those may differ.  When providing recommendations , consider the dependencies
that are required for each implementation and highlight them in your analysis.
Once you have provided the recommendation, provide the implementation of the wrapper for
these 3 programmer levels. To reduce the token output (and your risk of hallucinating),
provide a full implementation of the wrapper for the beginner level and only the
changes (if any) that are required for the intermediate and advanced programmer levels.

In my prompt specification, I clearly specified that linkage to the foreign library could be either as a static or a dynamic object,the desired way to package the dependency for use in Perl is an Alien packageall four possible ways to interface to a foreign library from Perl should be considered.asked it to consider the problem of wrapping from the perspective of Perl developers with different levels of expertise.Note that I gave the bot considerable freedom over the "low" level aspects of wrapping (type of library, choice of the cross-language interface), 
but restricted it in terms of  I wanted the library served. 
Furthermore, I guided it to consider alternative viewpoints and level of expertise, providing a unique opportunity to test Claude's  of conversations about wrappers. Finally, I alerted the chatbot to consider the token-sequence length dependent risk of hallucinations and
tried to limit the length of the output of the alternative implementations. The output based on this prompt is shown below (inside the horizontal lines);  the formatting was also part of the outputLet me analyze the options for creating a Perl interface to the Bit_T and Bit_T_DB C library and provide implementation recommendations for programmers at different experience levels.
  
  
  A. Creation of the Bit C Library

  
  
  1. Dynamic Library Approach
I see the Makefile already creates a dynamic library () in the  directory with this rule:CCCFLAGSLDFLAGSRuntime binding, reducing memory footprintUpdates to the library don't require recompiling Perl codeAlready implemented in your build systemBetter for distributing the library separately from the wrapperDeployment requires ensuring the library is in the system pathPotential version compatibility issues
  
  
  2. Static Library Approach
To compile as a static library, you would modify the Makefile:BUILD_DIR/libbit.a


    ar rcs Self-contained distributionNo runtime dependency resolutionPotentially faster function callsNo path issues during deploymentNeed to recompile wrapper if library changesLess memory efficient if multiple programs use the library
  
  
  B. Perl Interfacing Options
Automated wrapper generationSupports multiple languages (future portability)Good for complex interfacesLearning curve for SWIG interface filesAdditional build dependencyNo compilation required at installation timeModern, actively maintainedSuitable for your library structureRequires FFI::Platypus and related modulesLess efficient for very complex interfacesSimple integration of C code directly in PerlNo separate interface filesC compiler required at runtimeLess suitable for large librariesPerformance overhead for initializationStandard Perl way to interface with CTight integration with Perl's memory managementVerbose, low-level codingMore complex build process
  
  
  Recommendation for Each Level

  
  
  Beginner Level: FFI::Platypus with Dynamic Library
FFI::Platypus provides the easiest approach for beginners with minimal C knowledge. It works with your existing dynamic library build.
  
  
  Intermediate Level: Inline::C with Dynamic Library
Inline::C offers more control for intermediate users who understand some C code but want to avoid complex build processes.
  
  
  Advanced Level: XS with Static Library
XS provides the highest performance and greatest control, suitable for experienced Perl programmers.
  
  
  Implementation for Beginner Level: FFI::Platypus
Let's create the Alien::Bit module first to handle library discovery, then implement Bit::Set and Bit::Set::DB modules using FFI::Platypus.
  
  
  Step 1: Create Alien::Bit module

  
  
  Step 2: Create Bit::Set module for individual bitsets

  
  
  Step 3: Create Bit::Set::DB module for packed containers

  
  
  Step 4: Example usage script

  
  
  Modifications for Intermediate Level (Inline::C)
For intermediate-level Perl programmers, here are the changes required to implement the wrapper using Inline::C:
  
  
  Modifications for Advanced Level (XS)
For advanced Perl programmers, here are the key changes required to implement using XS:And update the Makefile.PL:For most users, especially beginners, the FFI::Platypus approach offers the best balance of simplicity, 
performance, and maintainability. It works well with your existing dynamic library build process and 
provides a clean, object-oriented interface to the Bit_T and Bit_T_DB types. The implementation provided 
covers all the core functionality while being extensible for additional features as needed.In this first post, we will not consider the implementation(s) which will be covered in separate posts, but will restrict ourselves to Claude's output with respect to the other questions. I give Claude bonus points for clearly identifying the niches for each potential choice: Highighting that SWIG can support wrapping for other languages) Proposing Foreign Function Interface for linking to the dynamic library for beginners. A experienced programmer would opt for XS is not a surprise at all.the choice of Inline for the intermediate user is head-scratching: it seems that the chatbot closed on the intermediate level of programming experience in the prompt, and the selection of the approach was driven entirely by the fact that the user could (presumably) do more stuff in C.SWIG was not considered as suitable (perhaps because few people in the training databases use SWIG) for implementing at any level. Without going into the specifics of the implementation though, I'd feel comfortable opting for FFI as an initial step for largely the reasons identified by Claude. We will have more things to say about the FFI implementation in the subsequent post in this series.Note, I did not use the word understanding, as I do not think that LLMs can understant: they are merely noisy statistical pattern generators that can be tasked to create rough solutions for refining.

The difference? One saves you minutes. The other saves you entire departments worth of effort.That’s the real promise of AI in operations. And not just surface-level automation like email sorting or chatbot scripts. We're talking about building intelligent back-end systems that anticipate needs, self-improve, and reroute themselves when things go sideways.What Operational AI Actually Looks LikeLet’s get specific. Imagine a logistics company using AI to:Predict delivery delays based on historical traffic and weather dataAutomatically reassign drivers to meet SLAsOptimize warehouse picking routes based on current demandReduce idle inventory through demand-based forecastingEach of these touches different systems. They require not just good models—but integration, logic design, real-time data streaming, and feedback loops.That’s what development services offer: the bridge between AI theory and operational results.AI as the Glue Between Disjointed SystemsIf you’ve worked in operations, you know the biggest bottleneck often isn’t people—it’s platforms. Tools that don’t talk to each other. Data stuck in silos. Insights buried in spreadsheets.AI done right acts as the glue between these parts:A model reads CRM data, correlates it with inventory logs, and triggers actions in your ERP.Anomaly detection tools run quietly in the background, flagging issues before humans spot them.Predictive alerts help managers reallocate resources before a backlog snowballs.This orchestration is what makes modern operations resilient—and it starts with a partner who can architect that intelligence.Avoiding the Trap of Over-AutomationLet’s be clear: not every process needs a neural network. And not every workflow should be handed over to an algorithm.Great AI developers know where to draw the line. They ask:Is this process repetitive and data-rich?Are the stakes low enough to start small?Can we include human-in-the-loop options?Artificial intelligence development services that succeed in ops don’t just automate—they enhance. They leave room for human judgment where it matters, while removing friction where it doesn’t.Real Examples: AI in ActionHere are a few real-world wins we’ve seen from custom AI systems in ops:Insurance Claims: NLP models that read, classify, and triage incoming claims, cutting manual review time by 60%Manufacturing: Vision systems that detect defects earlier in the assembly line, reducing rework costsCustomer Service: Sentiment models that escalate high-risk interactions faster, improving retentionThese aren’t futuristic dreams. They’re running in production today—because businesses invested in the right AI talent early.Thinking in Loops, Not LanesAI is most effective when it’s not thought of as a project, but a system. Not a feature, but a loop:Collect → Learn → Decide → Act → RepeatThis is where custom development services shine. They don’t just build models and walk away. They design systems that learn from themselves. Systems that evolve.And that means your operations keep getting sharper, leaner, and faster—not just once, but continuously.Final Thoughts: Rethink What’s PossibleIf your ops team still relies on weekly reports and gut checks to make decisions, you’re playing defense.The result? Less firefighting. More foresight.Fewer meetings. More momentum.Smarter operations. Happier teams.And most importantly, a business that runs itself—so you can focus on what comes next.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Make requests to your API through AI 👇</title><link>https://dev.to/onedev/make-requests-to-your-api-through-ai-3h5m</link><author>OneDev</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 23:35:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Build AI-Driven API Requests in Your React App — With Natural Language]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>azd CLI extension framework</title><link>https://dev.to/kristenwomack/azd-cli-extension-framework-4kh4</link><author>Kristen Womack</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 23:13:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
  
  
  I wrote about azd extensions, a new way to customize the Azure Developer CLI
We recently added a new alpha feature to the Azure Developer CLI () that lets you build and share your own CLI commands. The idea is simple: sometimes you want  to do something specific to your project or workflow, maybe scaffold a repo, run a custom validation, or integrate with a tool your team uses. Now you can do that with azd extensions.Here’s a quick example to enable extensions and install one:azd config set alpha.extensions on
azd extension install microsoft.azd.demo
azd extension list --installed
You can also create your own:# Install the azd developer extension
azd extension install microsoft.azd.extensions
# Initialize a new extension project
azd x init
The post walks through how the framework works, what you can build, and how to get started. If you’re into CLI tooling or open-source workflows, I’d love to hear what you think.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Which Code Assistant Actually Helps Developers Grow? Part 2</title><link>https://dev.to/bekahhw/which-code-assistant-actually-helps-developers-grow-part-2-24p8</link><author>BekahHW</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 23:05:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A follow-up to "Which Code Assistant Actually Helps Developers Grow?" This time, testing how AI assistants handle debugging existing code problems.I inherited a mobile navigation issue on my writing site. The navbar wasn't responsive, leaving a ton of white space on mobile screens and making it a less-than-desirable experience. Instead of a full navigation bar cramming into mobile view, I needed a proper hamburger menu.Here's what I told each assistant:"There's an issue with mobile view on the site. I think the main problem is with the navbar. But I don't think it makes sense to have a nav bar for a mobile site. We should make the site responsive and add a sticky nav bar with a hamburger menu instead of the full navigation bar once the site hits mobile-sized screens."Here's how Continue, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor handled this real-world debugging scenario.
  
  
  Continue: Permission-Driven and Educational
I used Continue in Agent mode, giving it context from , , and .Created a dedicated hamburger menu componentAsked for permission between file changesWhen I got a transparency issue with the menu panel, it fixed it in one goIt added comments to understand the steps it was taking in the code and debug logs in the code to help me see what was working and whenEverything worked within 12 minutesWhen I tested the same fix using Continue's Chat mode instead of Agent mode, it took longer but provided much more thorough explanations. The conversation was more educational, walking me through the reasoning behind each change.It is worth noting that Continue allows you to set rules, so if learning is your priority, you can create a rule for that.Here's an example from their docs: Continue balances efficiency with learning. Agent mode got me working code fast, while Chat mode taught me the "why" behind the solutions.
  
  
  GitHub Copilot: Fast & (a bit) Frustrating
Copilot started by unnecessarily converting a Svelte component, then immediately threw a TypeScript error:Argument of type 'EventTarget' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Node'I'm not sure why it decided that the  needed to be converted. At the very least, that's outside of the scope of this PR, in my opinion.It was able to solve the problem pretty quickly when I used the "Fix with Copilot" function, explaining, "You should cast e.target to Node when passing it to .contains() to resolve the type error."The hamburger menu initially didn't appear at all. The responsiveness was "fixed" because the navigation disappeared, but users couldn't access any menu items.After back-and-forth debugging, Copilot resorted to  declarations (not ideal) and the old "turn the background red" debugging trick. Even when the menu became visible, clicking it did nothing.Eventually, we identified JavaScript as the culprit. Copilot fixed it, but then the menu links appeared directly over the page content without any background container. More back-and-forth with questionable styling decisions followed.It was to the point where I definitely could fix this faster than having a back-and-forth with Copilot, so I called it. After that, I also realized there was a bug where, after expanding the hamburger menu on mobile and then switching to desktop view, the mobile menu remained open on top of the restored navigation bar.: About 20 minutes, with me ultimately fixing the styles myself.: Minimal. Copilot told me what it was doing, but didn't really explain its approach or help me understand the underlying problem.
  
  
  Cursor: Comprehensive but Presumptuous
Cursor's response was immediate and organized:Automatically read the global CSSOutlined exactly what needed to change and whyProvided all necessary file updatesHit the same cross-page JavaScript issue as CopilotCursor went beyond my request, automatically improving mobile styles across the site that I hadn't asked for. This raises an interesting question: should AI assistants make assumptions about what you "really" need?: About 15 minutes to complete.: Good explanations of changes. I appreciate that it gives more information on why errors were happening in the context of using Astro.Here's something I noticed that none of the assistants addressed: familiarity bias. Cursor and GitHub Copilot felt nearly identical to use, so I moved faster with them. Continue required slightly more of a learning curve, which actually slowed me down initially but provided better educational value.This isn't a knock against Continue. It's a reminder that switching tools comes with costs, even when the new tool might be better in the long term.
  
  
  Debugging vs. Building: Different Skills Required
This debugging scenario revealed something my first test missed, that building new features and fixing existing problems require different AI assistance approaches.Focus on "what should this do?"Understanding legacy decisionsFocusing on "why isn't this working?"Continue did well with the debugging mindset, asking permission before changes and explaining the reasoning. Copilot and Cursor were more aggressive about "fixing" things, sometimes creating new problems in the process.
  
  
  Which AI Coding Assistant Wins for Debugging?
: Continue, especially in Chat mode. It helped me understand not just what was broken, but why the original approach failed.: Cursor, if you don't mind AI making assumptions about improvements you didn't request.This comparison reinforced something I mentioned in my first post: the tool is only part of the equation. Each assistant performed differently not just because of their capabilities, but because of how they approached the problem-solving process.Continue treated debugging as a learning opportunity. Copilot treated it as a code completion task. Cursor treated it as a comprehensive redesign project.If you want to know which coding assistant helps developers grow when you're debugging, try this: Before asking for a fix, ask the AI to help you understand why the original code failed. The debugging skills you develop will be more valuable than any individual fix.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>5 Boring Tasks I Gave to My AI Agent Today (That Saved Me Hours)</title><link>https://dev.to/blockopensource/5-boring-tasks-i-gave-to-my-ai-agent-today-that-saved-me-hours-45ef</link><author>Angie Jones</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 22:34:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Whenever people talk about AI, they highlight the flashiest use cases like fully coded apps built by agents or cinematic video generation. Those things are certainly cool, but most days I'm just delegating mundane tasks to the bots. Today, I didn't build an app. I didn't write a screenplay. I just got stuff done.Here are 5 real, everyday tasks I gave to my AI agent, Goose, that saved me hours. None of them took more than one minute from prompt to result.For all of these, I used Anthropic's Claude 4 Sonnet
  
  
  1️⃣ Summarizing GitHub Activity into Actionable Insights
I asked Goose to review all closed GitHub issues across my organization for the month and give me a breakdown. I wanted to see where our time went, how work was distributed, and any patterns or dependencies across projects.In under a minute, Goose gave me a report with productivity metrics, workload distribution, and notable dependencies between issue threads (e.g. one fix blocking another).This kind of synthesis normally requires me to manually scan a bunch of repos and cross-reference PRs or issue comments. Not today.
  
  
  2️⃣ Extracting Action Items from a Long Slack Thread
You know when a Slack thread starts as a quick brainstorm and somehow grows into a novel? Ours had 169 replies today 😂, and buried in there were some important ideas.So, I asked Goose to analyze the entire thread and extract a clean list of action items.In one minute, I had a focused to-do list with responsible parties, deadlines (when mentioned), and themes. These takeaways will likely shape our Q3 goals, and when I'm ready, I can even have Goose go create GitHub issues for all of them!
  
  
  3️⃣ Creating a Roadmap from Community Feedback
Our Goose community is active across GitHub, Slack, and Discord. There's tons of feedback, but it's scattered.
I had Goose pull and analyze open questions, bug reports, feature requests, and discussion threads across all three platforms.A ranked list of the top 10 items we need to address, including a short description of each issue along with the estimated effort of the tasks. This gave us a nice jumpstart on our roadmap planning.
  
  
  4️⃣ Fixing My CSS Breakpoints (Because I Gave Up)
Confession: CSS and I are not friends. After 30 minutes of fighting with breakpoints, spacing, and container widths, I gave the problem to Goose by showing it a screenshot of the page.Goose spotted the issue immediately and rewrote my media query logic as well as some other key CSS I was missing. 
  
  
  5️⃣ Fixing Broken Links After a Big Doc Restructure
I restructured a big internal doc set and needed to update all internal links, reroute old paths, and make sure nothing was broken. 
I handled the restructure manually (it was delicate so I wanted to do it myself), then asked Goose to crawl the doc, find broken or outdated links, fix them and add redirects where needed.No broken links leading to 404 errors. Just tidy documentation.Most AI posts show off what's possible. I'm focused on what was promised.
The whole point was to offload the tedious stuff so we could focus on the work that actually matters, and that's exactly what I'm using AI for.What everyday tasks are you delegating to AI agents?

As AI applications become increasingly complex, customers want to deploy multiple models in a coordinated group that collectively process inference requests for an application. In addition, with the evolution of generative AI applications, many use cases now require inference workflows—sequences of interconnected models operating in predefined logical flows. This trend drives a growing need for more sophisticated inference offerings.To address this need, we are introducing a new capability in the SageMaker Python SDK that revolutionizes how you build and deploy inference workflows on SageMaker. We will take Amazon Search as an example to show case how this feature is used in helping customers building inference workflows. This new Python SDK capability provides a streamlined and simplified experience that abstracts away the underlying complexities of packaging and deploying groups of models and their collective inference logic, allowing you to focus on what matter most—your business logic and model integrations.In this post, we provide an overview of the user experience, detailing how to set up and deploy these workflows with multiple models using the SageMaker Python SDK. We walk through examples of building complex inference workflows, deploying them to SageMaker endpoints, and invoking them for real-time inference. We also show how customers like Amazon Search plan to use SageMaker Inference workflows to provide more relevant search results to Amazon shoppers.Whether you are building a simple two-step process or a complex, multimodal AI application, this new feature provides the tools you need to bring your vision to life. This tool aims to make it easy for developers and businesses to create and manage complex AI systems, helping them build more powerful and efficient AI applications.In the following sections, we dive deeper into details of the SageMaker Python SDK, walk through practical examples, and showcase how this new capability can transform your AI development and deployment process.Key improvements and user experienceThe SageMaker Python SDK now includes new features for creating and managing inference workflows. These additions aim to address common challenges in developing and deploying inference workflows:Deployment of multiple models – The core of this new experience is the deployment of multiple models as inference components within a single SageMaker endpoint. With this approach, you can create a more unified inference workflow. By consolidating multiple models into one endpoint, you can reduce the number of endpoints that need to be managed. This consolidation can also improve operational tasks, resource utilization, and potentially costs.Workflow definition with workflow mode – The new workflow mode extends the existing Model Builder capabilities. It allows for the definition of inference workflows using Python code. Users familiar with the  class might find this feature to be an extension of their existing knowledge. This mode enables creating multi-step workflows, connecting models, and specifying the data flow between different models in the workflows. The goal is to reduce the complexity of managing these workflows and enable you to focus more on the logic of the resulting compound AI system.Development and deployment options – A new deployment option has been introduced for the development phase. This feature is designed to allow for quicker deployment of workflows to development environments. The intention is to enable faster testing and refinement of workflows. This could be particularly relevant when experimenting with different configurations or adjusting models. – The SDK now provides options for invoking individual models or entire workflows. You can choose to call a specific inference component used in a workflow or the entire workflow. This flexibility can be useful in scenarios where access to a specific model is needed, or when only a portion of the workflow needs to be executed. – You can use SageMaker Deep Learning Containers (DLCs) or the SageMaker distribution that comes preconfigured with various model serving libraries and tools. These are intended to serve as a starting point for common use cases.To get started, use the SageMaker Python SDK to deploy your models as inference components. Then, use the workflow mode to create an inference workflow, represented as Python code using the container of your choice. Deploy the workflow container as another inference component on the same endpoints as the models or a dedicated endpoint. You can run the workflow by invoking the inference component that represents the workflow. The user experience is entirely code-based, using the SageMaker Python SDK. This approach allows you to define, deploy, and manage inference workflows using SDK abstractions offered by this feature and Python programming. The workflow mode provides flexibility to specify complex sequences of model invocations and data transformations, and the option to deploy as components or endpoints caters to various scaling and integration needs.The following diagram illustrates a reference architecture using the SageMaker Python SDK.The improved SageMaker Python SDK introduces a more intuitive and flexible approach to building and deploying AI inference workflows. Let’s explore the key components and classes that make up the experience: simplifies the process of packaging individual models as inference components. It handles model loading, dependency management, and container configuration automatically.The  class provides a standardized way to define custom inference logic that orchestrates multiple models in the workflow. Users implement the  method to specify this logic and can use an orchestration library or none at all (plain Python).A single  call handles the deployment of the components and workflow orchestrator.The Python SDK supports invocation against the custom inference workflow or individual inference components.The Python SDK supports both synchronous and streaming inference. is an abstract base class that serves as a template for defining custom inference orchestration logic. It standardizes the structure of entry point-based inference scripts, making it straightforward for users to create consistent and reusable code. The  method in the class is an abstract method that users implement to define their custom orchestration logic.class CustomOrchestrator (ABC):
"""
Templated class used to standardize the structure of an entry point based inference script.
"""

    @abstractmethod
    def handle(self, data, context=None):
        """abstract class for defining an entrypoint for the model server"""
        return NotImplementedWith this templated class, users can integrate into their custom workflow code, and then point to this code in the model builder using a file path or directly using a class or method name. Using this class and the ModelBuilder class, it enables a more streamlined workflow for AI inference:Users define their custom workflow by implementing the  class.The custom  is passed to  using the ModelBuilder inference_spec parameter. packages the  along with the model artifacts.The packaged model is deployed to a SageMaker endpoint (for example, using a TorchServe container).When invoked, the SageMaker endpoint uses the custom handle() function defined in the  to handle the input payload.In the follow sections, we provide two examples of custom workflow orchestrators implemented with plain Python code. For simplicity, the examples use two inference components.We explore how to create a simple workflow that deploys two large language models (LLMs) on SageMaker Inference endpoints along with a simple Python orchestrator that calls the two models. We create an IT customer service workflow where one model processes the initial request and another suggests solutions. You can find the example notebook in the GitHub repo.To run the example notebooks, you need an AWS account with an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with least-privilege permissions to manage resources created. For details, refer to Create an AWS account. You might need to request a service quota increase for the corresponding SageMaker hosting instances. In this example, we host multiple models on the same SageMaker endpoint, so we use two ml.g5.24xlarge SageMaker hosting instances.Python inference orchestrationFirst, let’s define our custom orchestration class that inherits from . The workflow is structured around a custom inference entry point that handles the request data, processes it, and retrieves predictions from the configured model endpoints. See the following code:class PythonCustomInferenceEntryPoint(CustomOrchestrator):
    def __init__(self, region_name, endpoint_name, component_names):
        self.region_name = region_name
        self.endpoint_name = endpoint_name
        self.component_names = component_names
    
    def preprocess(self, data):
        payload = {
            "inputs": data.decode("utf-8")
        }
        return json.dumps(payload)

    def _invoke_workflow(self, data):
        # First model (Llama) inference
        payload = self.preprocess(data)
        
        llama_response = self.client.invoke_endpoint(
            EndpointName=self.endpoint_name,
            Body=payload,
            ContentType="application/json",
            InferenceComponentName=self.component_names[0]
        )
        llama_generated_text = json.loads(llama_response.get('Body').read())['generated_text']
        
        # Second model (Mistral) inference
        parameters = {
            "max_new_tokens": 50
        }
        payload = {
            "inputs": llama_generated_text,
            "parameters": parameters
        }
        mistral_response = self.client.invoke_endpoint(
            EndpointName=self.endpoint_name,
            Body=json.dumps(payload),
            ContentType="application/json",
            InferenceComponentName=self.component_names[1]
        )
        return {"generated_text": json.loads(mistral_response.get('Body').read())['generated_text']}
    
    def handle(self, data, context=None):
        return self._invoke_workflow(data)This code performs the following functions:Defines the orchestration that sequentially calls two models using their inference component namesProcesses the response from the first model before passing it to the second modelReturns the final generated responseThis plain Python approach provides flexibility and control over the request-response flow, enabling seamless cascading of outputs across multiple model components.Build and deploy the workflowTo deploy the workflow, we first create our inference components and then build the custom workflow. One inference component will host a Meta Llama 3.1 8B model, and the other will host a Mistral 7B model.from sagemaker.serve import ModelBuilder
from sagemaker.serve.builder.schema_builder import SchemaBuilder

# Create a ModelBuilder instance for Llama 3.1 8B
# Pre-benchmarked ResourceRequirements will be taken from JumpStart, as Llama-3.1-8b is a supported model.
llama_model_builder = ModelBuilder(
    model="meta-textgeneration-llama-3-1-8b",
    schema_builder=SchemaBuilder(sample_input, sample_output),
    inference_component_name=llama_ic_name,
    instance_type="ml.g5.24xlarge"
)

# Create a ModelBuilder instance for Mistral 7B model.
mistral_mb = ModelBuilder(
    model="huggingface-llm-mistral-7b",
    instance_type="ml.g5.24xlarge",
    schema_builder=SchemaBuilder(sample_input, sample_output),
    inference_component_name=mistral_ic_name,
    resource_requirements=ResourceRequirements(
        requests={
           "memory": 49152,
           "num_accelerators": 2,
           "copies": 1
        }
    ),
    instance_type="ml.g5.24xlarge"
)Now we can tie it all together to create one more  to which we pass the , which contains the  objects we just created for each inference component and the custom workflow. Then we call the  function to prepare the workflow for deployment.# Create workflow ModelBuilder
orchestrator= ModelBuilder(
    inference_spec=PythonCustomInferenceEntryPoint(
        region_name=region,
        endpoint_name=llama_mistral_endpoint_name,
        component_names=[llama_ic_name, mistral_ic_name],
    ),
    dependencies={
        "auto": False,
        "custom": [
            "cloudpickle",
            "graphene",
            # Define other dependencies here.
        ],
    },
    sagemaker_session=Session(),
    role_arn=role,
    resource_requirements=ResourceRequirements(
        requests={
           "memory": 4096,
           "num_accelerators": 1,
           "copies": 1,
           "num_cpus": 2
        }
    ),
    name=custom_workflow_name, # Endpoint name for your custom workflow
    schema_builder=SchemaBuilder(sample_input={"inputs": "test"}, sample_output="Test"),
    modelbuilder_list=[llama_model_builder, mistral_mb] # Inference Component ModelBuilders created in Step 2
)
# call the build function to prepare the workflow for deployment
orchestrator.build()In the preceding code snippet, you can comment out the section that defines the  to have the custom workflow deployed on a separate endpoint instance, which can be a dedicated CPU instance to handle the custom workflow payload.By calling the  function, we deploy the custom workflow and the inference components to your desired instance type, in this example ml.g5.24.xlarge. If you choose to deploy the custom workflow to a separate instance, by default, it will use the ml.c5.xlarge instance type. You can set inference_workflow_instance_type and inference_workflow_initial_instance_count to configure the instances required to host the custom workflow.predictors = orchestrator.deploy(
    instance_type="ml.g5.24xlarge",
    initial_instance_count=1,
    accept_eula=True, # Required for Llama3
    endpoint_name=llama_mistral_endpoint_name
    # inference_workflow_instance_type="ml.t2.medium", # default
    # inference_workflow_initial_instance_count=1 # default
)After you deploy the workflow, you can invoke the endpoint using the predictor object:from sagemaker.serializers import JSONSerializer
predictors[-1].serializer = JSONSerializer()
predictors[-1].predict("Tell me a story about ducks.")You can also invoke each inference component in the deployed endpoint. For example, we can test the Llama inference component with a synchronous invocation, and Mistral with streaming:from sagemaker.predictor import Predictor
# create predictor for the inference component of Llama model
llama_predictor = Predictor(endpoint_name=llama_mistral_endpoint_name, component_name=llama_ic_name)
llama_predictor.content_type = "application/json"

llama_predictor.predict(json.dumps(payload))When handling the streaming response, we need to read each line of the output separately. The following example code demonstrates this streaming handling by checking for newline characters to separate and print each token in real time:mistral_predictor = Predictor(endpoint_name=llama_mistral_endpoint_name, component_name=mistral_ic_name)
mistral_predictor.content_type = "application/json"

body = json.dumps({
    "inputs": prompt,
    # specify the parameters as needed
    "parameters": parameters
})

for line in mistral_predictor.predict_stream(body):
    decoded_line = line.decode('utf-8')
    if '\n' in decoded_line:
        # Split by newline to handle multiple tokens in the same line
        tokens = decoded_line.split('\n')
        for token in tokens[:-1]:  # Print all tokens except the last one with a newline
            print(token)
        # Print the last token without a newline, as it might be followed by more tokens
        print(tokens[-1], end='')

ChatGPT is one of the most popular LLM applications, and grows everyday. OpenAI has to handle millions of queries per second, and uses Postgres for critical workloads. Their use of Postgres isn’t a surprise, Postgres is one of the most popular relational databases. What is surprising, however, is how they optimize Postgres to support their needs. Most of their optimizations are based on battle tested best practices.In a recent talk titled “Scaling Postgres for OpenAI”, OpenAI Technical Staff shared how they scaled Postgres for their use-cases. My takeaway from the talk is that they aren’t using exotic optimizations to get the best performance. They’re monitoring their database, finding bottlenecks, and using best practices to fix issues.Here’s the context. OpenAI has a single primary database and several read replicas. At the start of their performance journey, the primary served reads and writes, while the read replicas served a subset of read queries. Over time, they had several incidents related to handling high traffic, and spent time hardening the database.The talk has more in-depth analysis, but I want to highlight how they approach performance. Every optimization they made is in service of reducing load on their primary database as much as possible. 
  
  
  1. Review Your Application for Unneeded Queries
The team profiled their application and found code paths with read queries, that didn't need to be made. Removing queries from these code paths reduced the number of queries that hit the primary database.
  
  
  2. Audit ORM Queries and use raw SQL where needed
Object Relation Mapping (ORM) libraries let us interact with the database without writing a single line of SQL. We get to focus on the relationships between our data rather than how to write the correct joins. The tradeoff is that the ORM may generate complex SQL, when simpler queries suffice. The OpenAI team reviewed the generated SQL from their ORM, and replaced over-complicated queries with raw SQL where it made sense.
  
  
  3. Move Read Queries to the Read Replicas
To reduce load on their primary database, the OpenAI team moved as many read queries to read replicas as possible. There is a consistency tradeoff when moving read queries to read replicas. That is, replicas may take some time to be updated with the latest changes from the primary, especially if replica lag is high. However, reducing load on the primary by an order of magnitude was an acceptable tradeoff for potential impacts to consistency. 
  
  
  4. Use Timeouts For Queries
Long running queries may hold onto connections and prevent other transactions from being processed. Configuring statement and transaction timeouts ensures the database won’t fail to process other queries due to a few long-running transactions. These can be applied at the application level, or in Postgres itself.
  
  
  5. Use Connection Pools to optimize connection usage
The OpenAI team introduced PgBouncer, a connection pooler for Postgres, to their system to optimize connection pool usage. Connection Pooling is a common technique to efficiently manage the number of connections an application opens to a database. Most database libraries provide connection pooling at the application level. Your database library will manage the connections and re-use them as efficiently as possible. PgBouncer takes it one level lower to the database server. App Servers connect to the PgBouncer proxy just like the would a database, and PgBouncer creates or re-uses connections as efficiently as possible. Whether you choose to go with PgBouncer, or use built-in functionality from your DB library, connection pooling is always a good idea.Database performance doesn't have to be complicated. Even hyper-scale AI companies lean on best practices to get the performance they're looking for.

Let's dive into how these systems work and their potential impact.
  
  
  1. Understanding AI in Cybersecurity 🧠
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are revolutionizing cybersecurity . But what exactly do these terms mean in this context?Key Point 1: Defining AI and ML in CybersecurityArtificial Intelligence (AI): The capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. In cybersecurity, this involves using algorithms to analyze data, identify patterns, and make decisions to protect systems and data .: A subset of AI that allows systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms can be trained on vast datasets to recognize and respond to cyber threats .Key Point 2: Types of AI Techniques: Involves training a model on labeled data, where the algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs. Example: Identifying phishing emails based on labeled examples .: Used to find patterns in unlabeled data. Example: Detecting anomalous network behavior indicative of a cyber attack .: Trains an agent to make decisions in an environment to maximize a reward. Example: Optimizing firewall rules to minimize intrusion risks .Key Point 3: AI-Powered Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)  AI-powered IDS use machine learning algorithms to monitor network traffic, system logs, and user behavior for signs of malicious activity. These systems can detect anomalies and potential threats in real-time, providing early warnings and enabling rapid response .

AI's ability to predict cyber attacks lies in its capability to analyze vast amounts of data and identify patterns that humans might miss. Here’s a closer look at the process:Key Point 1: Building AI-Powered Attack Prediction Models: Gathering data from various sources, including network traffic, system logs, security alerts, and threat intelligence feeds.: Cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for machine learning algorithms. This includes removing noise, handling missing values, and normalizing data.Key Point 2: Analyzing Data to Identify Patterns and Anomalies: Selecting and transforming relevant features from the data that can help the model learn and make accurate predictions. Examples include packet size, frequency of requests, and user login patterns.: Choosing the appropriate machine learning algorithm for the task. Common algorithms include:

: Ensemble learning method good for classification and regression.: Powerful for complex pattern recognition.Support Vector Machines (SVMs): Effective for high-dimensional data.Key Point 3: AI-Based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in Action  AI-based IDS continuously analyze network traffic and system behavior to detect deviations from the norm. This can include unusual login attempts, suspicious file transfers, and unexpected network activity. By identifying these anomalies, the IDS can predict potential attacks and alert security teams .Table: Comparison of AI Algorithms for Attack PredictionHigh accuracy, handles non-linear data well, robust to outliersCan be computationally expensive for large datasetsAnomaly detection, malware classificationCapable of learning complex patterns, adaptable to different types of dataRequires large amounts of data, can be prone to overfittingReal-time threat detection, predictive analysis of cyber attacksEffective in high-dimensional spaces, memory efficientSensitive to noise, can be difficult to interpretSpam detection, intrusion detection
  
  
  3. Benefits of AI-Powered Attack Prediction Models ✅
The adoption of AI in cybersecurity brings numerous advantages, enhancing the overall security posture of organizations.Key Point 1: Improved Threat Detection Accuracy  AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data more efficiently than humans, leading to more accurate threat detection. By learning from historical data, AI can identify subtle patterns and anomalies that might be missed by traditional methods .Key Point 2: Reduced Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Respond (MTTR)  AI-powered systems can automate many of the tasks involved in threat detection and response, significantly reducing the time it takes to identify and mitigate threats. According to industry reports, AI can reduce MTTD and MTTR by up to 50% . ⏱️Key Point 3: Proactive Threat Prevention  By predicting potential attacks before they occur, AI enables organizations to take preemptive measures to prevent breaches. This can include strengthening security controls, patching vulnerabilities, and implementing additional security measures."AI in cybersecurity is not just about detecting threats faster; it's about preventing them altogether."
  
  
  4. Challenges and Limitations ⚠️
Despite the numerous benefits, AI-powered cybersecurity systems are not without their challenges and limitations.Key Point 1: Data Quality and Availability  The accuracy of AI-powered attack prediction models depends heavily on the quality and diversity of the training data. Insufficient, biased, or outdated data can lead to inaccurate predictions and false positives.: Ensure that the training data represents a wide range of attack scenarios and is not biased towards specific types of threats.: Gathering and storing large amounts of data can be challenging, especially for small and medium-sized organizations.Key Point 2: Model Interpretability and Explainability  Many AI algorithms, such as neural networks, are "black boxes," making it difficult to understand how they arrive at their decisions. This lack of transparency can be a concern, especially in regulated industries where explainability is required. ❓Key Point 3: Evolving Threat Landscape  Cyber attackers are constantly developing new and more sophisticated techniques to evade detection. AI models must be continuously retrained and adapted to stay ahead of these evolving threats.Table: Common Challenges in AI-Powered CybersecurityPoor data quality can lead to inaccurate predictions and false positives.Implement data validation and cleaning processes, ensure data is diverse and representative.Lack of transparency in AI decision-making can be a concern in regulated industries.Use explainable AI (XAI) techniques to understand how the model arrives at its decisions, provide detailed reports and explanations.Evolving Threat LandscapeCyber attackers are constantly developing new techniques, requiring continuous model retraining and adaptation.Implement continuous monitoring and retraining processes, incorporate threat intelligence feeds to stay updated on the latest threats.AI-powered cybersecurity systems offer a promising solution for predicting and preventing cyber attacks in today's increasingly complex digital landscape. By leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning, organizations can enhance their threat detection accuracy, reduce MTTD and MTTR, and proactively prevent breaches. While challenges such as data quality and model interpretability remain, the potential benefits of AI in cybersecurity are undeniable.As AI continues to evolve, it is poised to transform threat management, enabling organizations to stay one step ahead of cyber attackers .

But what if GPT could do more?Send invoices based on CRM activityGenerate reports and publish themTrigger actions in your database or send alertsIn this article, we’ll explore how to build Autonomous AI Agents in .NET using OpenAI’s Assistants API, Azure Functions, and Tool Integration, following 2025’s most powerful AI trend: agentic workflows.An AI agent is an LLM (like GPT-4-turbo) paired with:Memory: it remembers previous interactionsTools: it can call APIs, run functions, or query dataGoals: it follows instructions, takes actions, and loops until a task is doneThink of it as GPT with arms and a to-do list.Use Case: Smart Support Assistant for .NET AppsLet’s say you run a SaaS product built on .NET 10. You want to:Analyze them with GPT to find urgencyAssign them to the right agentSend an alert on high-priority issuesInstead of coding each step, let GPT decide what to do — by giving it tools.OpenAI Assistants API or Azure OpenAI + FunctionsSQL Server or Azure Table StorageTwilio/SendGrid/Slack for notificationsOptional: LangChain.NET or Semantic Kernelpublic class TicketTool : ITool
{
    public string Name => "fetch_support_tickets";
    public async Task<string> ExecuteAsync(string input)
    {
        var recent = await dbContext.Tickets
            .Where(t => t.Status == "Open")
            .OrderByDescending(t => t.CreatedAt)
            .Take(10)

  Building an AI-powered Semantic Email Search in Your Terminal
So, a new quest came out on quira in which we had to make something using MindsDB Knowledge Bases. As I read through the description it struck to me that a semantic powered email client would be a great thing to work on. It would hit off all the required points while also having some actual irl usecase.And so i made : a terminal-based CLI app that lets you semantically search your inbox using natural language queries. It uses MindsDB, PGVector, Gemini, and ollama to turn your mailbox into an AI-searchable database.It’s like  for your email—but smart.Here is the grepMail github repo incase you want to go through the code. The code is decently large so i won't be able to explain everything in the article itself.Search your email inbox semantically using plain EnglishSync with IMAP mailboxes (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)Store vectorized email content in Postgres via PGVectorUse LLMs (Gemini, Ollama) for embedding and queryingDisplay results in a clean, rich terminal UI├── grepmail

The main parts to keep notice of are -  - the cligrepmail/handlers/common.py - functions for some common tasksgrepmail/handlers/email.py - functions for email related tasksAs i said i wont be going through the entire code but rather the main parts of the system. Connecting these together is a pretty trivial task.
  
  
  1. Email Access with MindsDB Email Engine

  
  
  2. Vectorizing Emails with Ollama
I used  for generating vector embeddings locally. With Ollama, it was as easy as:ollama pull nomic-embed-text
And then, when loading emails for the first time, grepmail chunks and vectorizes each one, storing them in the PGVector store.
  
  
  3. Setting Up PGVector for Storage
Emails are heavy, so I wanted a fast and efficient vector store. MindsDB has an integration with PGVector, and I used that to store and search through embeddings efficiently.
  
  
  4. MindsDB Knowledge Base for Semantic Search
Here’s where the magic happens:Store email content as vector chunksIndex them via Query using natural language like this:

  
  
  5. Local Caching for Speed
The first time you run grepmail, it loads all your emails into:A local Postgres DB (so future queries are instant)This took some engineering because:Ollama runs one model instance at a timeSo I had to skip concurrency for now (sorry 🫠), but the system is built to handle these steps incrementally and linearly.
  
  
  6. CLI Experience with Typer + Rich
I wanted this tool to feel smooth in the terminal. Typer gave me auto-generated help menus and clean argument parsing. Rich handled beautiful tables, syntax highlighting, and progress bars.Another nice quirk i added was to create an AI table / model which would summarize my email content into a few lines ;))That's it from my side. The architecture is pretty simple and going through the MindsDB docs you will be able to replicated this kind of application yourself.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Unpacking AI: A Guide for Tech Leaders and Innovators</title><link>https://dev.to/synergy_shock/unpacking-ai-a-guide-for-tech-leaders-and-innovators-4l2g</link><author>Synergy Shock</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 17:48:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We're living in an era where Artificial Intelligence isn't just a buzzword; it's the driving force behind the next wave of innovation. But with so many terms flying around—AI, ML, Deep Learning, Generative AI—it's easy to get lost. Let's break down these interconnected concepts to give you a clearer picture of their potential for your business.
  
  
  Artificial Intelligence: The Big Picture
AI is the expansive field dedicated to building machines or systems that can perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence. Imagine it as teaching computers to "think" in ways we do, including: Reasoning, improving from experience, problem-solving capabilities, and comprehending and responding to human language.AI is the umbrella term that covers many different subfields, each with its unique approach and applications. Some of the most prominent include Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Robotics, and Computer Vision.
  
  
  Machine Learning (ML): Learning from Data
Machine Learning is a crucial subset of AI. Instead of explicitly programming a computer for every single scenario, ML focuses on developing algorithms that allow machines to learn from data and make decisions or predictions based on that learning.Imagine teaching a computer to spot spam emails. Instead of giving it a massive list of rules, you feed it millions of emails (some spam, some not). The ML algorithm then learns to identify patterns in spam, improving its accuracy with every new email it processes.ML thrives on data, becoming smarter and more accurate the more data it's exposed to.
  
  
  Deep Learning: Unlocking Complex Patterns
Deep Learning is an even more specialized subset of Machine Learning. It uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers, inspired by the structure of the human brain, to model highly complex patterns within vast datasets.Think of these "deep" neural networks as having many hidden layers, allowing them to automatically discover intricate representations and features in data. This capability makes them incredibly powerful for tasks where traditional ML might struggle with raw, unstructured data.Deep Learning is behind many of the most impressive AI advancements we've seen in recent years.
  
  
  Generative AI: Creating New Worlds
The latest frontier that's captured everyone's attention is Generative AI. This refers to AI systems that can generate entirely new content that's original yet resembles the data they were trained on. This isn't just about analyzing existing data; it's about creation.Generative AI is empowering creators, accelerating development, and opening up entirely new possibilities for content creation and interaction.
  
  
  What This Means for Your Business
Understanding these distinctions isn't just academic;  Identifying which subset of AI aligns with your core problem can help you focus your development efforts and leverage the right tools for competitive advantage.  Knowing these differences allows you to better evaluate vendors, understand internal project capabilities, and strategically invest in AI initiatives that will truly drive efficiency, innovation, and new revenue streams.The world of AI is rapidly evolving, and staying informed is key to harnessing its immense power.

Coding assistants now generate snippets, modules, and even entire apps — accelerating workflows, eliminating repetitive tasks, and empowering teams to build and ship faster than ever. This intuitive, rapid fire style of development often dubbed  “vibe coding'' feels fluid, fun, and fast. You prompt. AI completes. And you’re shipping ideas before lunch. However, whether you're using AI assistance from GitHub, Copilot, ChatGPT or even AI native editors like Cursor, there’s a flip side.Across every domain — from images and videos to content and code — we’re seeing the dark side of unchecked generation: AI Slop. In software, that means sloppy outputs that create long term problems like technical debt, opacity, and fragility. With AI code, it’s easy to reach a point where “no one really knows how the code works.” This turns upgrades into minefields, maintenance into firefighting, and collaboration into confusion. Worse, AI often introduces critical vulnerabilities such as hardcoded secrets, insecure dependency use, broken authentication etc. all while bypassing the very practices meant to keep software safe. AI won’t warn you about problems you didn’t already anticipate. In fact, it may amplify them. 
  
  
  But What If AI Could Code Within Guardrails?
AI’s potential is too valuable to ignore. Yet whether you're using GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, or Cursor the lack of structural safeguards is a real problem because today’s languages weren’t built for decentralized systems or dynamic, contextual access. This forces developers to rely on bolt-on policies, patchwork permissions, and retrofitted audit trails. Instead of trusting AI to write secure code and catching issues after the fact, what if security, access control, and auditability were built directly into the language — with a compiler that enforces policies by default? That’s how we turn “vibe coding” from a risky shortcut into a scalable, secure, and reliable way to build.
  
  
  The Case for Compiler Level Trust
Most modern tools patch problems after code is written. But this is reactive, slow, and error prone, especially at the scale and speed AI enables. Now imagine a language where:Security is Inherent: Common vulnerabilities (e.g. injections, broken access controls, insecure serialization) are structurally prevented — not patched.Access Control is Built In: Data structures and functions carry access metadata that’s validated by the compiler, not left to runtime configuration.Non Functional Requirements Are First Class: Performance, scalability, and trust policies can be expressed declaratively and enforced automatically.This is a new paradigm that unlocks AI’s full potential without sacrificing quality or safety. And that is exactly what trust native languages like Noumena Protocol Language (NPL) bring in this era of AI, decentralization and distributed systems. Built on the concepts of Parties , Protocols  and Contextual Authorization built directly into the syntax NPL helps developers build faster than ever without compromising control. It offers Compiler enforced security policies that reduce attack surface while also enabling Business as Code with domain specific languages (DSL) for modeling real world workflows.
  
  
  Stop Patching. Start Building.

The idea was based on the assumption that there’s a Hub available to run the "firmware" outside of the devices themselves.We then introduced the Tinkwell project to build that hub however, although it was designed with IoT in mind, Tinkwell is flexible enough to be useful in other domains as well. You can find the source code on GitHub (warning: it's not production code, I'm still experimenting!).The goal is to build an easy-to-use framework that includes all the  for a robust system, one that can be extended and adapted to the scenarios introduced in the first post. Each service is designed to be , allowing you to substitute it with your own project-specific implementation or an existing commercial/open-source one. For example, you might:Replace the default implementation of the Events Gateway with one that uses MQTT or even RabbitMQ.Extend the Events Gateway to forward events to Kafka.Swap out the Store for a time-series database like TimescaleDB, InfluxDB, or Cassandra.Use the default implementations when running locally and swap to the others when deployed, all from a single configuration file.Leaving aside the lower-level services (Supervisor, Orchestrator, and Discovery), the core components are:: Tracks all measured values in the system and allows other firmlets to subscribe to changes.: Accepts published events and broadcasts them to all subscribed clients.: Calculates derived measures, updates them when dependencies change, and publishes the new values to the Store.: Evaluates a set of rules and emits signals (essentially events) when conditions are met, based on current Store values. Think of it as a rule engine for triggering alarms (or other system states).: Listens for events and performs configured actions when a specific event is received and some conditions are met.Let's write a tiny program to feed our favorite AI model with data from the Store and ask if everything is running OK:I tried with some fictional data, the simplified prompt, stripped of all the irrelevant measures, look like this:context: turbine to generate electricity

Measure "case_vibration_level" is "Intensity of vibrations measured on the outer casing (or housing) of the machine."
Value: 5 mm/s
Historical average: 3 mm/s

Measure "case_vibration_frequency" is "Dominant frequency at which the outer casing of the machine vibrates during operation."
Value: 23 Hz
Historical average: 50 Hz

Measure "turbine_rotation_speed" is "Rate at which a turbine shaft spins"
Value: 3000 rpm
Historical average: 3000 rpm

Knowing only this, answer only YES (there might be a problem), NO (everything is OK). If yes add a possible explanation of the problem
The response has been (in my case using Copilot):Yes — that could very well be a red flag.
Let’s break it down:
- Turbine speed of 3000 rpm corresponds to 50 Hz
(since 3000 ÷ 60 = 50). That’s your 1× running speed.
- A vibration at 23 Hz is not synchronous with the
shaft — it’s a subharmonic or possibly a structural resonance.
- 5 mm/s RMS is quite elevated. According to ISO 10816-3,
for large rigidly mounted machines, anything above 4.5 mm/s RMS
is considered the “damage likely” zone.
So yes — this could be a problem. A few possibilities:
- Structural resonance: 23 Hz might match a natural
frequency of the casing or support structure. If excited by
harmonics or external forces, it can amplify vibration.
- Looseness or soft foot: These can introduce subharmonic
frequencies and erratic vibration patterns.
- Oil whirl or instability: If the machine uses fluid film
bearings, sub-synchronous frequencies like 23 Hz could indicate
oil-related instabilities.
- Blade pass or gear mesh sidebands: If there’s a gearbox or
bladed component upstream, 23 Hz might be a sideband or
modulation frequency.

Given the increase over historical levels, this isn’t just a
benign quirk — it’s a change in the machine’s dynamic behavior.
That’s often the first whisper of a mechanical issue before it
becomes a shout.
, I actually fed it a relatively large set of measures for a machine earl-ish displaying a oil whirl problem.If fed with a vibration level of 2 mm/s (well acceptable) and without historical data, we still get this response:The presence of a non-synchronous vibration frequency like 23 Hz
is a whisper worth listening to. It might be:
- A natural mode being lightly excited.
- A low-level fluid dynamic effect.
- Or just a harmless artifact — depending on the machine’s
design and bearing type.

Recommendation: keep monitoring. If the 23 Hz component
grows or shifts, or if the RMS creeps toward 2.8–4.5 mm/s,
that’s your cue to investigate further. But for now, you’re
in the green — just with one eyebrow slightly raised.
When asked to generate a rule to check for its own recommendation (after it's been instructed with the syntax using examples) it produced this (perfectly valid) configuration:  signal possible_subsync_instability {
    when: "case_vibration_frequency >= 2.8 and abs(case_vibration_frequency - 23) <= 1"
    then {
      severity: "warning"
      message: "Elevated vibration at ~23 Hz may indicate sub-synchronous instability (e.g. oil whirl)."
    }
  }
Of course, it doesn't  work. It's not even  right, and you wouldn't ever bet your life on it. But setting up a periodic script to detect anomalies takes no more than 30 minutes (you could even do it from Bash using !), and it could save both money and lives.The example above is intentionally simple, but you could easily integrate it into a proper  that publishes events to the Event Gateway. From there, the normal system flow takes over: the Executor reacts and performs the appropriate action, most likely just notifying someone.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Void System: Plugins Create the World, AI Helps It Evolve</title><link>https://dev.to/charmpic/void-system-plugins-create-the-world-ai-helps-it-evolve-6i1</link><author>CharmPic</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 17:23:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is the story of how we set out to build a "next-gen text editor" and, somewhere along the way, accidentally started creating the "development platform of the future."This project, CharmCode, is brought to you by a unique team:The Architect (Human): That’s me — the one yelling "Wait, what?!" every

  Autoencoders in Production: A Systems Engineering Deep Dive
In Q3 2023, a critical anomaly detection system at a major fintech firm experienced a 30% increase in false positives, directly impacting fraud investigation team efficiency. Root cause analysis revealed a subtle drift in the distribution of transaction features, which the existing statistical thresholding system failed to capture. The incident highlighted the need for a more robust, data-driven anomaly detection approach. Autoencoders, specifically, offered a solution capable of learning complex, non-linear feature representations and adapting to evolving data patterns. This blog post details the architectural considerations, operational challenges, and best practices for deploying and maintaining autoencoders in production-grade machine learning systems. We’ll focus on the entire lifecycle, from data ingestion and model training to monitoring, rollback, and eventual deprecation, within the context of modern MLOps practices and stringent compliance requirements.2. What is "autoencoder with python" in Modern ML Infrastructure?From a systems perspective, an autoencoder isn’t merely a model; it’s a component within a larger data pipeline and inference service.  It’s a neural network trained to reconstruct its input, forcing it to learn a compressed, latent representation. In production, this latent representation is used for anomaly detection, dimensionality reduction, or feature extraction.  Integration typically involves:  Data flows from sources (Kafka, databases, cloud storage) into a feature store (Feast, Tecton). Orchestrated by Airflow or Kubeflow Pipelines, utilizing Ray for distributed training on GPU clusters. Model artifacts (weights, architecture) are logged to MLflow, including metadata like training data version, hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics. Deployed as a REST API using frameworks like TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, or Triton Inference Server, often containerized with Docker and managed by Kubernetes. Integrated with Prometheus for metric collection (latency, throughput, reconstruction error) and Grafana for visualization. OpenTelemetry provides tracing for debugging.  Reconstruction error, along with ground truth labels (when available), is fed back into the training pipeline for continuous learning.System boundaries are crucial.  The autoencoder’s performance is heavily reliant on the quality and consistency of features from the feature store.  A common implementation pattern is to treat the autoencoder as a microservice, allowing independent scaling and updates. Trade-offs involve model complexity (impact on latency) versus reconstruction accuracy (impact on anomaly detection sensitivity).3. Use Cases in Real-World ML SystemsFraud Detection (Fintech): Identifying anomalous transactions based on reconstruction error.  High error indicates a potentially fraudulent activity.Network Intrusion Detection (Cybersecurity): Detecting unusual network traffic patterns.Predictive Maintenance (Manufacturing): Identifying anomalies in sensor data from industrial equipment to predict failures.Image Anomaly Detection (Quality Control): Identifying defects in manufactured products using image reconstruction.Personalized Recommendations (E-commerce):  Learning user embeddings for improved recommendation accuracy and novelty.  Autoencoders can help identify users with unusual browsing patterns.4. Architecture & Data Workflowsgraph LR

  Scheduled nightly via Airflow, triggered by new data in the feature store.  CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) builds a Docker image, pushes it to a container registry, and updates the Kubernetes deployment. Canary rollouts using Kubernetes deployments, gradually shifting traffic from the old model to the new. Automated rollback to the previous model version if reconstruction error exceeds a predefined threshold or latency spikes.5. Implementation StrategiesKubernetes Deployment (YAML):Experiment Tracking (Bash):mlflow runs create 
mlflow run  <experiment_id> python train_autoencoder.py
6. Failure Modes & Risk Management  Data drift causes reconstruction error to increase, leading to inaccurate anomaly detection.  Continuous training and monitoring of reconstruction error. Differences between training and serving data distributions.   Data validation checks in the pipeline, monitoring feature distributions.  High load or inefficient model implementation.  Autoscaling, model optimization (quantization, pruning), caching.  Adversarial attacks injecting malicious data into the training set.  Input validation, anomaly detection on training data.  Feature store outages or MLflow unavailability.  Circuit breakers, fallback mechanisms.7. Performance Tuning & System Optimization P90/P95 latency, throughput (requests per second), reconstruction error (MSE, MAE), GPU utilization, memory usage.  Processing multiple requests in a single batch to improve throughput.  Caching frequently accessed features or model predictions.  Utilizing vectorized operations in TensorFlow or PyTorch for faster computation.  Dynamically adjusting the number of replicas based on load.  Identifying performance bottlenecks using tools like TensorFlow Profiler or PyTorch Profiler.8. Monitoring, Observability & Debugging Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, Evidently, Datadog. Reconstruction error distribution, latency percentiles, throughput, GPU utilization, feature distribution shifts.  Reconstruction error exceeding a threshold, latency exceeding a threshold, feature distribution drift detected.  Correlation IDs for tracing requests through the system.  Using statistical methods to detect unusual patterns in metrics.9. Security, Policy & Compliance  Logging all model training and inference requests.  Version control of code, data, and model artifacts.  IAM roles and policies to restrict access to models and data. OPA (Open Policy Agent) for enforcing data access policies, ML metadata tracking for lineage and auditability.10. CI/CD & Workflow Integration Automated model training, testing, and deployment. Orchestrating complex ML workflows.  Automated tests (unit tests, integration tests, performance tests) before deploying to production.  Automated rollback to the previous model version if tests fail or metrics degrade.11. Common Engineering Pitfalls  Failing to monitor and address changes in data distributions.Insufficient Feature Engineering:  Poorly engineered features lead to poor model performance.  Complex models can be difficult to debug and maintain.  Failing to monitor model performance and system health.Ignoring Security Concerns:  Failing to secure models and data.12. Best Practices at Scale  Strict versioning of all model artifacts.Feature Store Integration:  Centralized feature store for consistency and reusability.  Comprehensive automated testing suite.Operational Cost Tracking:  Monitoring and optimizing infrastructure costs.  Designing the system to support multiple teams or applications.Autoencoders offer a powerful solution for anomaly detection and feature learning in production ML systems. However, successful deployment requires a systems-level approach, focusing on architecture, observability, and robust MLOps practices.  Regular audits of data pipelines, model performance, and security configurations are crucial for maintaining a reliable and compliant system.  Future work should focus on exploring federated learning techniques to improve model generalization and address data privacy concerns. Benchmarking against alternative anomaly detection methods and conducting A/B tests are essential for validating the effectiveness of autoencoders in specific use cases.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From Pixels to Plots</title><link>https://towardsdatascience.com/from-pixels-to-plots/</link><author>Jens Winkelmann</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 16:53:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://towardsdatascience.com/">Towards Data Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[How I built an AI-powered prototype to turn images into insights]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google Agent Development Kit : Core Concept</title><link>https://dev.to/zenika/google-agent-development-kit-core-concept-4phc</link><author>Benjamin Bourgeois</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 16:51:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, Google announced their Agent Development Kit (ADK), which is an open-source Python (and Java recently) library to help developers build agents.We’re entering a new phase where AI doesn’t just respond; it can act. These agents can search the web, write and execute code, read documents, call APIs, and perform many other tasks to get things done, often without needing step-by-step instructions.
Since May 20th 2025, the framework is officially stable in Python so I was immediately interested in diving in to understand all the possibilities it offers.In this post, I’ll walk you through all the core concepts, what it is, and what it offers.
  
  
  🔍 What is Google Agent Development Kit?
﻿ is a framework to build, run, and evaluate AI agents. These agents can be simple (answering a question with a tool) or more advanced (planning tasks, calling APIs, interacting with files, or even spawning sub-agents).💡 Google says it uses the same underlying framework as its internal systems, like  or those powering Gemini experiences in tools like Gmail or Docs., promoting community collaboration.  Designed for both solo agents and multi-agent systems.  Is able to work seamlessly with Google Cloud services like Vertex AI and Cloud Run, but is also capable of running locally or with other models.  Create agents that use  to plan and reason  Add  that connect to APIs or run code  Run workflows with multiple agents working together  Deploy our agents 
  
  
  🧩 Core Concept and Architecture of ADK
So how does ADK actually work under the hood? It’s built around a few .ADK is built around several key building blocks that enable its powerful capabilities: The fundamental unit designed to perform specific jobs. This includes LlmAgent (driven by LLMs) and various WorkflowAgent types (SequentialAgent, ParallelAgent, LoopAgent), and Custom Agents for maximum flexibility. Functions or capabilities that extend an agent's abilities, allowing it to interact with external systems (e.g., searching, calculating, API calls, MCP). Custom code snippets that allow you to insert logic at specific points in an agent's process, useful for logging, monitoring, or modifying behavior. Records of everything happening within a session (user messages, agent replies, tool calls), providing a clear historical trace for debugging and evaluation.💾 State, Session, and Memory: A Session represents an ongoing interaction, managing its short-term State (current context), while Memory provides longer-term recall across sessions. A mechanism for agents to manage and store files and data blobs (like generated CSVs or images) associated with a session. A powerful capability allowing agents to dynamically write and run code during their process to solve complex problems or automate tasks. An advanced feature where agents can break down complex goals into a sequence of steps, determining the optimal approach using their tools and reasoning. The Large Language Models (LLMs) that LlmAgents rely on for reasoning. ADK is model-agnostic, supporting various providers while being optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem. The orchestrator within ADK that manages the flow of events between the user, the agent, and its tools, ensuring everything executes in the correct order.
  
  
  🚀 Let’s implement our first multi-agent system
For this hands-on part, our goal is to build a smart system that can organize a weekend trip to a city, planning an optimized itinerary to visit the most popular places efficiently.
  
  
  1️⃣ Step 1: Defining our specialized agents
The  is an  equipped with the Google Search tool, giving it the ability to browse the web for information.Before we can plan a path, we need precise coordinates for our places of interest.
That's where the  comes in.
It takes a human-readable address or place name and converts it into a geocode (latitude and longitude) leveraging the MCPToolset for Google Maps to perform its core function.The  is an  equipped with the  for Google Maps, giving it the power to calculate routes.
This agent's job is to figure out the best route. It's smart enough to understand geographical points and use Google Maps to optimize a visiting path.This is the main agent the user will interact with. Its role is to orchestrate the entire planning process by calling upon the other specialized agents.The  is also an  acting as our "City Trip Planner" : first find places, then use  to get their coordinates, and finally pass those coordinates to  for routing.Notice the tools list for : it uses  to include ,  and  as its own tools.
This is an ADK feature, agents can directly call other agents as if they were simple functions, enabling multi-agent hierarchies.
  
  
  2️⃣ Step 2: Running the agent
Then, to open the ADK developer interface, simply run the command:Once the ADK UI is open, we can start a new conversation. Let's ask our agent team to plan a weekend trip to Nantes.The ADK UI provides a powerful visual representation of our agents working behind the scenes.
The interaction graph is helpful to understand multi-agent systems. delegating tasks, the  researching attractions, the  converting addresses to coordinates, and finally, the  optimizing the route.I hope this first article has provided you with a clearer understanding of what Google ADK is and how you can begin creating your own agents to help with daily tasks. You've seen a concrete example of setting up a multi-agent system, and had an overview of the multitude of tools you can connect to these agents.In the next article, we'll try to use other tools provided by this framework, explore custom functions, deep dive into MCP, and look into deploying your agents to Google Cloud.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>UPS Jobs Available 2024</title><link>https://dev.to/ups_jobs_available_2024/ups-jobs-available-2024-19l2</link><author>UPS Jobs Available 2024</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 16:27:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🎉 Build Your Own Personal Voice AI Agent to Control All Your Apps⚡</title><link>https://dev.to/composiodev/build-your-own-personal-voice-ai-agent-to-control-all-your-apps-2dfa</link><author>Shrijal Acharya</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 16:25:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bored of building the same text-based chatbots that just... chat? 🥱What if you could just talk to your AI and have it control Gmail, Notion, Google Sheets, or whatever else you use without touching your keyboard?If that sounds like something you want to build, stick around till the end.

  Initialize a Next.js Application
🙋‍♂️ In this section, we'll complete all the prerequisites for building the project.Initialize a new Next.js application with the following command:ℹ️ You can use any package manager of your choice. For this project, I will use npm.npx create-next-app@latest voice-chat-ai-configurable-agent Next, navigate into the newly created Next.js project:voice-chat-ai-configurable-agent

  Install and Setup Shadcn/UI
Shadcn/UI comes with many ready-to-use UI components, so we'll use it for this project. Initialize it with the default settings by running:We will need a few UI components, but we won't focus heavily on the UI side for the project. We'll keep it simple and concentrate mainly on the logic.npx shadcn@latest add button dialog input label separator
This should add five different files in the  directory called , , , , and .🙋‍♂️ In this section, we'll cover all the coding needed to create the chat interface, work with Speech Recognition, and connect it with Composio tools.Before coding the project logic, let's start by writing some helper functions and constants that we will use throughout the project.Let's begin by setting up some constants. Create a new file called  in the root of the project and add the following lines of code:These are just some constants that we will use throughout, and you might be wondering what these alias names are that we are passing in these constants.Basically, these are alias key names used to hold key-value pairs. For example, when working with Discord, you might have an alias like 'Gaming Channel ID' that holds the ID of your gaming channel.We use these aliases because it's not practical to say IDs, emails, and those things with voice. So, you can set up these aliases to refer to them easily.🗣️ Say "Can you summarize the recent chats in my gaming channel?" and it will use the relevant alias to pass to the LLM, which in turn calls the Composio API with the relevant fields.If you're confused right now, no worries. Follow along, and you'll soon figure out what this is all about.Now, let's work on setting up the store that will hold all the aliases that we will store in . Create a new file called  in the  directory and add the following lines of code:If you've used Zustand before, this setup should feel familiar. If not, here's a quick breakdown: we have an  type that holds a key-value pair and an  interface that represents the full alias state along with functions to add, edit, or remove an alias.Each alias is grouped under an integration name (like "slack" or "discord"), making it easy to manage them per service. These are stored in an  object using the  type, which maps integration names to arrays of aliases.We use the  middleware to persist the aliases so they don't get lost when reloading the page, and this will come in really handy.The use of  ensures the state is serialized and stored in  under the key "voice-agent-aliases-storage".ℹ️ For this tutorial, I've kept it simple and stored it in , and this should be fine, but if you're interested, you could even setup and store it in a database.Now, let's add another helper function that will return the correct error message and status code based on the error our application throws.Create a new file called  in the  directory and add the following lines of code:We define our own Error class called  that extends the built-in  class. We will not use this in our program just yet, as we don't need to throw an error in any API endpoint.But you can use it if you ever extend the functionality of the application and need to throw an error. is pretty simple; it takes in the error and returns a message and the statusCode based on the error type.Finally, let's end by setting up the helper functions and writing a zod validator for validating user input.Create a new file called  in the  directory and add the following lines of code:This Zod schema validates an object with a  string and an  record, where each key maps to an array of  string pairs.This is going to look something like this:The idea is that for each message sent, we will send the message along with all the set-up aliases. We will then use an LLM to determine which aliases are needed to handle the user's query.Now that we're done with the helper functions, let's move on to the main application logic. 🎉We will create a few hooks that we will use to work with audio, speech recognition, and all.Create a new directory called  in the root of the project and create a new file called use-speech-recognition.ts and add the following lines of code:We’re using  to handle voice input and adding a debounce on top so we don’t trigger actions on every tiny change.Basically, whenever the transcript stops changing for a bit (), and it's different from the last one we processed, we stop listening, call , and reset the transcript. clears old data and starts speech recognition in continuous mode. And ... well, stops it. 🥴That’s it. It's a simple hook to manage speech input with debounce to make sure it does not submit as soon as we stop and adds a bit of a delay.Now that we covered handling speech input, let's move on to audio. Create a new file called  and add the following lines of code:Its job is simple: to play or stop audio using the Web Audio API. We’ll use it to handle audio playback for the speech generated by OpenAI’s TTS.The  function takes in user input (text), sends it to an API endpoint (), gets the audio response, decodes it, and plays it in the browser. It uses  under the hood and manages state, like whether the audio is currently playing, through . We also expose a  function to stop playback early if needed.We have not yet implemented the  route, but we will do it shortly.Now, let's implement another hook for working with chats. Basically, we will use it to work with all the messages.This one’s pretty straightforward. We use  to manage a simple chat flow — it keeps track of all messages and whether we’re currently waiting for a response.When sendMessage is called, it adds the user’s input to the chat, hits our  route with the message and any aliases, and then updates the messages with whatever the assistant replies. If it fails, we just drop in a fallback error message instead. That’s it.We're pretty much done with the hooks. Now that we have modularized all of these into hooks, why not create another small helper hook for component mount check?Create a new file called  and add the following lines of code:Just a tiny hook to check if the component has mounted on the client. Returns  after the first render, handy for skipping SSR-specific stuff.Finally, after working on four hooks, we are done with the hooks setup. Let's move on to building the API.Great, now it makes sense to work on the API part and then move on to the UI.Head to the  directory and create two different routes: app/api/tts app/api/chat
Great, now let's implement the  route. Create a new file called  in the  directory and add the following lines of code:This is our  route that takes in some text and generates an MP3 audio using OpenAI’s TTS API. We grab the text from the request body, call OpenAI with the model and voice we've set in , and get back a streamable MP3 blob.The important thing is that OpenAI returns an , so we first convert it to a Node  before sending the response back to the client.Great, so now comes the main logic of our application, which is to actually identify if the user is requesting a tool call and, if so, find any relevant alias, and if not, generate a generic response.Create a new file called  in the  directory and add the following lines of code:First, we parse the request body and validate it using Zod (). If it passes, we check whether the message needs tool usage with . If not, it’s just a regular chat, and we pass the message to the LLM () and return the response.If tool use  needed, we pull out the available apps from the user’s saved , and then try to figure out which apps are actually being referred to in the message using .Once we know which apps are in play, we filter the aliases for only those apps and send them through . This uses the LLM again to guess which ones are relevant based on the message. If we find any, we add them to the message as a context block (--- Relevant Parameters ---) so the LLM knows what it’s working with.From here, the heavy lifting is done by executeToolCallingLogic(). This is where the magic happens. We:fetch tools from Composio for the selected apps,start a little conversation history,call the LLM and check if it wants to use any tools (via ),and push results back into the convo.We keep doing this in a loop (max  times), and finally ask the LLM for a clean summary of what just happened.That’s basically it. Long story short, it's like:💡 “Do we need tools? No? Chat. Yes? Find apps → match aliases → call tools → summarize.”That's basically it. This is the heart of our application. If you've understood this, now all that's left is working with the UI.If you're following along, try building it yourself. If not, let's keep going!Let's start with the model where the user will assign aliases as we've discussed. We'll use the  to access the aliases and all the functions to add, edit, and remove aliases.It's going to be pretty straightforward to understand, as we've already worked on the logic; this is just attaching all the logic we've done together to the UI.Create a new file called  in the  directory and add the following lines of code:
          Add Params
        Integration Parameters
            Manage your integration parameters and aliases. Add new parameters
            or remove existing ones.
          
                Current Parameters
              
                                Alias Name
                              
                                Value
                              
              Add New Parameter
            Integration TypeAlias NameValue
                Add Parameter
              CloseGreat, now that the modal is done, let's implement the component that will be responsible for displaying all the messages in the UI.Create a new file called  in the  directory and add the following lines of code:
              How can I help you today?
            
              Use the microphone to speak or type your command below. You can
              configure shortcuts for IDs and URLs in thesettings
              menu.
            This component will receive all the messages and the isLoading prop, and all it does is display them in the UI.The only interesting part of this code is the , which we're using to scroll to the bottom of the messages when new ones are added.Great, so now that displaying the messages is set up, it makes sense to work on the input where the user will send the messages either through voice or with chat.Create a new file called  in the  directory and add the following lines of code:
          Made with 🤍 by Shrijal Acharya @shricodev
        This component is a bit involved with the prop, but it's mostly related to voice inputs.The only work of this component is to call the  function that's passed in the prop.We are also passing the browserSupportsSpeechRecognition prop to the component because many browsers (including Firefox) still do not support the Web Speech API. In such cases, the user can only interact with the bot through chat.Since we're writing very reusable code, let's write the header in a separate component as well, because why not?Create a new file called  in the  directory and add the following lines of code:Voice AI AgentThis component is very simple; it's just a header with a title and a settings button.Cool, so now let's put all of these UI components together in a separate component, which we'll display in the , and that concludes the project.Create a new file called  in the  directory and add the following lines of code:
                  Sorry, your browser does not support speech recognition.
                And again, this is pretty straightforward. The first thing we need to do is check if the component is mounted or not because all of this is supposed to run on the client, as you know these are browser-specific APIs. Then we extract all the fields from useSpeechRecognitionWithDebounce, and based on whether the browser supports recognition, we show conditional UI.Once the transcription is done, we send the message text to the  function, which in turn calls the  function, which, as you remember, sends the message to our  API endpoint.Finally, update the page.tsx in the root directory to display the  component.And with this, our entire application is done! 🎉By the way, I have built another similar MCP-powered chat application that can connect with remotely hosted MCP servers and even locally hosted MCP servers (no matter what)! If it sounds interesting, check it out: 👇Wow, this was a lot of work, but it will definitely be worth it. Imagine you can control all your apps with just your voice. How cool is that? 😎And to be honest, it's perfectly ready for you to use in your daily workflow, and I'd suggest you do the same.This was really fun to build, wasn't it? 👀You can find the entire source code here.Share your thoughts in the comment section below! 👇]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Machine Learning Fundamentals: autoencoder tutorial</title><link>https://dev.to/devopsfundamentals/machine-learning-fundamentals-autoencoder-tutorial-43do</link><author>DevOps Fundamental</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 16:19:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
  
  
  Autoencoder Tutorial: A Production-Grade Deep Dive
Last quarter, a critical anomaly detection system in our fraud prevention pipeline experienced a 30% increase in false positives following a model update. Root cause analysis revealed the new model, while improving overall accuracy, exhibited a significant shift in its latent space representation of legitimate transactions. This wasn’t a model bug , but a failure to adequately monitor and validate the  of the learned representations. This incident highlighted the necessity of robust autoencoder-based anomaly detection tutorials – not as isolated training exercises, but as integral components of a comprehensive MLOps pipeline.  An “autoencoder tutorial” in this context isn’t about learning the algorithm; it’s about building a system for continuous validation of model behavior, feature drift, and data integrity throughout the entire ML lifecycle, from initial data ingestion to eventual model deprecation.  This is crucial for maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) regarding explainability and fairness, and for meeting the stringent latency demands of real-time fraud detection.
  
  
  2. What is "autoencoder tutorial" in Modern ML Infrastructure?
From a systems perspective, an “autoencoder tutorial” represents a continuous monitoring and validation pipeline centered around the latent space learned by an autoencoder. It’s not merely a training script; it’s a service that ingests production data, encodes it using a pre-trained autoencoder, and then analyzes the reconstruction error and latent space distribution. This service interacts heavily with existing MLOps infrastructure.  Data is typically sourced from a feature store (e.g., Feast, Tecton) and fed into the autoencoder via a serving layer (e.g., TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, Seldon Core).  Model versions are managed by MLflow, and training pipelines are orchestrated by Airflow or Kubeflow Pipelines.  Real-time inference often leverages Ray Serve for scalability.  The output of the autoencoder tutorial – reconstruction error, latent space statistics – is then streamed to a monitoring system (Prometheus, Datadog) for alerting and visualization.  System boundaries are critical: the autoencoder tutorial  retrain the primary model; it validates its behavior. Implementation patterns typically involve a shadow deployment of the autoencoder alongside the production model, allowing for comparison of latent space representations without impacting live traffic.
  
  
  3. Use Cases in Real-World ML Systems
Fraud Detection (Fintech):  As illustrated in the introduction, autoencoders identify anomalous transactions by measuring reconstruction error.  A significant deviation from expected reconstruction error signals potential fraud.Network Intrusion Detection (Cybersecurity): Autoencoders learn the normal patterns of network traffic.  Unusual traffic patterns, resulting in high reconstruction error, indicate potential intrusions.Predictive Maintenance (Manufacturing):  Autoencoders model the normal operating conditions of machinery.  Deviations in the latent space can predict impending failures.Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data (E-commerce): Identifying unusual spikes or dips in sales, website traffic, or inventory levels.Data Quality Monitoring (All Verticals): Detecting data drift or corruption by monitoring the reconstruction error on incoming data.  This is particularly valuable in scenarios with evolving data schemas.
  
  
  4. Architecture & Data Workflows

    A[Feature Store] --> B(Data Ingestion Service);
    B --> C{Autoencoder Service (Shadow Deployment)};
    C --> D[Reconstruction Error Calculation];

    J[Model Registry (MLflow)] --> I;
    subgraph Training Pipeline
        J --> K[Autoencoder Training];
        K --> C;
    end
The workflow begins with data ingestion from the feature store. The autoencoder service, deployed in shadow mode, encodes the data. Reconstruction error and latent space statistics are calculated and streamed to the monitoring system. Alerts are triggered based on predefined thresholds.  CI/CD pipelines automatically deploy updated autoencoders whenever the primary model is updated, ensuring alignment. Traffic shaping isn’t directly applicable to the autoencoder tutorial itself, but canary rollouts of the  model are heavily influenced by the autoencoder tutorial’s validation results. Rollback mechanisms involve reverting to the previous autoencoder version if anomalies are detected.
  
  
  5. Implementation Strategies
Python Orchestration (Wrapper):Kubernetes Deployment (YAML):Experiment Tracking (Bash):mlflow experiments create 
mlflow runs create 
mlflow log_param  <RUN_ID> 
mlflow log_metric  <RUN_ID>  <MSE_VALUE>
Reproducibility is ensured through version control of code, data, and model weights. Testability is achieved through unit tests for the validation logic and integration tests to verify end-to-end functionality.
  
  
  6. Failure Modes & Risk Management
 The autoencoder is not updated when the primary model changes, leading to inaccurate validation.  Automated deployment triggered by model registry updates.  Changes in the distribution of input features cause the autoencoder to misinterpret data.  Continuous monitoring of feature distributions and retraining the autoencoder when significant drift is detected.  High traffic or resource contention causes the autoencoder service to become slow.  Autoscaling, caching, and optimized model serving.Reconstruction Error Threshold Misconfiguration:  An incorrectly set threshold leads to false positives or missed anomalies.   A/B testing of different thresholds and dynamic threshold adjustment based on historical data. Corrupted data ingested into the autoencoder leads to inaccurate validation.  Data validation checks before ingestion.
  
  
  7. Performance Tuning & System Optimization
Key metrics: P90/P95 latency of reconstruction error calculation, throughput (requests per second), model accuracy (reconstruction error), and infrastructure cost. Optimization techniques include: batching requests to the autoencoder, caching frequently accessed data, vectorization of calculations, autoscaling the service based on load, and profiling the code to identify bottlenecks.  Batching significantly improves throughput, while autoscaling ensures responsiveness under varying load.  Reducing model size (e.g., quantization) can lower latency and infrastructure costs.
  
  
  8. Monitoring, Observability & Debugging
Observability stack: Prometheus for metric collection, Grafana for visualization, OpenTelemetry for tracing, Evidently for data drift detection, and Datadog for comprehensive monitoring. Critical metrics: reconstruction error (mean, standard deviation, percentiles), latent space distance from baseline, service latency, error rates, and resource utilization. Alert conditions: reconstruction error exceeding a threshold, significant drift in latent space, and service latency exceeding a threshold. Log traces should include request IDs for debugging. Anomaly detection algorithms can be applied to reconstruction error to identify unexpected patterns.
  
  
  9. Security, Policy & Compliance
Audit logging of all data access and model predictions is essential. Reproducibility is ensured through version control and experiment tracking. Secure model and data access is enforced using IAM roles and Vault for secret management. ML metadata tracking tools (e.g., MLflow) provide traceability and lineage.  OPA (Open Policy Agent) can be used to enforce data governance policies.
  
  
  10. CI/CD & Workflow Integration
Integration with GitHub Actions:Deployment gates ensure that the autoencoder is only deployed if all tests pass. Automated tests verify the functionality of the validation logic. Rollback logic automatically reverts to the previous autoencoder version if anomalies are detected. Argo Workflows or Kubeflow Pipelines can orchestrate the entire process.
  
  
  11. Common Engineering Pitfalls
 Failing to monitor and address changes in input feature distributions.  Lack of comprehensive monitoring of reconstruction error and latent space statistics.Overly Sensitive Thresholds: Setting reconstruction error thresholds too low, leading to false positives.Lack of Automated Deployment:  Manually deploying the autoencoder, leading to inconsistencies and delays.  Failing to optimize the autoencoder service for low latency.Debugging workflows involve analyzing log traces, visualizing latent space distributions, and comparing reconstruction error distributions between different model versions.
  
  
  12. Best Practices at Scale
Mature ML platforms like Uber Michelangelo and Spotify Cortex emphasize modularity, scalability, and automation. Scalability patterns include horizontal scaling of the autoencoder service and distributed data processing. Tenancy is achieved through resource isolation and access control. Operational cost tracking is essential for optimizing resource utilization.  A maturity model should be used to assess the effectiveness of the autoencoder tutorial and identify areas for improvement.  The ultimate goal is to connect the autoencoder tutorial to business impact by reducing fraud losses, improving product quality, or increasing operational efficiency.An autoencoder tutorial, when implemented as a robust and integrated MLOps component, is critical for maintaining the reliability and trustworthiness of large-scale ML systems.  Next steps include benchmarking the autoencoder service against different hardware configurations, integrating it with a more sophisticated data drift detection system, and conducting regular security audits.  Continuous improvement and adaptation are essential for ensuring that the autoencoder tutorial remains effective in the face of evolving data and model landscapes.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>JL 2.4G Bluetooth Low-Latency Audio Headset Solution: Chip Selection, Latency, Hardware Design</title><link>https://dev.to/ble_voice/jl-24g-bluetooth-low-latency-audio-headset-solution-chip-selection-latency-hardware-design-4e38</link><author>Junluan Tsui</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 16:17:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This document introduces JL's low-latency audio headset solution using 2.4G/Bluetooth technology.:

Over the past two months, OpenAI has rolled out native in‑chat shopping features—powered by partnerships with Shopify, Visa, and major retailers—allowing users not only to explore and compare products, but to complete purchases without leaving the chat interface. This article examines what ChatGPT can buy for you, how it works under the hood, its advantages over traditional e‑commerce, and what both consumers and merchants need to know to make the most of this emerging “conversational commerce” paradigm.
  
  
  What new shopping capabilities does ChatGPT offer?

  
  
  Conversational product discovery
Rather than typing keywords into a search engine, users can now ask ChatGPT natural‑language questions like “Show me the best wireless earbuds under $100 with noise cancellation” and receive a curated list of products—complete with images, specifications, pricing, and reviews—in seconds. This “shopping mode” launched in late April 2025 and sources real‑time data directly from merchant catalogs and data partners, eliminating out‑of‑date listings and reducing decision fatigue .
  
  
  In‑chat checkout and payment integration
Beyond recommendations, ChatGPT now supports an end‑to‑end purchase flow. Thanks to a native integration discovered in ChatGPT’s JavaScript bundle (with Shopify variable names identified as early as April 20, 2025), users can add items to a virtual cart and complete checkout—all within the chat window . Visa has also announced plans to embed its payment network directly into AI platforms, enabling payment details to be securely tokenized and reused across future chats .
  
  
  Product Carousels and Recommendations
Rather than showing plain text links, ChatGPT presents visually rich product carousels that draw from both editorial sources (e.g., WIRED buying guides) and real‑time web data (e.g., retailer inventories and customer reviews). The model aggregates user-specified preferences—such as price range or style—and previous conversation context (e.g., “I hate cigarette‑smoke scents”) to tailor recommendations . According to OpenAI’s Adam Fry, ChatGPT already handles over a billion web searches per week, many of which relate to shopping; the new feature simply formalizes and enriches that use case.
  
  
  How does ChatGPT integrate with e‑commerce platforms?

  
  
  Redirection to Merchant Sites
Despite integrating “Buy” buttons, ChatGPT does not process payments directly. Instead, clicking a shopping button redirects users to the merchant’s website, where the transaction is completed using the retailer’s native checkout system . This design both leverages existing, secure payment infrastructures and sidesteps the need for OpenAI to handle sensitive financial data directly.
  
  
  Shopify partnership and native flows
OpenAI’s strategic collaboration with Shopify is at the heart of the in‑chat shopping experience. Merchant consent, real‑time inventory, pricing updates, promotions, order sync, and fulfillment tracking are all handled through Shopify’s APIs and webhooks. This tight coupling ensures product availability and pricing in ChatGPT mirror the merchant’s live store, solving the “out‑of‑stock” and “stale price” issues common to third‑party marketplaces.
  
  
  Third‑party retailer links and affiliate models
In addition to Shopify, ChatGPT aggregates offerings from major retailers—Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart—via deep‑web product feeds and affiliate integration. Early experiments surface “Buy Now” buttons that redirect to the retailer’s checkout page, with OpenAI exploring affiliate‑revenue sharing models to monetize these referrals. While OpenAI currently does not place paid ads in shopping results, industry observers expect a shift toward hybrid monetization (affiliate fees, sponsored placements) once core user experience is proven .
  
  
  What distinguishes ChatGPT shopping from traditional e‑commerce?

  
  
  Personalized, ad‑free recommendations
Unlike keyword‑based search engines, ChatGPT shopping emphasizes personalization through context‑aware dialog. If a user refines a query (“What if I want something eco‑friendly?”), the model instantly adjusts suggestions. Importantly, OpenAI has positioned this feature as “recommendation‑first,” with no ad placements to date—prioritizing user trust and perceived neutrality.Real‑time syncing with merchant systems via Shopify and vetted data aggregators ensures that product specifications, stock levels, pricing, and shipping estimates remain accurate. This trustworthiness is critical: 78% of online shoppers cite “out‑of‑stock” errors and stale pricing as the biggest pain points in e‑commerce, and AI models trained solely on web‑scraped data have historically struggled to keep up .
  
  
  How secure and private is shopping via ChatGPT?

  
  
  Data handling and payment info security
To process payments, ChatGPT leverages end‑to‑end encryption and tokenization protocols. Visa’s integration allows users to vault their payment credentials once, then authorize transactions with a simple chat command or biometric confirmation on their device. All personally identifiable information (PII) and payment data are stored on PCI‑compliant servers under merchant control, not within OpenAI’s systems, mitigating breach risks .
  
  
  Trust barriers and countermeasures
Despite robust security measures, consumer trust remains a key hurdle. A recent Axios survey found that 52% of AI shopping users worry about unintended charges or data misuse. To address this, OpenAI has introduced transparency controls—users can view all pending charges before approval, revoke vendor payment access at any time, and review detailed order histories within the chat interface. These safeguards aim to build confidence in a nascent transactional channel .
  
  
  What are the technical underpinnings enabling ChatGPT to shop?

  
  
  Plugins and API Integrations
ChatGPT’s shopping feature builds on the existing plugins framework, which allows third‑party services to extend the model’s capabilities. Retailers and affiliate networks can develop plugins or APIs that provide up‑to‑date product catalogs, pricing, and availability. When a shopping query is detected, ChatGPT invokes these plugins to fetch live data, assembles a ranked list of options, and formats the results into an interactive carousel.
  
  
  AI‑driven Personalization
The core language model (e.g., GPT-4o or GPT‑4o‑mini) applies advanced personalization by recalling user preferences specified earlier in the conversation—like preferred brands, budget constraints, or stylistic tastes—and factoring in sentiment cues. For instance, if a user previously expressed a dislike for “clown costumes,” ChatGPT will omit such items from its list of Halloween recommendations for pet costumes . This dynamic context‑aware filtering represents a step beyond static “best of” lists, aligning suggestions closely with individual needs.
  
  
  How can businesses and users enable and optimize ChatGPT shopping?

  
  
  For merchants: integration and API setup
Merchants on Shopify can opt into ChatGPT Shopping via their admin dashboard. Enabling the “Conversational Commerce” toggle publishes their product catalog to OpenAI’s data aggregator, along with API keys for order creation and fulfillment updates. Best practices include:Maintaining real‑time inventory feeds to prevent overselling with attributes like “eco‑friendly,” “on sale,” or “fast shipping” to enhance AI filteringMonitoring conversational analytics in Shopify’s analytics suite to see which queries drive the most conversions .Larger retailers and direct‑to‑consumer brands can implement the ChatGPT Shopping SDK (released May 2025) to customize the chat UI, loyalty rewards integration, and cross‑platform analytics.
  
  
  For users: accessing shopping features
Access to ChatGPT shopping is available on both web and mobile apps. Users simply start a new conversation with prompts like “I want to buy…” or select the “Shopping” mode from the sidebar. Once enabled, they can:: “Show me recommended laptops under $1,500.”: “Filter to models with 16 GB RAM and SSD storage.”: “Compare Battery life between these two.”: “Add the first one to my cart and checkout.”For payment, users link a Visa, Mastercard, or digital wallet once; subsequent purchases use a secure token, requiring only a simple confirmation phrase (e.g., “Confirm purchase of $299.99”) .The advent of in‑chat shopping marks a turning point: AI’s ability to not only inform but to transact transforms ChatGPT from a passive assistant into an active agent of commerce. By blending natural language understanding with secure payment flows and real‑time merchant integrations, ChatGPT is poised to reshape how consumers discover, compare, and purchase products—and how businesses engage with customers in an increasingly conversational world.CometAPI provides a unified REST interface that aggregates hundreds of AI models—under a consistent endpoint, with built-in API-key management, usage quotas, and billing dashboards.

All You Need to Know</title><link>https://dev.to/_37bbf0c253c0b3edec531e/can-claude-create-images-all-you-need-to-know-1lif</link><author>安萨</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 15:56:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In recent months, a growing number of developers and enterprises have asked a common question: Can Anthropic’s Claude models generate new images directly? While Claude has made impressive strides in multimodal understanding—allowing users to upload and analyze images—the ability to  generate novel visuals remains a point of confusion.
  
  
  What is Claude and what can it currently do?
Claude is a family of large language models (LLMs) developed by Anthropic, a leading AI research and development company founded by former OpenAI executives. Since its initial public release in March 2023, Claude has evolved through multiple major versions—Claude 1, Claude 2, Claude 3 (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus), and most recently Claude 4 (Opus 4 and Sonnet 4) released on May 22, 2025. Claude models are designed to be highly capable conversational agents, excelling at tasks such as drafting documents, writing and debugging code, answering complex questions, and performing advanced reasoning tasks .Anthropic positions Claude as a “safe, helpful, and steerable” assistant that can connect to your documents, tools, and the web, enabling seamless integration into enterprise workflows. Key features include multi-hour “extended thinking,” which allows the model to pause and fetch additional data before continuing its response, and “Artifacts,” a no‑code tool that lets users turn prompts into shareable mini-applications, visualizations, and automations without the need for programming expertise.While Claude’s text-based abilities have been the core focus, starting with Claude 3, the model gained the capacity to ingest and analyze images as inputs—enabling users to upload photos, diagrams, or screenshots and ask questions about them. Despite these multimodal input capabilities, Anthropic has not officially launched any native image generation feature akin to DALL·E or Stable Diffusion as of June 30, 2025 .
  
  
  Can Claude generate images right now?

  
  
  Current state of image generation support
As of June 30, 2025, Claude’s publicly available offerings do  include a feature for generating images from scratch. Unlike some competing platforms—such as OpenAI’s DALL·E or Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion—Claude lacks a built‑in text‑to‑image engine that can render entirely new visuals based on user prompts .Anthropic has prioritized safety, interpretability, and enterprise utility in Claude’s roadmap, focusing on text and code reasoning, tool integration (e.g., API calls, web searches), and generative workflows such as Artifacts. The omission of native image generation suggests a deliberate choice, likely motivated by Anthropic’s safety‑first ethos and concerns over misuse of synthesized imagery.
  
  
  Third‑party tools and workarounds
While Claude itself does not directly produce images, developers and enterprises can integrate Claude’s API with external image-generation services. For instance, in a prototype workflow, Claude could draft a textual description and then invoke another API—such as DALL·E or an open‑source diffusion model—to translate that description into visuals. This hybrid approach allows organizations to leverage Claude’s advanced reasoning and prompt‑crafting strengths while outsourcing the actual image synthesis to specialized models .Such integrations highlight Claude’s extensibility but also underscore the fact that, out of the box, Claude remains focused on text-based and analytical tasks rather than full-fledged multimodal output generation.
  
  
  Why hasn’t Anthropic enabled image generation in Claude?

  
  
  Safety and alignment considerations
Anthropic’s charter emphasizes building AI that is safe, steerable, and aligned with human values. Generative vision models—while immensely popular—pose unique challenges around misuse, deepfakes, and style‑based appropriation. By withholding image‑generation capabilities, Anthropic reduces the risk of generating harmful or misleading imagery, aligning with its commitment to a “responsible scaling” approach .
  
  
  Technical and resource trade‑offs
Developing high‑fidelity image generators requires vast computational resources and specialized training data. Anthropic may have opted to concentrate engineering efforts on advanced reasoning, coding, and multimodal  rather than diverting capacity to image synthesis. This focus has paid dividends: Claude Opus 4 was recently lauded as “the world’s best coding model,” underscoring Anthropic’s decision to prioritize text‑based and reasoning advances over image generation.
  
  
  How does Claude compare to other multimodal models?
Several other major AI platforms offer integrated text-to-image capabilities alongside language understanding:: GPT-Image-1 is designed to generate and edit high-quality images from textual prompts, offering users the ability to create visuals in diverse styles and formats .Google’s Imagen and Gemini: Google’s Gemini Ultra merges text, code, and image generation in a unified model, promising higher-quality visuals but with Google’s extensive safety pipeline.Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion: An open-source powerhouse for image synthesis, widely adopted in creative and research communities.None of these offerings match Claude’s extended reasoning or prompt-driven tool integration, but they outpace Claude in pure image generation quality and flexibility.
  
  
  Multimodal analysis vs. generation
Claude excels at —understanding and reasoning about images provided by users—and , where it orchestrates web queries, code execution, and external APIs to fulfill complex, multi-step workflows. Its omission of native image generation doesn’t inhibit its ability to explain, critique, or improve visuals supplied by users.By contrast, models like Stable Diffusion focus exclusively on producing images, lacking the deep reasoning and step-by-step problem‑solving that Claude demonstrates in text-based tasks. Organizations requiring mixed media workflows often combine Claude’s reasoning with external diffusion models to achieve the best of both worlds.
  
  
  What are the technical limitations and best practices?
Even with a two‑step pipeline, developers must navigate constraints to achieve high‑quality results.
  
  
  Latency and cost considerations
Chaining two APIs—one for prompt generation and one for image synthesis—doubles processing time and can amplify token‑or‑compute costs. Budgeting for end‑to‑end latency is crucial, especially in real‑time applications.
  
  
  Prompt fidelity and iteration

We write code that looks like payment.customers.create({email: "user@example.com"}), memorize method names, wrestle with documentation, and inevitably break things when APIs evolve. Meanwhile, the AI world is moving toward protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol) designed specifically for agents. Both humans and AI need programmatic access to the same resources, so what about us human developers caught in the middle?
  
  
  The multi-layered API problem
Here's some typical example code for creating a customer with company FooCorp's SDK:Six months later, the API provider (hopefully unintentionally) updates their schema. The  field is deprecated in favor of separate  and  fields. Your code breaks. You shake your fist in anger, update the SDK, fix your code, test everything, and deploy.But there's another layer to this problem. As Frank Fiegel points out, traditional HTTP APIs suffer from "combinatorial chaos" - data scattered across URL paths, headers, query parameters, and request bodies. This makes them particularly hard for AI agents to use reliably.The AI community's answer is MCP (Model Context Protocol), which provides AI-friendly interfaces that they can easily adopt. But that leaves human developers in an interesting position: we still need to work with thousands of existing APIs that don't have MCP servers.
  
  
  The SDK provider's burden
The pain isn't just felt by developers—SDK providers face their own set of challenges that make the current system unsustainable.When a new version is released, particularly a major version, providers essentially have to beg developers to upgrade. This creates a frustrating dynamic where providers want to innovate and improve their APIs, but are held back by the friction of SDK adoption.Without implementing complex API versioning systems, any breaking change means potentially nuking integrations that use older versions of the SDK. This is especially painful for languages with strong type safety, where minor schema changes can cause compilation failures across entire codebases.Consider the maintenance burden: a popular API provider might need to maintain SDKs for JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Go, Java, C#, and more. Each language has its own conventions, package managers, and release cycles. When the API changes, that's potentially 8+ SDKs that need updating, testing, and coordinating releases. Auto-generating SDKs from an OpenAPI spec can help with development, but you still have to deal with the one thing out of your control: user adoption.SDK providers often find themselves supporting legacy versions for years because large enterprise customers can't easily upgrade. This fragments the ecosystem and slows innovation.The result? Many API providers either:Move extremely slowly to avoid breaking changesImplement complex versioning schemes that add overheadAccept that a significant portion of their user base will always be on outdated SDKsIt's getting harder for infra teams to make the case to upgrade SDKs that are still working, meaning you have to be landing world-changing features to give users a reason to do it.A natural language approach could help break this cycle by making the integration layer more resilient to API changes, reducing the pressure on both sides.
  
  
  A natural language bridge
Instead of memorizing SDK methods or building MCP servers from scratch, what if we could describe what we want in natural language?A thin wrapper is used in conjunction with an LLM to parse the request. Under the hood, an LLM reads the API's OpenAPI specification and your natural language request, then generates the appropriate HTTP call. When the API evolves, the system adapts automatically. The wrapper is installed once and never needs to be updated.
  
  
  Self-healing: when APIs change overnight
Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this approach is its potential for self-healing behavior. Traditional SDKs break when APIs evolve, but an LLM-powered system can potentially adapt in real-time.Here's how it works: when an API call fails with a 400 error (indicating the request format is wrong), the agent can automatically:Invalidate the cached request patternRe-read the latest OpenAPI specificationGenerate a fresh request with the LLMCache the new pattern locally for future use
The self-healing loop looks something like this:This creates a fascinating dynamic: the first time you encounter a breaking API change in your project, you pay the "healing cost" (LLM latency and usage), but subsequent calls in your local environment benefit from the updated cache.: This self-healing behavior works best for schema changes (field renames, new required fields) but couldn't handle semantic changes where the fundamental operation changes. It's also not foolproof—sometimes a 400 error indicates bad user input, not API evolution.
  
  
  Local caching for performance
One advantage of this approach is local semantic caching. The first time you ask to "create customer", the system pays the LLM cost and caches the result locally. But "create customer", "add new customer", and "register user" are semantically similar—they can share the same cached response.The cache grows organically within your local environment. Popular patterns in your codebase become as fast as traditional SDK calls, without the security concerns of shared caches or the maintenance burden of community-managed packages.
  
  
  Security: the elephant in the room
The benefits are hopefully self-apparent, but we need to address the significant security implications. Having an LLM generate and execute API calls introduces several attack vectors that don't exist with traditional SDKs:: If user input influences the natural language task description, malicious users could potentially inject instructions that cause the LLM to generate unintended API calls:
: LLMs sometimes include sensitive data in their reasoning process. There's a risk that API keys or other credentials could be logged or leaked through the LLM's output.: Unlike traditional SDKs where operations are explicit, natural language instructions could be misinterpreted in dangerous ways:: The automatic healing mechanism could potentially "fix" API calls in ways that bypass intended security restrictions or change the operation's scope.These security concerns would need to be thoroughly addressed through:Strict input sanitization and validation (i.e. guardrails)Sandboxed execution environmentsAudit logging of all LLM-generated requestsRate limiting and anomaly detectionClear boundaries around which operations are allowedHuman review processes for sensitive operationsThe security model would be fundamentally different from traditional SDKs, where the attack surface is well-understood and contained.
  
  
  Learning from MCP's design principles
The MCP approach teaches us important lessons about AI-API integration. As the Frank Fiegel article linked above explains, MCP solves the reliability problem by having "LLM picks which tool → wrapped code executes deterministically" rather than "LLM writes the HTTP request → hallucinated paths, wrong parameters."The initial approach of having LLMs generate raw HTTP requests has an inherent reliability problem. A better architecture might generate MCP-style tool calls:This gives us the safety and determinism that MCP tools provide while maintaining the natural language interface for human developers. It also significantly reduces the security attack surface since the LLM only picks from pre-defined tools rather than generating arbitrary HTTP requests.Instead of several SDKs, we have thin wrappers to make calls to the LLM. The MCP tooling is kept up to date either by using official MCP servers or those generated from an OpenAPI spec.
  
  
  CLI simplicity for human workflows
The concept extends naturally to command-line usage, bridging the gap between human workflows and API complexity:
my-agent call 
my-agent cache stats

my-agent cache health

  
  
  Fitting into the MCP ecosystem
Rather than competing with MCP, this approach could complement it in several ways:: Use natural language examples to auto-generate MCP servers from OpenAPI specs:
Developer-Friendly MCP Interface: Provide a natural language layer on top of existing MCP servers:
: Help developers quickly explore APIs before building proper MCP integrations.
  
  
  The type safety challenge
One significant trade-off of this approach becomes apparent when we look at the return values. With traditional SDKs, you get compile-time guarantees:But with natural language calls, we lose that certainty:This is a fundamental trade-off between flexibility and type safety. However, there are several potential solutions:
  
  
  Generated Types from OpenAPI

  
  
  Runtime Schema Validation
The wrapper could learn response shapes over time and provide IDE suggestions based on previous calls to similar endpoints.
  
  
  The pros: what works well
: Describing intent in natural language feels more human than memorizing SDK methods or building MCP servers.: Works with existing APIs immediately, no need to wait for MCP server implementations.Self-healing capabilities: Can automatically adapt to API changes without developer intervention.: The thin wrapper is installed once and never needs updating, eliminating a major pain point of traditional SDKs.: Semantic caching means popular patterns in your codebase become fast without external dependencies.: Could generate MCP-style tool calls for better reliability while maintaining natural language UX.: Reduces the burden on SDK providers to maintain multiple language implementations and coordinate releases.
  
  
  The cons: honest challenges
: Introduces new attack vectors around prompt injection, credential exposure, and unvalidated operations that don't exist with traditional SDKs.: Even with structured output, LLMs can misinterpret intent. MCP's pre-built tools are inherently more reliable.: Can handle schema changes but not semantic API changes. May incorrectly "heal" when the real issue is bad user input.: Adding an LLM layer introduces latency and complexity that SDKs avoid.: When the system makes automatic decisions, developers need comprehensive logging and review capabilities.: This is designed for human developers, while the ecosystem is moving toward AI agents that work better with MCP.
  
  
  Where this fits (and doesn't)
This concept has exciting potential across several contexts:Human developers working with legacy APIs that lack MCP serversRapid prototyping and API exploration where speed matters more than perfectionEducational contexts where natural language reduces learning curveBuilding MCP servers by auto-generating from examplesDevelopment environments where the convenience-security trade-off makes senseProduction AI agents (MCP is purpose-built for this)Security-sensitive operations without extensive safeguardsComplex workflows requiring bidirectional communicationMission-critical applications where determinism is paramount
  
  
  Exciting possibilities ahead
What excites me most about this approach is how it could reduce real pain SDK providers and consumers are feeling. Most APIs don't have MCP servers yet, and most developers aren't building pure AI agents. This natural language approach could serve as valuable scaffolding—making existing APIs more approachable while the ecosystem evolves toward MCP.The self-healing aspect opens up particularly interesting possibilities for developers working with rapidly evolving APIs. Imagine a world where your integrations automatically adapt to API changes without requiring wrapper updates or manual intervention.The security challenges are real, but they're solvable with the right architectural decisions—particularly if we embrace the MCP-style approach of having LLMs pick from pre-defined tools rather than generating arbitrary requests and use increasingly industry standard guardrails on inputs and outputs.I'm writing this largely to measure whether others see merit in the idea. Next steps are to build an open source proof of concept. Have comments or want to help out?

  Autoencoder Projects: A Production-Grade Deep Dive
Last quarter, a critical anomaly detection system in our fraud prevention pipeline experienced a 30% increase in false positives following a model update. Root cause analysis revealed the new model, while improving overall accuracy, exhibited a significant shift in its latent space representation of legitimate transactions. This wasn’t a model bug , but a failure to adequately monitor and validate the  of the learned representations. This incident highlighted the necessity of a dedicated “autoencoder project” – a system for monitoring, validating, and governing the latent spaces generated by autoencoders used across our ML infrastructure.An autoencoder project isn’t simply about training autoencoders. It’s a holistic system encompassing data pipelines, model training, validation, deployment, monitoring, and rollback mechanisms specifically tailored to the unique challenges of working with learned representations. It’s a core component of a mature MLOps practice, addressing compliance requirements for model explainability and enabling scalable inference for anomaly detection, feature engineering, and data quality monitoring.
  
  
  2. What is "autoencoder project" in Modern ML Infrastructure?
An “autoencoder project” in a modern ML infrastructure is a dedicated set of tools and processes for managing the lifecycle of autoencoders and the latent spaces they produce. It’s not a single model, but a  built around them.  This system interacts heavily with existing MLOps components: For tracking autoencoder training runs, parameters, metrics (reconstruction loss, KL divergence), and model versions. Orchestrating data pipelines for training data preparation, latent space validation, and periodic retraining. Distributed training of autoencoders, particularly for large datasets. Deploying autoencoder inference services and latent space monitoring agents.Feature Store (Feast, Tecton):  Storing and serving latent representations as features for downstream models.Cloud ML Platforms (SageMaker, Vertex AI): Leveraging managed services for training, deployment, and monitoring.The key trade-off is between the complexity of managing a dedicated system versus the risk of undetected latent space drift impacting downstream applications. System boundaries typically involve defining clear ownership of the autoencoder project, establishing data quality SLAs for training data, and defining acceptable thresholds for latent space drift. Common implementation patterns include: 1) dedicated autoencoder pipelines for each use case, 2) a centralized autoencoder service serving latent representations to multiple downstream models, and 3) a hybrid approach combining both.
  
  
  3. Use Cases in Real-World ML Systems
Autoencoder projects are critical in several real-world scenarios:Fraud Detection (Fintech): Identifying anomalous transactions by measuring reconstruction error in the latent space.  A sudden increase in reconstruction error for a specific transaction type can signal fraudulent activity.Anomaly Detection in Manufacturing: Detecting defects in products by training autoencoders on images or sensor data from normal operation.Personalized Recommendations (E-commerce):  Generating user embeddings (latent representations) for collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation systems. Monitoring embedding drift can indicate changes in user behavior.Data Quality Monitoring (Health Tech): Identifying outliers in patient data (e.g., vital signs) by measuring reconstruction error. This can flag potential data entry errors or medical anomalies.Model Rollout Validation (Autonomous Systems):  Comparing the latent space representations generated by a new model version to those of the existing production model. Significant divergence indicates potential issues with the new model's behavior.

        N --> O(Canary Rollout);
        O --> E;
    end
The typical workflow involves: 1) Data ingestion and preprocessing, 2) Autoencoder training using a distributed framework (Ray), 3) Model registration in MLflow, 4) Deployment of the autoencoder as a microservice on Kubernetes, 5) Continuous monitoring of the latent space using Prometheus and Evidently, 6) Alerting on anomalies, and 7) CI/CD pipelines for automated model updates and rollbacks. Traffic shaping (using Istio or similar) allows for canary rollouts, gradually shifting traffic to the new model while monitoring its performance. Rollback mechanisms are triggered by exceeding predefined thresholds for reconstruction error or latent space drift.
  
  
  5. Implementation Strategies
Python Orchestration (wrapper for MLflow):Kubernetes Deployment (YAML):Experiment Tracking (Bash):mlflow experiments create  autoencoder_experiments
mlflow runs create  autoencoder_experiments  autoencoder_run_1
python train_autoencoder.py  value1  value2
mlflow models package  runs:/mlflow runs get-run-id autoencoder_experiments/autoencoder_run_1 autoencoder_model

  
  
  6. Failure Modes & Risk Management
Potential failure modes include: Autoencoders trained on outdated data may not accurately represent current data distributions. Changes in the input data distribution can lead to significant latent space drift. Increased load or inefficient inference code can cause latency spikes. Unexpectedly high reconstruction errors can indicate data corruption or model failure.  Malicious actors could craft inputs designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the autoencoder.Mitigation strategies include: automated retraining pipelines triggered by data drift detection, circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures, automated rollback to previous model versions, and robust input validation.
  
  
  7. Performance Tuning & System Optimization
Key metrics: P90/P95 latency, throughput (requests per second), reconstruction loss, KL divergence, and infrastructure cost. Optimization techniques include: Processing multiple inputs in a single inference request. Caching frequently accessed latent representations. Utilizing optimized libraries (e.g., NumPy, TensorFlow) for efficient computation. Dynamically adjusting the number of autoencoder instances based on load. Identifying performance bottlenecks using tools like cProfile or PyTorch Profiler.
  
  
  8. Monitoring, Observability & Debugging
Observability stack: Prometheus for metric collection, Grafana for visualization, OpenTelemetry for tracing, Evidently for latent space drift detection, and Datadog for comprehensive monitoring. Critical metrics: reconstruction error distribution, KL divergence, latency, throughput, and resource utilization. Alert conditions: exceeding predefined thresholds for reconstruction error, significant latent space drift, or latency spikes.
  
  
  9. Security, Policy & Compliance
Autoencoder projects must adhere to security and compliance requirements. This includes: audit logging of model training and inference requests, secure access control to data and models (IAM, Vault), and reproducibility of experiments (MLflow). Governance tools like OPA can enforce policies related to data privacy and model fairness.
  
  
  10. CI/CD & Workflow Integration
Integration with CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Argo Workflows) is crucial. Deployment gates should include automated tests for model accuracy, latent space stability, and performance. Rollback logic should be automated based on predefined failure criteria.
  
  
  11. Common Engineering Pitfalls
Ignoring Latent Space Drift: Failing to monitor and validate the latent space can lead to undetected model degradation.Insufficient Data Quality Checks: Poor data quality can result in inaccurate latent representations.  Inability to reproduce experiments hinders debugging and auditing.Overly Complex Architectures:  Unnecessary complexity increases maintenance overhead and reduces reliability.Ignoring Adversarial Robustness:  Failing to consider potential adversarial attacks can compromise system security.
  
  
  12. Best Practices at Scale
Lessons from mature ML platforms (Michelangelo, Cortex) emphasize:Centralized Model Registry: A single source of truth for all models.Automated Data Validation:  Rigorous data quality checks at every stage of the pipeline.Standardized Monitoring & Alerting: Consistent metrics and alerting across all ML systems.Cost Tracking & Optimization:  Monitoring and optimizing infrastructure costs.Tenancy & Resource Isolation:  Ensuring fair resource allocation and preventing interference between different teams.An autoencoder project is no longer a “nice-to-have” but a “must-have” for organizations deploying autoencoders at scale. It’s a critical component of a robust MLOps practice, enabling reliable, scalable, and compliant ML systems. Next steps include benchmarking different autoencoder architectures, integrating with advanced anomaly detection algorithms, and conducting regular security audits.  Investing in a dedicated autoencoder project is an investment in the long-term health and reliability of your ML infrastructure.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Utilize machine learning to improve employee retention rates</title><link>https://www.datasciencecentral.com/utilize-machine-learning-to-improve-employee-retention-rates/</link><author>Zachary Amos</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 14:59:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.datasciencecentral.com/">Data Science Central</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Employee turnover is one of the most pressing challenges modern businesses face.

Although text documents are well-integrated into modern knowledge management systems, rich information contained in diagrams, charts, technical schematics, and visual documentation often remains inaccessible to search and AI assistants. This creates significant gaps in organizational knowledge bases, leading to interpreting visual data manually and preventing automation systems from using critical visual information for comprehensive insights and decision-making. While Amazon Q Business already handles embedded images within documents, the custom document enrichment (CDE) feature extends these capabilities significantly by processing standalone image files (for example, JPGs and PNGs).In this post, we look at a step-by-step implementation for using the CDE feature within an Amazon Q Business application. We walk you through an AWS Lambda function configured within CDE to process various image file types, and we showcase an example scenario of how this integration enhances the Amazon Q Business ability to provide comprehensive insights. By following this practical guide, you can significantly expand your organization’s searchable knowledge base, enabling more complete answers and insights that incorporate both textual and visual information sources.Example scenario: Analyzing regional educational demographicsConsider a scenario where you’re working for a national educational consultancy that has charts, graphs, and demographic data across different AWS Regions stored in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. The following image shows student distribution by age range across various cities using a bar chart. The insights in visualizations like this are valuable for decision-making but traditionally locked within image formats in your S3 buckets and other storage.With Amazon Q Business and CDE, we show you how to enable natural language queries against such visualizations. For example, your team could ask questions such as “Which city has the highest number of students in the 13–15 age range?” or “Compare the student demographics between City 1 and City 4” directly through the Amazon Q Business application interface.You can bridge this gap using the Amazon Q Business CDE feature to:Detect and process image files during the document ingestion processExtract structured data and insights from charts and graphsMake this information searchable using natural language queriesIn this solution, we walk you through how to implement a CDE-based solution for your educational demographic data visualizations. The solution empowers organizations to extract meaningful information from image files using the CDE capability of Amazon Q Business. When Amazon Q Business encounters the S3 path during ingestion, CDE rules automatically trigger a Lambda function. The Lambda function identifies the image files and calls the Amazon Bedrock API, which uses multimodal large language models (LLMs) to analyze and extract contextual information from each image. The extracted text is then seamlessly integrated into the knowledge base in Amazon Q Business. End users can then quickly search for valuable data and insights from images based on their actual context. By bridging the gap between visual content and searchable text, this solution helps organizations unlock valuable insights previously hidden within their image repositories.The following figure shows the high-level architecture diagram used for this solution.For this use case, we use Amazon S3 as our data source. However, this same solution is adaptable to other data source types supported by Amazon Q Business, or it can be implemented with custom data sources as needed.To complete the solution, follow these high-level implementation steps:Create an Amazon Q Business application and sync with an S3 bucket.Configure the Amazon Q Business application CDE for the Amazon S3 data source.Extract context from the images.The following prerequisites are needed for implementation:Create an Amazon Q Business application and sync with an S3 bucketTo create an Amazon Q Business application and connect it to your S3 bucket, complete the following steps. These steps provide a general overview of how to create an Amazon Q Business application and synchronize it with an S3 bucket. For more comprehensive, step-by-step guidance, follow the detailed instructions in the blog post Discover insights from Amazon S3 with Amazon Q S3 connector.Create an index for your Amazon Q Business application.Use the built-in Amazon S3 connector to link your application with documents stored in your organization’s S3 buckets.Configure the Amazon Q Business application CDE for the Amazon S3 data sourceWith the CDE feature of Amazon Q Business, you can make the most of your Amazon S3 data sources by using the sophisticated capabilities to modify, enhance, and filter documents during the ingestion process, ultimately making enterprise content more discoverable and valuable. When connecting Amazon Q Business to S3 repositories, you can use CDE to seamlessly transform your raw data, applying modifications that significantly improve search quality and information accessibility. This powerful functionality extends to extracting context from binary files such as images through integration with Amazon Bedrock services, enabling organizations to unlock insights from previously inaccessible content formats. By implementing CDE for Amazon S3 data sources, businesses can maximize the utility of their enterprise data within Amazon Q, creating a more comprehensive and intelligent knowledge base that responds effectively to user queries.To configure the Amazon Q Business application CDE for the Amazon S3 data source, complete the following steps:Select your application and navigate to .Choose your existing Amazon S3 data source or create a new one. Verify that  under Multi-media content configuration is not enabled.In the data source configuration, locate the Custom Document Enrichment section.Configure the pre-extraction rules to trigger a Lambda function when specific S3 bucket conditions are satisfied. Check the following screenshot for an example configuration. Pre-extraction rules are executed before Amazon Q Business processes files from your S3 bucket.Extract context from the imagesTo extract insights from an image file, the Lambda function makes an Amazon Bedrock API call using Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet model. You can modify the code to use other Amazon Bedrock models based on your use case.Constructing the prompt is a critical piece of the code. We recommend trying various prompts to get the desired output for your use case. Amazon Bedrock offers the capability to optimize a prompt that you can use to enhance your use case specific input.Examine the following Lambda function code snippets, written in Python, to understand the Amazon Bedrock model setup along with a sample prompt to extract insights from an image.import boto3

In addition to Amazon Q pricing, this solution will incur charges for AWS Lambda and Amazon Bedrock. For more information, refer to AWS Lambda pricing and Amazon Bedrock pricing.After the Amazon S3 data is synced with the Amazon Q index, you can prompt the Amazon Q Business application to get the extracted insights as shown in the following section.Example prompts and resultsThe following question and answer pairs refer the Student Age Distribution graph at the beginning of this post.Q: Which City has the highest number of students in the 13-15 age range?Q: Compare the student demographics between City 1 and City 4?In the original graph, the bars representing student counts lacked explicit numerical labels, which could make data interpretation challenging on a scale. However, with Amazon Q Business and its integration capabilities, this limitation can be overcome. By using Amazon Q Business to process these visualizations with Amazon Bedrock LLMs using the CDE feature, we’ve enabled a more interactive and insightful analysis experience. The service effectively extracts the contextual information embedded in the graph, even when explicit labels are absent. This powerful combination means that end users can ask questions about the visualization and receive responses based on the underlying data. Rather than being limited by what’s explicitly labeled in the graph, users can now explore deeper insights through natural language queries. This capability demonstrates how Amazon Q Business transforms static visualizations into queryable knowledge assets, enhancing the value of your existing data visualizations without requiring additional formatting or preparation work.Best practices for Amazon S3 CDE configurationWhen setting up CDE for your Amazon S3 data source, consider these best practices: to only process specific file types that need transformation. with Amazon CloudWatch to track processing errors and performance.Set appropriate timeout values for your Lambda functions, especially when processing large files.Consider incremental syncing to process only new or modified documents in your S3 bucket. to track which documents have been processed by CDE.Complete the following steps to clean up your resources:Go to the Amazon Q Business application and select  for users and groups.Delete the Amazon Q Business application.Delete the Lambda function.This solution demonstrates how combining Amazon Q Business, custom document enrichment, and Amazon Bedrock can transform static visualizations into queryable knowledge assets, significantly enhancing the value of existing data visualizations without additional formatting work. By using these powerful AWS services together, organizations can bridge the gap between visual information and actionable insights, enabling users to interact with different file types in more intuitive ways.

These diagrams serve as essential communication tools for stakeholders, documentation of compliance requirements, and blueprints for implementation teams. However, traditional diagramming approaches present several challenges: – Creating detailed architecture diagrams manually can take hours or even days – Learning specialized diagramming tools requires significant investment – Maintaining visual consistency across multiple diagrams is difficult – Keeping up with the latest AWS service icons and best practices challenging. – Updating diagrams as architectures evolve can become increasingly burdensomeAmazon Q Developer CLI with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) offers a streamlined approach to creating AWS architecture diagrams. By using generative AI through natural language prompts, architects can now generate professional diagrams in minutes rather than hours, while adhering to AWS best practices.In this post, we explore how to use Amazon Q Developer CLI with the AWS Diagram MCP and the AWS Documentation MCP servers to create sophisticated architecture diagrams that follow AWS best practices. We discuss techniques for basic diagrams and real-world diagrams, with detailed examples and step-by-step instructions.Amazon Q Developer CLI is a command line interface that brings the generative AI capabilities of Amazon Q directly to your terminal. Developers can interact with Amazon Q through natural language prompts, making it an invaluable tool for various development tasks.Developed by Anthropic as an open protocol, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way to connect AI models to virtually any data source or tool. Using a client-server architecture (as illustrated in the following diagram), the MCP helps developers expose their data through lightweight MCP servers while building AI applications as MCP clients that connect to these servers.The MCP uses a client-server architecture containing the following components: – A program or AI tool that requires access to data through the MCP protocol, such as Anthropic’s Claude Desktop, an integrated development environment (IDE), AWS MCP CLI, or other AI applications – Protocol clients that maintain one-to-one connections with server – Lightweight programs that expose capabilities through standardized MCP or act as tools – Local data sources such as databases and file systems, or external systems available over the internet through APIs (web APIs) that MCP servers can connect withAs announced in April 2025, MCP enables Amazon Q Developer to connect with specialized servers that extend its capabilities beyond what’s possible with the base model alone. MCP servers act as plugins for Amazon Q, providing domain-specific knowledge and functionality. The AWS Diagram MCP server specifically enables Amazon Q to generate architecture diagrams using the Python diagrams package, with access to the complete AWS icon set and architectural best practices.To implement this solution, you must have an AWS account with appropriate permissions and follow the steps below.Before you can start creating diagrams, you need to set up your environment with Amazon Q CLI, the AWS Diagram MCP server, and AWS Documentation MCP server. This section provides detailed instructions for installation and configuration.Install Amazon Q Developer CLIAmazon Q Developer CLI is available as a standalone installation. Complete the following steps to install it:Download and install Amazon Q Developer CLI. For instructions, see Using Amazon Q Developer on the command line.Verify the installation by running the following command: You should see output similar to the following: Amazon Q Developer CLI version 1.x.xConfigure Amazon Q CLI with your AWS credentials: Complete the following steps to set up your MCP servers:Install uv using the following command: Install Python 3.10 or newer: Install GraphViz for your operating system.Add the servers to your  file:{
  "mcpServers": {
    "awslabs.aws-diagram-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["awslabs.aws-diagram-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
      },
      "autoApprove": [],
      "disabled": false
    },
    "awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
      },
      "autoApprove": [],
      "disabled": false
    }
  }
}
Now, Amazon Q CLI automatically discovers MCP servers in the  file.Understanding MCP server toolsThe AWS Diagram MCP server provides several powerful tools: – Lists available icons from the diagrams package, organized by provider and service category – Provides example code for different types of diagrams (AWS, sequence, flow, class, and others) – Creates a diagram from Python code using the diagrams packageThe AWS Documentation MCP server provides the following useful tools: – Searches AWS documentation using the official AWS Documentation Search API – Fetches and converts AWS documentation pages to markdown format – Gets content recommendations for AWS documentation pagesThese tools work together to help you create accurate architecture diagrams that follow AWS best practices.Let’s verify that everything is working correctly by generating a simple diagram:The AWS Diagram MCP server supports several configuration options to customize your diagramming experience: – By default, diagrams are saved in a generated-diagrams directory in your current working directory. You can specify a different location in your prompts. – The default output format is PNG, but you can request other formats like SVG in your prompts. – You can specify colors, shapes, and other styling elements in your prompts.Now that our environment is set up, let’s create more diagrams.Create AWS architecture diagramsIn this section, we walk through the process of multiple AWS architecture diagrams using Amazon Q CLI with the AWS Diagram MCP server and AWS Documentation MCP server to make sure our requirements follow best practices.When you provide a prompt to Amazon Q CLI, the AWS Diagram and Documentation MCP servers complete the following steps:Interpret your requirements.Check for best practices on the AWS documentation.Generate Python code using the diagrams package.Execute the code to create the diagram.Return the diagram as an image.This process happens seamlessly, so you can focus on describing what you want rather than how to create it.AWS architecture diagrams typically include the following components: – AWS services and resources – Connections between nodes showing relationships or data flow – Logical groupings of nodes, such as virtual private clouds (VPCs), subnets, and Availability Zones – Text descriptions for nodes and connectionsLet’s create a diagram for a simple web application hosted on AWS. Enter the following prompt:Create a diagram for a simple web application with an Application Load Balancer, two EC2 instances, and an RDS database. Check for AWS documentation to ensure it adheres to AWS best practices before you create the diagramAmazon Q CLI will then list the needed AWS service icons using the  tool, and will use  with awslabsaws_diagram_mcp_server.You should receive an output with a description of the diagram created based on the prompt along with the location of where the diagram was saved.Amazon Q CLI will generate and display the diagram.The generated diagram shows the following key components:Multi-tier architectures separate applications into functional layers (presentation, application, and data) to improve scalability and security. We use the following prompt to create our diagram:Create a diagram for a three-tier web application with a presentation tier (ALB and CloudFront), application tier (ECS with Fargate), and data tier (Aurora PostgreSQL). Include VPC with public and private subnets across multiple AZs. Check for AWS documentation to ensure it adheres to AWS best practices before you create the diagram.The diagram shows the following key components:A presentation tier in public subnetsAn application tier in private subnetsA data tier in isolated private subnetsProper security group configurationsTraffic flow between tiersWe use the following prompt to create a diagram for a serverless architecture:Create a diagram for a serverless web application using API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3 for static website hosting. Include Cognito for user authentication and CloudFront for content delivery. Check for AWS documentation to ensure it adheres to AWS best practices before you create the diagram.The diagram includes the following key components:We use the following prompt to create a diagram for a data processing pipeline:Create a diagram for a data processing pipeline with components organized in clusters for data ingestion, processing, storage, and analytics. Include Kinesis, Lambda, S3, Glue, and QuickSight. Check for AWS documentation to ensure it adheres to AWS best practices before you create the diagram.The diagram organizes components into distinct clusters:Let’s explore some real-world architecture patterns and how to create diagrams for them using Amazon Q CLI with the AWS Diagram MCP server.Ecommerce platforms require scalable, resilient architectures to handle variable traffic and maintain high availability. We use the following prompt to create an example diagram:Create a diagram for an e-commerce platform with microservices architecture. Include components for product catalog, shopping cart, checkout, payment processing, order management, and user authentication. Ensure the architecture follows AWS best practices for scalability and security. Check for AWS documentation to ensure it adheres to AWS best practices before you create the diagram.The diagram includes the following key components:Intelligent document processing solutionWe use the following prompt to create a diagram for an intelligent document processing (IDP) architecture:Create a diagram for an intelligent document processing (IDP) application on AWS. Include components for document ingestion, OCR and text extraction, intelligent data extraction (using NLP and/or computer vision), human review and validation, and data output/integration. Ensure the architecture follows AWS best practices for scalability and security, leveraging services like S3, Lambda, Textract, Comprehend, SageMaker (for custom models, if applicable), and potentially Augmented AI (A2I). Check for AWS documentation related to intelligent document processing best practices to ensure it adheres to AWS best practices before you create the diagram.The diagram includes the following key components:Amazon API Gateway as the entry point for client applications, providing a secure and scalable interfaceMicroservices implemented as containers in ECS with Fargate, enabling flexible and scalable processingAmazon RDS databases for product catalog, shopping cart, and order data, providing reliable structured data storageAmazon ElastiCache for product data caching and session management, improving performance and user experienceAmazon CloudFront for content delivery and static assets from S3, optimizing global performanceAWS WAF for web application security, protecting against common web exploitsAWS Lambda functions for serverless microservice implementation, offering cost-effective scalingAmazon CloudWatch for monitoring and observability, providing insights into system performance and health.If you no longer need to use the AWS Cost Analysis MCP server with Amazon Q CLI, you can remove it from your configuration:Open your  file.Remove or comment out the MCP server entries.This will prevent the server from being loaded when you start Amazon Q CLI in the future.In this post, we explored how to use Amazon Q CLI with the AWS Documentation MCP and AWS Diagram MCP servers to create professional AWS architecture diagrams that adhere to AWS best practices referenced from official AWS documentation. This approach offers significant advantages over traditional diagramming methods: – Generate complex diagrams in minutes instead of hours – Make sure diagrams follow the same style and conventions – Automatically incorporate AWS architectural guidelines – Quickly modify diagrams through simple prompts – Check architectures against official AWS documentation and recommendationsAs you continue your journey with AWS architecture diagrams, we encourage you to deepen your knowledge by learning more about the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to understand how it enhances the capabilities of Amazon Q.

But real life doesn’t always follow that script. Many people who thrive in work and relationships often do so not because they’re the smartest in the room, but because they bring more to the table.Success today requires more than IQ. It requires emotional intelligence (EQ) and something deeper, which is your ability to lead with care and purpose, sometimes called LQ.Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba, agrees:Let’s break down these three forms of intelligence—and why all of them matter.
  
  
  IQ: The Intelligence Quotient
IQ is the traditional measure of intelligence. It includes logic, reasoning, analytical thinking, and problem-solving. These are the skills that help you ace exams and crack puzzles.But IQ is only one dimension of potential. You can be brilliant at math and still struggle to communicate or lead.IQ may help you learn fast, but it doesn’t guarantee you’ll thrive in a complex, collaborative world.
  
  
  EQ: The Emotional Quotient
EQ is your ability to manage emotions, both yours and others’. It's about empathy, self-awareness, communication, and resilience.In teams, EQ helps you navigate conflict, give feedback, and lead with clarity. In life, it helps you stay grounded under pressure.People with high EQ are the ones others trust and want to follow.LQ is less commonly talked about, but just as important. It represents your capacity to care about people, purpose, and long-term impact.In a world increasingly shaped by technology and automation, LQ is what makes us human. It's kindness in leadership, compassion in decisions, and meaning behind action.Machines can replicate logic. But they can’t replicate love.You need a balance of IQ, EQ, and LQ to thrive, not just professionally, but personally. helps you  and . helps you  and . helps you  and .The future belongs to those who integrate all three.Whether you’re building a startup, teaching a class, or supporting a friend; how you think, how you feel, and how you care all matter.The real intelligence of the future isn't just mental. It's emotional. It's human.Where do you think you’re strongest: IQ, EQ, or LQ?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI in Gaming: How does AI improve Intelligent enemy behavior in 3D games?</title><link>https://dev.to/vasundhara/ai-in-gaming-how-does-ai-improve-intelligent-enemy-behavior-in-3d-games-5bab</link><author>Vasundhara Infotech</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 12:51:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When enemies in a game surprise you with clever flanking moves, adapt to your strategies, or coordinate attacks like real squads, it’s not just great design — it’s artificial intelligence in action. As 3D games grow in scale and complexity, traditional enemy logic no longer satisfies players looking for immersive, reactive worlds. AI is stepping in to change the rules of engagement, giving rise to smarter enemies that think, learn, and challenge.A  designs, develops, and publishes video games using tools like Unity, Unreal Engine, and custom-built engines. These companies handle everything from game design, 3D modeling, and AI integration to multiplayer infrastructure and post-launch updates. At Vasundhara Infotech, we specialize in 3D game development powered by smart AI systems, creating immersive gameplay and intelligent enemy behavior.This article explores how AI is revolutionizing enemy behavior in 3D gaming, diving deep into the mechanics, technologies, and design philosophies behind these advancements. From dynamic pathfinding to neural networks and procedural learning, we’ll uncover how smarter enemies are reshaping the player experience and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in interactive entertainment.
  
  
  The Evolution of Enemy AI in Games
Enemy AI has come a long way since the days of predictable attack patterns and fixed patrol routes. In early 3D games, enemies operated using finite-state machines or simple if-else logic. These systems were effective but easily exploitable.As players became more experienced, developers recognized the need to craft more lifelike, adaptive, and unpredictable opponents. AI techniques have since evolved to include behavior trees, utility systems, machine learning, and goal-oriented action planning (GOAP). These methods allow enemies to react in real time, assess situations, and simulate intelligence.Key milestones in AI enemy evolution:DOOM (1993): Enemies navigated 2D maps with basic chase logicHalf-Life (1998): Introduced squad-based AI that could retreat and flankF.E.A.R. (2005): Pioneered adaptive enemy AI with cover mechanics and coordinated behaviorThe Last of Us Part II (2020): Enemies used dynamic group strategies, named allies, and adjusted tacticsEach generation of games has raised the bar for what’s expected in enemy intelligence, setting the stage for today’s AI-driven experiences.
  
  
  Why Smart Enemies Matter in 3D Games
Enemy intelligence isn’t just a technical flex — it’s critical to player immersion, engagement, and replayability. Smarter enemies create more satisfying challenges and make the game world feel alive.Impact of intelligent enemy AI:Keeps players on their toes with unpredictable encountersEncourages creativity and experimentation with tacticsIncreases emotional investment through reactive storytellingMakes each playthrough unique and dynamicWithout smart AI, even the most stunning 3D worlds can feel empty or repetitive. In contrast, well-executed AI creates emergent gameplay, where unscripted scenarios unfold based on player and enemy interactions.
  
  
  Core AI Techniques Enhancing 3D Enemies
Game developers leverage a combination of traditional and modern AI methods to build intelligent enemies that adapt and respond in real time.Behavior Trees
Behavior trees are one of the most widely used structures in modern game AI. They allow for modular, reusable decision-making systems where enemies evaluate conditions and perform actions based on priority.Use case:
In Assassin’s Creed, guards use behavior trees to patrol, investigate sounds, chase the player, or return to normal routines.Easy to expand with complex logicEfficient for performance-constrained environmentsGoal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP)GOAP is a decision-making system where enemies plan a sequence of actions to achieve specific goals based on world states and priorities.Example:
In F.E.A.R., AI enemies use GOAP to seek cover, flank the player, reload, and regroup dynamically.Enables adaptive, strategic decisions
Makes enemy actions feel deliberate and calculated
Navigation and Pathfinding
AI enemies must move through 3D environments in believable ways. Pathfinding systems like A* (A-star) and NavMesh allow enemies to navigate terrain, avoid obstacles, and reposition intelligently.Dynamic obstacle avoidance using raycasting
Climbing, swimming, or flying behavior
Real-time path recalculation during player pursuit
Real-world example:
Halo’s Covenant enemies dynamically use terrain, vehicles, and elevation to outmaneuver players.
  
  
  Machine Learning in Enemy AI
Machine learning introduces a new frontier in game AI where enemies can learn from players, adapt strategies over time, and improve without manual scripting.Reinforcement Learning
Enemies trained with reinforcement learning can adapt by trial and error. They receive rewards or penalties based on actions and evolve optimal strategies.Use case:
Ubisoft La Forge has experimented with reinforcement learning to develop AI agents that improve their tactics through thousands of simulations.Neural Networks
Neural networks allow AI to recognize patterns in gameplay, such as player movement or attack rhythms, and respond accordingly.In action:
In experimental AI mods, enemies trained with neural nets have learned to dodge, counter, and mimic player behaviors effectively.
  
  
  Limitations and considerations:
ML-based AI can be unpredictable or unbalanced
Requires significant training data and computing power
Often used in companion tools or procedural systems rather than production enemiesProcedural AI: Making Enemies That Evolve
Procedural generation isn’t limited to terrain or levels — it also extends to enemy behavior. Procedural AI enables the generation of unique enemy patterns, personalities, and responses every time you play.Enemies develop unique traits (e.g., aggression, stealth, loyalty)
Factions remember the player and change behavior over time
Bosses adapt movesets based on previous encounters
Case Study: Shadow of Mordor’s Nemesis SystemThis system allowed orc enemies to remember past fights, grow in rank, and develop rivalries. Combined with procedural animation and AI, it created deeply personalized and dynamic enemies.Makes player choices matter
Encourages replayability
Turns enemies into narrative elementsEmotional AI and Immersive Behavior
AI in 3D games isn’t just about tactics — it’s also about emotional expression and believability. Enemies that express fear, anger, confusion, or panic can create richer interactions and storytelling.How emotional AI enhances gameplay:Humanized enemies evoke empathy or moral tension
Dynamic voice lines react to player actions in real time
Group AI systems trigger panic when a leader fallsExample:
In The Last of Us Part II, enemies call each other by name, mourn fallen allies, and change behavior based on emotional states.This level of immersion elevates enemy AI beyond mechanics — it becomes a storytelling tool.Tools and Engines Supporting AI in 3D Game Development
Developers have access to robust engines and middleware that simplify AI implementation.Behavior Designer for creating visual behavior treesNavMesh for pathfinding in 3D spacesML-Agents for integrating machine learningBuilt-in support for behavior trees and blackboard systems
EQS (Environmental Query System) for AI awareness
MetaHuman AI for emotional and facial animation syncing
Third-party tools:These tools make it easier to create believable AI without reinventing the wheel.
  
  
  Challenges in Building Smarter Enemies
Creating advanced AI in games comes with its share of hurdles:Real-time AI must be lightweight enough to run on multiple platforms, including consoles and VR devices.Overly smart enemies can frustrate players. The challenge lies in making them believable, not unbeatable.AI decisions are harder to track and debug than scripted logic. Visualizers and logging systems become essential.Ethical and Narrative ImpactGames with emotional AI must consider how enemy behavior affects narrative tone and player psychology. Is an enemy that pleads for mercy appropriate in all genres?
  
  
  Actionable Tips for Game Developers
If you’re building smarter AI for 3D games, here are practical ways to start:Define Player Expectations
Decide what kind of intelligence makes sense for your genre and audience. Tactical enemies in a stealth game differ from chaotic mobs in a hack-and-slash.Start with Behavior Trees
They offer a scalable, modular way to implement decision-making that’s easy to iterate on.Layer Complexity Gradually
Introduce randomness, memory, and learning in stages to avoid unpredictable or buggy behavior.
Track player interaction with enemy AI to identify patterns, exploitations, and areas for improvement.
Test AI across skill levels and play styles to ensure fairness and challenge are well-balanced.
  
  
  The Future of Enemy AI in 3D Games
The future of AI in gaming points to even greater immersion and personalization.
Systems that anticipate player actions and evolve enemy behavior mid-game.AI-as-a-Service in Cloud Gaming
Enemy logic offloaded to cloud services, enabling deeper simulations without taxing local hardware.Voice-Interactive AI Enemies
Enemies that respond to voice commands, taunts, or strategies spoken by the player.
Imagine enemies that remember your actions across sequels or online worlds, creating persistent adversaries.These innovations signal a future where enemy AI isn’t just a feature — it’s a character, a storyteller, and an adversary worth remembering.

  ChatGPT Humanizer: AI Detection Scores
Average score on all AI detectors: : ChatGPT got an average score of 72.06% human in my tests.: It totally fooled Originality AI and QuillBot AI detectors. Even Undetectable.ai had trouble with it.Just notice that the sample size is small, and the gap to the next tool wasn’t big.The second-best humanizer is Walter Writes AI.
  
  
  Walter Writes AI human scores
Average score on all AI detectors: 70.31%: Walter Writes AI got a 70.31% average human score on my tests.: It totally fooled Originality AI and QuillBot AI detectors. Even Winston AI had trouble with it.The third-best AI humanizer is Grubby AI.Average score on all AI detectors: : This tool got a 61.65% average human score on my tests.: It completely fooled Originality AI and mostly fooled QuillBot.If you’re in a hurry, I hope you liked it. But if you have some spare time, feel free to stick around.Towards the end, I will discuss the truth about AI detection/humanization. I will create a killer prompt for humanizing with ChatGPT and more.How I Evaluated the AI Content DetectorsIdeally, a perfect AI detector would assign a , indicating the content is entirely AI-produced. Of course, no detector is flawless, so the results weren’t exactly zero, but most were close.
  
  
  AI-generated content samples' human scores
Total Combined Average (all 16 values):The average human score was 6.88%.In other words, the detectors judged that about 6.88% of the text appeared human-written, while 93.12% was identified as AI-generated.This  will serve as our reference point to compare the tools.If a score is much higher than 6.88%, it suggests that the AI humanization process had some effect.For an AI humanizer to be considered successful, the score should ideally approach 100%.With that reference in place, here are the results of running the same samples through AI humanizers and then scanning them again with detectors.ChatGPT needs no lengthy introduction, so we’ll skip straight to the details.To test how well ChatGPT can humanize AI content, I followed this process:Rewrote each sample using ChatGPT.Ran the rewritten text through the AI detectors.Below is what the most popular detectors reported:
  
  
  ChatGPT Humanizer: AI Detection Scores
Average score on all AI detectors:  = Fully human-writtenWinston AI still detected the text as mainly AI.Originality AI was completely fooled.QuillBot was also fully deceived.Undetectable.ai remained partially unconvinced.On average, the human score increased to .This is a substantial improvement over the 6.88% baseline.Still, this result is less than ideal. Ideally, you’d expect the score to be near 99% or higher.Overall, ChatGPT produced text that was a little more than halfway human-like—far from perfect, but among the better options.ChatGPT is available free of charge within certain usage limits. If you only use it for content humanization, you might not need to pay.Here’s a quick overview of the pricing tiers:Limited access to GPT-4o, OpenAI o4-mini, and advanced research toolsRestrictions on file uploads, data analysis, image generation, and voice modeCode editing in the ChatGPT macOS desktop appAbility to use custom GPTsHigher limits for messages, uploads, analysis, and image creationEnhanced voice mode with video and screensharingAccess to GPT-4.5 preview, GPT-4.1, and additional reasoning modelsUse of OpenAI o3, o4-mini, and o4-mini-highCreate and manage custom GPTs, projects, and workflowsEarly access to new featuresUnlimited access to all reasoning models, including GPT-4oUnlimited advanced voice, video, and screensharingAccess to OpenAI o3-pro with increased compute powerExtended deep research capabilitiesSora video generation accessPreviews of Operator and Codex agentsWalter Writes AI is a tool designed to make AI-generated text sound more human.It’s simple to use: sign up, paste your AI text, and click “Humanize.”The platform will produce a rewritten version intended to appear more human-like.But does it actually work? Can it consistently fool AI detectors? Let’s find out.To evaluate Walter Writes AI, I followed this process:Humanized each sample with Walter AI.Ran the humanized texts through AI detectors.Collected and averaged the scores.Here are the results reported by the most popular detectors:
  
  
  Walter Writes AI human scores
Average score on all AI detectors: 70.31% = Fully human-writtenWinston AI still detected the content as mainly AI.Originality AI was completely fooled.QuillBot was also fully deceived.Undetectable.ai remained partially skeptical.When averaging the human scores, This is significantly higher than the 6.88% baseline with no humanization.However, this performance is still disappointing.Essentially, the tool only successfully humanized the text about 70% of the time—far too unreliable.Ideally, the score should fall between 99.5% and 100% to justify using it, but here it’s just 70%.
  
  
  Walter Writes AI vs. ChatGPT
Given Walter Writes AI’s underwhelming results, I decided to see how ChatGPT would perform in comparison.I repeated the same process: humanized the same four text samples using ChatGPT, then tested them with AI detectors.
  
  
  ChatGPT Humanizer: AI Detection Scores
Average score on all AI detectors: Winston AI again detected the content as mainly AI.Originality AI was mostly fooled.QuillBot was fully deceived.Undetectable.ai was mostly fooled.The average human score came out to For reference, Walter AI achieved only 70.31%.In short, ChatGPT did a slightly better job at making AI content appear human-written.Even better, ChatGPT is free to use.By contrast, Walter Writes AI offers only 300 free words of humanization.Bottom line: I’d pick ChatGPT over Walter Writes AI.

Here are my results.To test Grubby AI, I followed this process:Here’s what the most popular detectors reported:Average score on all AI detectors:  = Fully human-writtenWinston AI was not fooled at all.Originality AI was completely deceived.QuillBot was mostly convinced.Undetectable.ai remained skeptical.On average, the human score came out to This is far above the 6.88% baseline without humanization.Still, 61.56% is extremely low. It means Grubby AI failed nearly half the time to make text look human.Ideally, you’d want a score between 99.5% and 100%, not just over 60%.On top of that, the free plan is very limited: you can only humanize one short piece before being prompted to pay.Bottom line: Grubby AI doesn’t work well.Since Grubby AI performed poorly, I wanted to see how ChatGPT compared.I repeated the exact same steps but used ChatGPT to humanize the samples.Then I tested the results with the same detectors.
  
  
  ChatGPT Humanizer: AI Detection Scores
Average score on all AI detectors: Winston AI still recognized most of the text as AI-generated.Originality AI was mostly fooled.QuillBot was completely fooled.Undetectable.ai was mostly convinced.The average human score was Compare this to Grubby AI’s 61.56%.Clearly, ChatGPT did a far better job at making content look human.Plus, ChatGPT is free and allows unlimited usage.In short: I’d use ChatGPT over Grubby AI every time.

Here are my results.To evaluate GPTHuman, I followed this process:Here’s what the most popular detectors reported:
  
  
  GPTHuman AI detector scores
Total Combined Average (all 16 values): = Fully human-writtenWinston AI still flagged the content as AI.Originality AI was completely fooled.QuillBot was also fooled.Undetectable.ai was not fully convinced.The average human score came to While this is much higher than the 6.88% baseline, it’s still poor.A score around 60% means the tool fails almost half the time.Ideally, you’d want results above 99% to consider it reliable.Because GPTHuman’s results were disappointing, I decided to test the same samples with ChatGPT.I followed the same steps but used ChatGPT to rephrase the text.

That’s why I was curious to see if it could match ChatGPT in making AI content appear human.It’s exactly the same prompt I used when testing ChatGPT as a humanizer.If you’d like to try it yourself, you can sign up for Claude, paste in the prompt, and provide some AI-generated text.Let’s see if Claude can outperform ChatGPT (or any of the other top humanization tools).To test Claude AI, I took these steps:Here’s what the most popular detectors reported:Total Combined Average (all 16 values): = Entirely AI-generated = Entirely human-writtenWinston AI detected the text as AI.Originality AI was mostly fooled.QuillBot was not very convinced.Undetectable.ai wasn’t convinced either.Overall, the average human score was This is higher than the 6.88% baseline with no humanization.However, 59.38% is still very weak. Even the better tools on this list fell short of the 99% range.Claude doesn’t reliably disguise AI content—it still looks like AI about half the time.It’s an obvious comparison: how does Claude stack up against ChatGPT?I repeated the same process, but used ChatGPT to rewrite the four text samples and then ran them through the same detectors.Here were the ChatGPT results:

One appealing feature is the free trial with no signup required.To use it, simply visit their site. No registration is needed.Paste your text into the editor and click “Humanize.”But does it really work? Can a free tool reliably make AI text sound human? Let’s find out.To evaluate HumanizeAI, I did the following:Here’s what the most popular detectors reported:

(20,000 words)Undetectable by AI detectorsNo random or awkward phrasing (50,000 words) (150,000 words)After testing all these tools with a basic prompt, I wanted to see what would happen if I created a more carefully crafted prompt in ChatGPT.This time, I told ChatGPT to imitate my personal writing style and used a blog post I had written myself as a reference.Surely that approach should work better, right?I asked it to match my tone and style exactly.
  
  
  ChatGPT AI human scores with improved prompt
Total Combined Average (all 16 values):The average human score dropped to 47.5%.That’s significantly lower than the 70%+ score I got earlier with a simpler prompt.Ironically, improving the prompt actually made the humanization worse.Maybe it was just random luck (AI outputs are unpredictable), but it still proves how inconsistent these tools are.Whatever the reason, this confirms how difficult it is to “humanize” AI text reliably.If you try random tools or prompts and your score isn’t above 99%, you already know the technology isn’t dependable.So why are AI humanizers generally ineffective?Most of these tools are just wrappers around ChatGPT or similar language models. There’s no secret algorithm or special anti-detector technology. What they really do is:Take your AI-generated text.Add prompt instructions (like “Rewrite this to sound human”).Return a rephrased version.It’s blunt, but that’s the truth.And because AI is rewriting AI, it still ends up sounding artificial.AI detectors look for telltale signs: repetition, unnatural flow, too-perfect grammar, and lack of randomness. Even with rephrasing, these traits often remain because the underlying process is still AI.Plus, many popular tools don’t train on real human writing—they only rephrase. That might occasionally fool a detector, but not consistently. And when it does, the content often sounds awkward or low quality.You might wonder: If they don’t work well, why are there so many?It’s not always about building the best product. It’s about meeting demand.Right now,  is a high-traffic keyword.You can see that from the above Semrush search traffic report. It suggests there are hundreds of thousands of people searching for those every month.In the US alone, there are over 246,000 Google searches every month for “AI humanizer.”That’s mostly students, freelancers, and SEO professionals trying to bypass detectors.Where there’s search volume, there’s a product. It doesn’t matter whether it works. If people look for it, someone will sell it.And most users don’t test the results like I did. They paste in text, see a few words changed, and assume it’s good enough. That alone is enough to drive subscriptions and upgrades.The developers know it’s imperfect. But if the demand is there, they build it anyway.That’s the business model.And honestly, I don’t hate it. Most business works that way—someone builds a product that isn’t great, uses the revenue to create something better later.Just be aware this is how it operates.If you want to beat AI detectors, you don’t need a humanizer.Sounds obvious, but it’s the truth.The only consistent way to pass detection is to create content only a human could write—based on real experience.Not regurgitated facts or generic fluff, but actual expertise.Real insights from doing the workDetails only an expert would knowSpecifics ChatGPT can’t inventCheck out some of my own posts.They aren’t perfect writing.But they get read because they save people time and share my firsthand results. That’s what really matters.This content doesn’t just pass AI detectors—it makes the web better. It builds trust and authority.Yes, it takes work. But it’s supposed to.Everyone has access to the same AI tools. If you’re just publishing another generic post, it won’t stand out. Not because it’s unethical—but because it doesn’t work.AI detectors can be tricked easily. But even if they weren’t, it wouldn’t fix the core problem.AI-generated content just feels artificial.When you use a “humanizer,” you’re not creating something new—you’re just making the text slightly less obvious.These tools try to game the system: tweaking sentences, adding randomness, breaking up patterns to raise the “human score.”Sometimes it works. Often it doesn’t.Remember: you don’t win by blending in. You win by adding value. If you don’t have something original to say, it’s better not to say it.Personally, I don’t use AI humanizers. I don’t bother with AI detectors either.Not because I’m trying to take the high ground—because they’re pointless.Even if they worked perfectly, they wouldn’t help.It’s about creating content that matters.Before AI blew up, freelancers were already writing shallow blog posts on topics they barely understood—just recycled fluff.AI just speeds up that process. But the end result is still unhelpful.Gaming the system doesn’t work. Search engines are too smart. Readers are too smart. You might pass a detector for a moment, but it won’t matter if your content is bad.The only strategy that truly works is this:👉 Write about what you know.That’s the whole playbook.That’s everything I have to say about AI content humanization.If you want to recreate this experiment yourself, here are the resources:

Agentic AI encompasses software entities endowed with autonomous, goal-driven behavior, capable of decision-making and adaptation without continuous human oversight. Unlike traditional AI systems that respond passively to static inputs, agentic systems dynamically interact with their environment, internal states, and other agents.Generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), provides the cognitive backbone for agentic behavior. These models enable natural language understanding, reasoning, and creative synthesis, empowering agents to generate plans, communicate, and learn from interactions.The progression from early rule-based bots and single-use AI tools to sophisticated multi-agent systems has accelerated with breakthroughs in LLMs, reinforcement learning, and distributed architectures. Today’s enterprise deployments feature:Hierarchical multi-agent frameworks, where specialized agents collaborate under orchestration layers or “super-agents” to solve complex, cross-domain problems.
Advanced communication protocols enabling seamless agent-to-agent coordination and knowledge sharing.
Integration into enterprise workflows and data ecosystems, ensuring agents operate on accurate, governed data and produce actionable outcomes.
This evolution reflects a shift from isolated AI silos to autonomous ecosystems that continuously optimize and innovate across business functions. For software engineers and AI practitioners, mastering these concepts is critical. Participating in an Agentic AI course in Mumbai or engaging with best Agentic AI courses online can accelerate understanding of these architectures and their practical applications.Modern Frameworks, Tools, and Deployment Strategies

It’s no surprise, then, that as a software engineer, I’ve always been interested in Capture The Flag (CTF) cybersecurity challenges. In these challenges, you need to find a solution (hack) to retrieve a secret string hidden somewhere. This could be in a website, social media, assembly code, images, or any medium that can conceal information. These challenges require a broad range of knowledge, particularly in computer science and software engineering, but also creativity and inventiveness. However, I never dared to try because, in my mind, CTFs were reserved for the elite: the seasoned hackers with skills far beyond my own.Now, at 35, life is busier than ever. I recently became a father, and finding time for new pursuits feels almost impossible. But the itch to finally try a CTF remained. My main obstacles? A lack of time and the belief that I didn’t have enough knowledge.That’s when generative AI, like ChatGPT, Gemini, Github Copilot sparked an idea: what if I tried hacking with AI as my sidekick? To my surprise, not only were CTF challenges more accessible than I’d imagined, but AI assistants also helped me save precious time by accelerating my learning and problem-solving. Thanks to this partnership, I completed the 404 CTF — one of France’s most famous competitions — and finished in a respectable 165th place out of more than 2,800 participants.In this article, I’ll share how I used AI to supercharge my hacking journey, the tips I picked up along the way, and where the limits of AI became clear. As a disclaimer before diving in, while I used GitHub Copilot for this article, other technologies like Cursor, Claude, and similar tools are equally valid choices. You can even use several of them simultaneously, the end goal remains the same.
  
  
  💬 Prompts I used the most and how I used them

  
  
  Explain me the purpose of XXX?
GitHub Copilot is an excellent assistant that integrates seamlessly with VS Code. Microsoft’s plugin provides a powerful interface where you can query specific lines of code or use a dedicated console to focus Copilot’s attention on particular files or directories.Since most CTF challenges begin with analyzing files, Copilot proved to be a perfect investigation tool. My typical workflow starts by asking Copilot to analyze the project, explain its purpose, and map out the function of each file. Then, I examine each file in detail, and whenever I encounter something unfamiliar, I ask Copilot to explain specific sections."Copilot, could you explain the purpose of this project? Could you describe the function of each file and directory?" — prompt exampleFor instance, one web security challenge included an nginx configuration file. While I don't regularly work with nginx configurations, by asking Copilot to explain specific instructions, I could quickly understand their purpose without leaving VS Code. This allowed me to learn just enough to efficiently identify potential attack vectors.An important consideration is that files aren't always immediately readable by Copilot (or any AI assistant). Sometimes you need to be creative with file formatting. For example, when challenges provide binary files, Copilot can't interpret them directly. The solution is to export the binary's hexadecimal or assembly code to a text file. This conversion makes the content accessible to Copilot for analysis. While this approach is valuable for initial investigation, sometime specialized tools are necessary for deeper analysis. In my last example, after the initial examination with Copilot, I had to switch to BinaryNinja for a more thorough investigation of the binary file.Another interesting example involves analyzing a pcapng file containing network captures. The challenge was to discover how a malicious user extracted a password from numerous network packets. While this file wasn't readable in VS Code and required Wireshark for viewing, it contained an overwhelming amount of data, including many irrelevant packets. To effectively analyze such data with an AI assistant, you first need to filter out the relevant packets (in my case, HTTP packets) through Wireshark and then export them to a more comprehensible format like JSON. It's essential to perform this initial filtering step, as otherwise, the AI assistant won't be able to analyze the data effectively due to the sheer volume of information.
  
  
  Do you see any security issues or unusual elements?
After analyzing the structure of a challenge, there are times when I don't immediately spot relevant issues. In such scenarios, I ask Copilot to identify potential security vulnerabilities. Often, Copilot suggests multiple issues that provide a good foundation for starting to hack. This is where your skills as a hacker/developer become crucial, you need to evaluate and filter these suggestions, identifying which are viable and which aren't. You also need to find synergies and discover exploits that Copilot didn't explicitly mention. Frequently, challenges require exploiting multiple security vulnerabilities in combination rather than just a single issue."Copilot, do you see any security issue or unusual elements in route.py? Do you see any deprecated dependencies?" — prompt exampleFor example, in one web security challenge from the 404CTF, solving it required combining multiple vulnerabilities that Copilot helped identify such as issues in both the backend and proxy cache server. Out of the various potential problems Copilot pointed out, I had to analyze, select, and connect the relevant ones to reach the solution and extract the flag. This experience shows how AI can accelerate the investigative process, but still requires human intuition to piece everything together.Finally, when Copilot identifies vulnerabilities, the method of exploitation isn't always obvious. You can continue the conversation with your AI assistant by asking how to exploit these vulnerabilities and requesting more detailed information. Don't hesitate to ask about specific tools or request step-by-step instructions for executing your hack. Those questions are always instructive and provides valuable learning opportunities."Copilot, what's a smuggle request and how can I do it ? Can you guide me step-by-step?" — prompt example
  
  
  Write a Python script to accomplish XXX?
The analysis process generates numerous ideas. Generally, these ideas require some coding to create a proof of concept for a vulnerability. When you're unsure where to start and time is limited, asking an AI to write a small code snippet can be valuable. Copilot can adapt to your repository structure and generate files in the appropriate locations with the requested code. While not essential, this approach saves time.One crucial point to notice is that you need to be precise with your requirements; otherwise, the generated code may not align with your needs. Don't hesitate to specify the programming language, preferred libraries, and your desired outcome. The goal isn't to obtain perfect code, but rather to get something you can easily customize to suit your specific needs."Copilot, can you write a Python script with pwntools that connects to [IP] and [PORT], receives two numbers, adds them, and sends back the result." — prompt example
  
  
  🔄 It's an iterative process
This process is often iterative. Basically, after the global analysis, I enter a loop where I filter the data I have, analyze it, ask questions, inquire about security issues, and reflect on the results. Then, I reiterate again and again until I start to assemble pieces of the puzzle to solve the challenge.
  
  
  💔 What's the drawback of using AI for a CTF
Using AI allows me to learn quickly, but it's exhausting. While you can access specific information and documentation faster than ever, it involves processing a lot of knowledge in a short time. You need to read extensively, maintain focus, and review every suggestion and generated code snippet. It's a different style of work. Counter-intuitively, working with an AI assistant actually consumes more energy than working alone. While one might think that having a computer do the thinking would require less effort, the reality is quite different.Working without an AI assistant is a steady hike; working with one is a sprint - you move faster, but it takes a lot more energy.A legitimate question might be: is using AI cheating in a CTF? For the easiest challenges, like the Intro or Easy levels in 404CTF, AI can sometimes hand you the solution on a silver platter. But as soon as you move up to Medium or harder, the problems get too complex for Copilot or any AI to just solve for you.That's why I don't see AI as a cheat code. In reality, it's just one tool among many, like the ones real hackers use to break systems in the wild. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't, and it rarely cracks the tough challenges on its own. In cybersecurity, there are no shortcuts, just different methods and tools to reach your goal. And honestly, no hacker would refuse a useful tool just because it feels "unfair."AI mostly raises the floor, not the ceiling. It helps beginners level up faster, but expert won't suddenly become stronger thanks to AI alone.
  
  
  AI can be censored for certain types of questions
Sometimes I encountered limitations with Copilot, likely due to ethical considerations. When attempting to create attacks, Copilot sometimes refuses to provide assistance. As a workaround, I needed to specify in my initial prompt that I was working in a CTF context. However, even with this clarification, Copilot might still censor certain responses.It's amusing to realize that you sometimes have to find creative ways to "hack" Copilot itself. It reminds me of Asimov's novels, where clever loopholes are found in the famous three laws of robotics. In a similar way, you need to think outside the box to get Copilot to do what you want.
  
  
  AI can push you to do some unsecure actions
While asking Copilot how to exploit vulnerabilities, I sometimes received recommendations for tools whose safety I wasn't entirely confident about. When investigating these tools on GitHub, regardless of their quality, they often had few stars, indicating limited usage, and were frequently unmaintained with commits dating back years. This didn't inspire much confidence.For example, when I was looking for a password generator based on social knowledge, Copilot recommended tools like pypasswords. While I won't judge this tool's quality, it may be good but pypasswords' last commit was 5 years ago and the project only had 1 star. Without looking in more details, it can be dangerous to install such a library.That's why, as personal advice, I recommend not blindly trusting what your AI suggests when it comes to running commands or installing libraries. Always verify what you're about to execute.
  
  
  AI can lead you down the wrong path
I think it's part of the experience, but I've lost count of the times Copilot has hallucinated issues where there were none, or assured me everything was fine when there was actually a subtle problem. I once spent hours trying to craft a smuggling request that turned out to be impossible - simply because Copilot suggested it might work. But as I mentioned earlier, this is a valuable lesson: don't blindly trust everything your AI suggests.That said, I'd put this into perspective based on your goals with CTFs. If your aim is to learn new skills, sometimes following the wrong leads can be incredibly educational.Using AI to solve CTFs is fun, and I strongly encourage you to try it. You'll sharpen your AI skills for analysis and programming while learning extensively about specific domains. Personally, I focused mainly on web security since I specialize in web development. The knowledge I gained is valuable and helps me spot issues I might have missed before. It's all about honing your skills.At Doctolib, we actively encourage software engineers to embrace AI, not to work less, but to free up time for higher-value tasks that truly matter. This philosophy mirrors exactly what I experienced during my CTF journey.Just as I used AI to accelerate my learning and problem-solving in cybersecurity challenges, at Doctolib, we leverage tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude Code to streamline routine coding tasks, accelerate debugging, and enhance code exploration. The goal isn't to replace our expertise, but to augment it allowing us to focus on architectural decisions, complex problem-solving, and innovative solutions that improve healthcare for millions of patients.Whether it's analyzing nginx configurations in a CTF challenge or refactoring critical healthcare infrastructure at Doctolib, AI serves as an amplifier of human intelligence. The key lesson from both contexts remains the same: AI is most powerful when it enhances human judgment, not when it replaces it.Thank you for reading.

But in future? We can do better.Manual KYC verification not only slowed the onboarding process but also created friction for users. So, I decided to take matters into my own hands.
In this blog, I’ll walk you through how I built an Auto KYC (Know Your Customer) Verification System using a combination of OpenCV, Tesseract, and DeepFace (FaceNet) to create a faster, smarter, and secure identity check process.
  
  
  What is KYC and Why Automate It?
KYC (Know Your Customer) is a standard process in fintech and crowdfunding to verify a user’s identity. Traditionally, this involves:Uploading a valid government-issued document (e.g., citizenship, license)Waiting for a human reviewer to verify bothThis manual method is time-consuming, costly, and prone to human error. Automating it not only reduces overhead but also enhances user experience.
  
  
  The Problem with Manual KYC
The typical KYC process is slow:Users upload their details, documents, and selfies.A human manually cross-checks everything.It takes hours or even days.
That doesn’t scale — especially when users expect instant access. I wanted to create a system where users could:Upload their personal details, citizenship/ID image, and selfieLet the system automatically verify:Are the text details valid and extracted from the document?
Does the face on the document match the selfie?
  
  
  Can Emerging Technologies Solve This?
Manual KYC processes have always been resource-heavy — requiring human verification, document handling, and judgment-based approval. But in an era where AI and automation are becoming mainstream, there’s a clear opportunity to streamline identity verification using emerging technologies.That’s where Computer Vision comes in.By leveraging OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and Facial Recognition, we can intelligently extract and verify identity data from uploaded documents and photos — with minimal human intervention.
Modern open-source libraries like Tesseract, OpenCV, and DeepFace make it possible to:Automatically read and extract text from scanned ID cardsDetect faces from document photos and selfiesCompare facial features to ensure that the same person is present in both
  
  
  How My System Aims to Solve This
The system I’m building aims to do just that — with a workflow that looks like this:Their basic personal information (e.g., name, DOB)Uses Tesseract to extract text from the documentApplies OpenCV to detect and crop faces from both imagesUses DeepFace (with the FaceNet model) to compare the selfie and document photoCross-verifies the form data with OCR-extracted data and the selfie with the ID face
  
  
  3. Based on this, it either:
Automatically approves the KYC requestFlags the submission for manual reviewThis intelligent approach reduces verification time from hours to seconds without compromising trust or security.Here’s what I used to implement my KYC automation pipeline:OpenCV — For image pre-processing and face detectionTesseract OCR — To extract text from ID cardsDeepFace (FaceNet) — For comparing the ID photo with a selfieSpring Boot + ReactJS — Backend and frontend integrationPostgreSQL — Storing KYC metadata
  
  
  Step-by-Step: How Auto KYC Works
Let’s break down the flow of the auto-verification process:
  
  
  1. User Uploads KYC Document & Selfie
We allow users to upload:An image of their citizenship cardA selfie
These are sent to the backend in a multipart/form-data request, where the verification logic begins.
  
  
  2. Preprocessing with OpenCV
Before any recognition or comparison, I apply preprocessing:import cv2

img = cv2.imread('citizenship.jpg')
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
denoised = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (5, 5), 0)

Reduces noise
Increases OCR and face detection accuracy
  
  
  3. Text Extraction via Tesseract
Once the image is preprocessed, I pass it to Tesseract OCR to extract information like:import pytesseract

text = pytesseract.image_to_string(denoised)
print(text)

  
  
  4. Face Detection and Cropping
Using OpenCV’s Haar cascades or DNN modules, I detect and crop the face from both:import cv2

face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5)

Get the largest face
x, y, w, h = max(faces, key=lambda f: f[2] * f[3])
face_crop = doc_img[y:y+h, x:x+w]

 Resize slightly larger (helps DeepFace)
face_resized = cv2.resize(face_crop, (224, 224), interpolation=cv2.INTER_CUBIC)
This step is critical because FaceNet requires clean face crops to compute accurate embeddings.
  
  
  5. Face Matching with DeepFace (FaceNet)
Here comes the magic.
I use DeepFace’s FaceNet backend to generate embeddings for both cropped faces, and then calculate the cosine distance between them.from deepface import DeepFace
result = DeepFace.verify(img1_path="id_face.jpg", img2_path="selfie.jpg", model_name='Facenet')
print(result)
If the distance < threshold (e.g. 0.4), the faces matchThis means the selfie is likely from the same person as on the IDText extracted correctly (e.g. name, citizenship number)Face match confidence is highMatch name from OCR with the user-entered full name
Then, the user is marked as KYC verified.Some users uploaded blurry or low-light images. Fixing this with CLAHE and adaptive thresholding helped improve OCR and face detection.Tesseract isn’t perfect — especially with fonts used in Nepali citizenship cards. I built a fallback where users can manually edit extracted fields before submission.All images are encrypted and stored temporarily
Verification happens in memory — nothing permanent unless KYC succeeds
Sensitive data (like extracted text) is masked during logging
HTTPS and JWT authentication for every KYC APISome exciting upgrades I’m planning:Liveness Detection: To prevent photo spoofingNepali OCR: To support native-script ID cardsThis auto-verification system:Reduced verification time from hours to secondsImproved accuracy by combining textual and facial matchingAllowed scaling to hundreds of verifications daily without human intervention
And most importantly, users loved the instant onboarding experience.
  
  
  Real-World Use Cases of Face Recognition
Face recognition goes far beyond just KYC. It’s already transforming multiple industries with practical and impactful applications:Banking & FinTech
Used for remote KYC, fraud detection, and secure account recovery.No need of physical appearance in banks and finTech companies for kyc update.E-commerce
Enables secure logins, customer identity verification, and personalized shopping experiences.Healthcare
Helps in patient check-ins, record matching, and reducing administrative overhead.Travel
Facilitates faster airport check-ins, e-passport systems, and border control automation.Security & Surveillance
Provides real-time face detection and matching for access control and public safety.Face-Verified Smart Card Attendance System 
student taps their ID card (RFID/NFC) to mark attendance, but the system also uses face recognition to verify that the person tapping the card is the card’s actual owner.
  
  
  How It Fits My Use Case (Crowdfunding Platform)
In the context of my crowdfunding platform, facial recognition is a game-changer. Here’s how:Prevents fake campaigns and fraudulent actors from misusing the platform.Ensures each user is genuinely who they claim to be by matching ID and selfie.Speeds up user onboarding with instant verification, no manual review bottlenecks.Builds trust between donors and campaign creators — especially crucial when money and social impact are involved.
In short, face recognition doesn’t just check an identity — it helps protect the entire system’s integrity.Building an auto KYC system was one of the most technically rewarding parts of my crowdfunding platform. It wasn’t just about writing code — It was about building trust at scale, solving real problems, saving user time,making onboarding seamless, and ensuring security in a world moving faster every day.If you’re building anything in fintech, banking, or even decentralized apps — I’d highly recommend exploring automated KYC with OpenCV + OCR + Face Verification.Let the code do the boring work — and let humans focus on what matters.If you’re working on something similar — or have ideas to improve OCR accuracy, face matching, or KYC workflows — I’d love to chat!
