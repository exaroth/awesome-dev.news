  Beyond Static Charts: Crafting Intelligent, AI-Driven Data Visualizations with Python
The landscape of data analysis is undergoing a profound transformation, moving beyond traditional static charts to embrace dynamic, intelligent visualizations powered by Artificial Intelligence. This exciting intersection, identified as a key trend for 2024, is redefining how we interact with and interpret data, offering unprecedented opportunities for automated insights, predictive capabilities, and enhanced decision-making. AI-driven data visualizations are increasingly pivotal in extracting and presenting complex insights from vast datasets, leveraging machine learning algorithms to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies that might otherwise be overlooked by human analysis. This approach significantly enhances decision-making processes across various sectors, from healthcare to business analytics, by automating and refining the visualization process, making data interpretation more efficient, accurate, and insightful.At its core, AI-driven visualization integrates machine learning algorithms directly into the data pipeline. Before data even reaches the visualization stage, AI can play a crucial role in data cleaning, feature engineering, and pattern recognition. Algorithms such as clustering (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN), regression (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression), and anomaly detection (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) can preprocess and enrich datasets. This pre-analysis allows visualizations to highlight significant findings, predict future trends, or pinpoint unusual activities, transforming raw data into actionable intelligence. For instance, AI can automatically segment customer demographics or identify potential fraudulent transactions, allowing visualizations to immediately draw attention to these critical areas.
  
  
  Python Libraries for AI-Powered Visualizations
Python, with its rich ecosystem of libraries, stands at the forefront of this revolution, offering powerful tools to integrate AI models with sophisticated visualization techniques.Matplotlib/Seaborn with Scikit-learnFor foundational AI-driven visualizations,  and  remain indispensable, especially when combined with  for machine learning tasks. These libraries allow for the direct visualization of AI model outputs.Consider visualizing clusters found by a K-Means algorithm on a scatter plot:Similarly, visualizing a regression line after a linear regression model provides clear insights into the relationship between variables:Plotly/Dash for Interactive AI DashboardsFor building interactive dashboards where users can dynamically adjust AI model parameters and observe real-time visualization updates,  and  are excellent choices. Plotly excels at creating sophisticated, interactive charts, while Dash allows you to build entire web applications around these visualizations with minimal code. For example, one could create a time-series forecast visualization where the forecast changes based on user input for future variables, powered by a simple ARIMA or Prophet model in the backend.Generative AI for Visualization (More Advanced)While still an emerging area, generative AI models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) hold fascinating potential for visualization. These models could be used to explore novel visualization layouts, generate synthetic datasets for testing visualization systems, or even create "what-if" scenarios for predictive models, offering entirely new perspectives on data. This area is rapidly evolving, promising more intuitive and contextually rich visualizations.
  
  
  Practical Use Cases and Examples
AI-driven data visualizations find applications across diverse industries, transforming how businesses and researchers gain insights.Predictive Analytics Visualization: Visualize sales forecasts, stock price predictions, or customer churn probabilities. Interactive charts can show projected trends, confidence intervals, and the impact of different input variables on predictions.Anomaly Detection Visualization: Highlight unusual patterns in data, such as fraudulent transactions, system errors, or network intrusions. Visual cues, like distinct colors or shapes, can draw immediate attention to outliers identified by AI algorithms, enabling rapid response.Sentiment Analysis Visualization: Create dynamic word clouds or bar charts showing sentiment distribution from text data (e.g., customer reviews, social media posts). AI-powered sentiment analysis categorizes text, and visualizations then aggregate and display these sentiments, revealing public opinion or customer satisfaction trends.
  
  
  Challenges and Ethical Considerations
Despite the immense potential, AI-driven data visualization is not without its challenges. A primary concern is the potential for biases embedded within AI models to be amplified and visually misrepresented. If the training data for an AI model is biased, the insights derived and subsequently visualized will also carry that bias, potentially leading to unfair or inaccurate conclusions. Therefore, transparency and interpretability in AI-driven visuals are paramount. Users must understand how the AI model arrived at its conclusions and how those conclusions are being represented visually. Ethical visualization practices, including being transparent about data sources and ensuring visualizations do not mislead or misrepresent data, are crucial.The future of AI-driven data visualization is poised for even greater innovation. We can anticipate deeper integration with Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR), allowing for truly immersive data exploration experiences. Imagine walking through a 3D representation of your company's sales data, interacting with predicted trends, or collaborating with colleagues in a virtual data environment. Voice-activated data exploration, allowing users to query and manipulate visualizations using natural language commands, is also on the horizon, making data interaction more intuitive and accessible. These advancements, alongside continuous improvements in data visualization techniques and tools, promise a future where data insights are not just presented, but truly experienced and understood.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Zinswende und Immobilienmärkte: Wie sich steigende Zinsen auswirken</title><link>https://dev.to/smartlandlord/zinswende-und-immobilienmarkte-wie-sich-steigende-zinsen-auswirken-55ni</link><author>Lukas Schneider</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 17:37:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Die Ära des billigen Geldes ist vorbei. Nach über einem Jahrzehnt Nullzinspolitik vollzieht die Europäische Zentralbank eine historische Wende. Zinsen von 4% und mehr sind wieder Realität – mit dramatischen Auswirkungen auf Immobilienmärkte. Was jahrelang funktionierte, funktioniert plötzlich nicht mehr. Investoren müssen ihre Strategien fundamental überdenken.Die Zinswende trifft nicht alle Marktsegmente gleich. Während manche Immobilientypen unter Druck geraten, entstehen für andere neue Chancen. Entscheidend ist das Verständnis der komplexen Wirkungsmechanismen zwischen Zinsen, Bewertungen und Cashflows.
  
  
  Die Mechanik der Zinswende
Steigende Zinsen wirken über mehrere Kanäle auf Immobilienmärkte:Direkter Finanzierungseffekt: Höhere Kreditzinsen reduzieren die Kaufkraft der Investoren. Was bei 1% Zinsen noch rentabel war, wird bei 4% zum Verlustgeschäft.: Zukünftige Mieteinnahmen werden mit höheren Zinsen diskontiert, was die Barwerte reduziert.Opportunitätskosteneffekt: Sichere Anleihen bieten wieder attraktive Renditen. Immobilien müssen höhere Risikoprämien bieten.: Weniger verfügbares Kapital reduziert Nachfrage und erhöht Finanzierungskosten.
  
  
  Bewertungsauswirkungen: Die neue Mathematik
Die Auswirkungen auf Immobilienbewertungen sind erheblich:: Bei Diskontierungssätzen von 6% statt 2% sinken Barwerte um 30-40%.Yield Compression Reversal: Der Jahrzehnte-Trend sinkender Renditen kehrt sich um. Cap Rates steigen von 3% auf 5%+.: Preis-Miete-Multiples sinken von 25-30x auf 15-20x.: Unterschiede zwischen A- und B-Lagen werden größer.
  
  
  Segmentanalyse: Gewinner und Verlierer
: Relative Resilenz durch demografische Trends und Wohnungsmangel. Preiskorrekturen von 10-20% in überteuerten Märkten.: Doppelbelastung durch Remote Work und höhere Zinsen. Korrekturen von 20-40% bei Standard-Objekten.: Struktureller Wandel durch E-Commerce verstärkt sich. Nur Premium-Lagen bleiben stabil.: Profitieren von E-Commerce-Boom, aber hohe Bewertungen korrigieren sich.: Erholen sich von Corona, aber höhere Finanzierungskosten belasten.
  
  
  Regionale Auswirkungen: Deutschland im Detail
A-Städte (München, Frankfurt, Hamburg):Premium-Lagen bleiben resilientStandard-Objekte unter DruckInternationale Investoren reduzieren AllokationB-Städte (Dresden, Nürnberg, Karlsruhe):Attraktivere Renditen bei moderaten PreisenWeniger spekulative ÜbertreibungPotenzial für antizyklische InvestmentsC-Städte und ländliche Gebiete:Demografische Herausforderungen verstärken sichNur sehr selektive Investments sinnvoll
  
  
  Finanzierungslandschaft im Wandel
: Kreditvergabe wird selektiver. Höhere Eigenkapitalanforderungen und strengere Bonitätsprüfung.: Aufschlag zum Basiszins steigt von 1% auf 2%+. Risikodifferenzierung wird schärfer.: Banken finanzieren weniger vom Kaufpreis. 60-70% LTV wird Standard.: Private Debt und Mezzanine-Kapital wachsen. Höhere Kosten, aber mehr Flexibilität.
  
  
  Cashflow-Auswirkungen: Die neue Realität
Break-even-Mieten steigen: Bei 4% Zinsen statt 1% müssen Mieten 50-100% höher sein für positiven Cashflow.: Höhere Zinsen reduzieren mögliche Tilgung bei gleicher Rate.Working Capital Belastung: Höhere Finanzierungskosten belasten operative Liquidität.: Investments mit variablen Zinsen kommen unter Verkaufsdruck.
  
  
  Marktzyklen: Timing wird entscheidend
: Preiskorrekturen und Marktbereinigung. Schwache Investoren müssen verkaufen.: Bodenbildung und selektive Opportunitäten. Antizyklische Käufe möglich.: Neue Marktgleichgewichte etablieren sich. Normalisierung auf höherem Zinsniveau.: Neuer Aufwärtszyklus beginnt, aber auf anderem Bewertungsniveau.
  
  
  Investmentstrategien für die Zinswende
:Fokus auf Core-Assets mit stabilen CashflowsLange Zinsbindungen für Bestands-FinanzierungenModerate Verschuldung unter 60% LTVDiversifikation über verschiedene Segmente:Distressed Assets von überschuldeten VerkäufernValue-Add bei korrigierten PreisenSale-Leaseback-OpportunitätenIncome-fokussierte Strategien:Höhere laufende Renditen werden wieder attraktivDividenden-Yields von REITs steigenHigh-Yield-Investments in Secondary Markets
  
  
  Zinssicherung: Hedging-Strategien
: Zinssicherung für zukünftige Finanzierungen.: Obergrenze für variable Zinsen.: Kombination aus Caps und Floors.: Flexibilität bei Zinsabsicherung.
  
  
  Neubewertung von Altbeständen
Mark-to-Market-Anpassungen: Portfolios müssen neu bewertet werden.: Objektwerte auf Nachhaltigkeit prüfen.: Anschlussfinanzierungen werden teurer.: Exit-Optionen bei ungünstigen Refinanzierungen.

Tools wie SmartLandlord.de helfen bei der Analyse von Zinsänderungs-Auswirkungen auf Portfolios.
  
  
  Internationale Perspektive
: Federal Reserve ebenfalls auf Zinserhöhungs-Kurs. Ähnliche Marktdynamiken.: Brexit plus Zinswende belasten Immobilienmärkte stark.: Kapitalabflüsse und Währungsabwertungen verstärken Druck.: Unterschiedliche Zinspolitiken schaffen Arbitrage-Möglichkeiten.
  
  
  REITs vs. Direktinvestments
: Höhere Zinsen belasten Bewertungen überproportional.: Mehr Kontrolle über Timing und Finanzierung.: Kombination aus beiden für optimale Diversifikation.: Höhere Zinsen bedeuten höhere steuerliche Abzüge.: Steuervorteile gegen Finanzierungsrisiken abwägen.: Verkäufe und Käufe steuerlich optimieren.: Höhere Liquiditätspuffer für opportunistische Käufe.: Ungenutzte Kreditlinien als Flexibilitätspuffer.: Verkauf schwacher Assets zur Kriegskasse-Aufbau.
  
  
  Risikomanagement in volatilen Zeiten
: Portfolios auf verschiedene Zinsszenarien testen.: Risiken über Assets, Regionen und Strategien streuen.: Kreditverträge auf Einhaltung prüfen.: Frühzeitige Erkennung problematischer Entwicklungen.
  
  
  Langfristige Strukturveränderungen
: Zinsen zwischen 3-5% als langfristiger Durchschnitt.: Immobilienpreise finden neue, niedrigere Gleichgewichte.Geschäftsmodell-Evolution: Fokus auf operative Exzellenz statt reiner Bewertungssteigerung.: Selektivität und Qualität werden wichtiger als Quantität.
  
  
  Fazit: Chance in der Krise
Die Zinswende ist schmerzhafte Anpassung, aber auch reinigende Kraft. Spekulativer Überschwang wird bereinigt, nachhaltige Geschäftsmodelle setzen sich durch.Für gut positionierte Investoren entstehen die besten Opportunitäten seit der Finanzkrise 2008. Wer Liquidität hat, defensive Finanzierung und antizyklisch denkt, kann von der Zinswende profitieren.Die neue Ära erfordert andere Strategien, aber sie bietet auch neue Chancen. Die Zukunft gehört jenen, die sich an veränderte Marktbedingungen anpassen und Qualität über Quantität stellen.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Generationenwechsel am Immobilienmarkt: Millennials vs. Gen Z</title><link>https://dev.to/smartlandlord/generationenwechsel-am-immobilienmarkt-millennials-vs-gen-z-36mk</link><author>Lukas Schneider</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 17:35:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Der deutsche Immobilienmarkt erlebt einen fundamentalen Generationenwechsel.

Was als Nischensegment für umweltbewusste Investoren begann, entwickelt sich zum neuen Standard. Nachhaltige Immobilien erzielen nicht nur höhere Mieten und Verkaufspreise, sie werden zunehmend zur Grundvoraussetzung für Vermietbarkeit und Finanzierbarkeit.Der Druck kommt von allen Seiten: Regulierung verschärft Energiestandards, Mieter fordern nachhaltige Gebäude, Banken verknüpfen Finanzierungskonditionen mit ESG-Kriterien. Investoren, die diesen Trend ignorieren, riskieren stranded assets – Immobilien, die trotz grundsätzlich guter Lage unverkäuflich werden.
  
  
  Der regulatorische Rahmen: EU Green Deal treibt Transformation
Die Europäische Union hat mit dem Green Deal den Rahmen gesetzt: Bis 2050 soll Europa klimaneutral werden. Das bedeutet für Immobilien drastische Verschärfungen der Energiestandards.Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD): Ab 2030 müssen alle Neubauten in der EU emissionsfrei sein. Bestehende Gebäude müssen bis 2050 auf Netto-Null-Emissionen saniert werden.: Das Gebäude-Energie-Gesetz (GEG) wird kontinuierlich verschärft. Ab 2024 müssen neue Heizungen mindestens 65% erneuerbare Energien nutzen.: Definiert, welche Immobilien als "nachhaltig" gelten. Wichtig für Finanzierung und institutionelle Investoren.Carbon Border Adjustments: Importierte Baumaterialien mit hohem CO2-Footprint werden teurer. Das verändert Baukostenkalkulation.

Wo früher täglich Tausende von Angestellten ein- und ausgingen, herrscht heute gedämpfte Betriebsamkeit. Remote Work hat nicht nur das Arbeiten verändert – es stellt die gesamte Gewerbeimmobilienbranche vor existenzielle Fragen.Für Investoren ist die Situation paradox: Während Büroimmobilien unter Druck stehen, entstehen neue Opportunitäten in Lagerhallen, Datencentern und flexiblen Arbeitsräumen. Die Gewinner und Verlierer der neuen Arbeitswelt zu identifizieren, wird zur Überlebensfrage für Gewerbeimmobilien-Investoren.
  
  
  Die Datenlage: Wie dramatisch ist der Wandel wirklich?
Die Zahlen sind eindeutig: Deutsche Unternehmen haben ihre Büroflächen-Nachfrage um durchschnittlich 25% reduziert. In Frankfurt, dem deutschen Büro-Hotspot, sank die Neuvermietung 2023 um 35%. Gleichzeitig steigen Leerstände und Untervermietungen.Flächenreduktion nach Branchen:IT/Software: -40% (Vorreiter bei Remote Work)Beratung: -30% (Projekt-basierte Arbeit)Finanzdienstleistungen: -20% (Compliance erfordert Präsenz)Industrieunternehmen: -15% (Verwaltung reduziert, Produktion bleibt)München: -20% (Premium-Standort bleibt resilient)Frankfurt: -35% (Banking-Wandel trifft hart)Berlin: -25% (Start-up-Kultur ermöglicht Flexibilität)Hamburg: -30% (Medien- und Handelsunternehmen sparen Fläche)
  
  
  Die Verlierer: Welche Büroimmobilien leiden?
Standard-Bürogebäude in B-Lagen: Gebäude ohne besondere Ausstattung oder Lage verlieren massiv an Nachfrage. Mieten sinken um 15-25%, Leerstände steigen auf 15-20%.: Open-Space-Layouts sind in Zeiten von Social Distancing und Konzentrationsbedürfnis unattraktiv geworden.Monofunktionale Büroparks: Reine Büro-Standorte ohne Mixed-Use-Charakter verlieren an Attraktivität. Mitarbeiter schätzen urbane Umgebungen mit Gastronomie und Services.: Gebäude ohne moderne IT-Infrastruktur, Klimatechnik oder Sicherheitssysteme werden abgehängt.
  
  
  Die Gewinner: Neue Büro-Konzepte entstehen
Premium-Kollaborationsräume: High-End-Büros mit Fokus auf Teamwork und Kreativität boomen. Unternehmen zahlen mehr für weniger Fläche, aber höhere Qualität.: Co-Working-Spaces und Serviced Offices verzeichnen Rekordzuwächse. WeWork mag gescheitert sein, aber das Konzept funktioniert.: Büros, die zwischen verschiedenen Nutzungsformen wechseln können. Morgens Einzelarbeit, nachmittags Teamwork, abends Events.: Dezentrale Arbeitsplätze in Wohnvierteln ermöglichen wohnortnahe Arbeit ohne vollständiges Homeoffice.Die Umwidmung von Büros ist nicht mehr Ausnahme, sondern Regel:: Leerstehende Bürogebäude werden zu Wohnungen umgebaut. Besonders in Innenstädten mit Wohnungsmangel attraktiv.: Kombination aus Wohnen, Arbeiten, Einzelhandel und Gastronomie. Entstehung neuer urbaner Quartiere.: Urbane Logistik-Hubs in ehemaligen Bürogebäuden für Last-Mile-Delivery.: Umwandlung in Schulen, Universitäten oder Weiterbildungszentren.
  
  
  Neue Gewerbeimmobilien-Kategorien boomen
: Digitalisierung und Cloud Computing treiben Nachfrage. Deutschland baut massiv Data-Center-Kapazitäten auf.: E-Commerce-Boom erfordert mehr Lager- und Verteilzentren. Letzte-Meile-Logistik wird urban.: Pharma, Biotech und Medizintechnik wachsen überproportional. Spezialisierte Laborgebäude sind gefragt.: KI und Machine Learning erfordern massive Rechenkapazitäten. Energie-effiziente Rechenzentren werden strategisch wichtig.
  
  
  Technologie verändert Büro-Anforderungen
Smart Building wird Standard: Intelligente Gebäudetechnik optimiert Energieverbrauch, Sicherheit und Nutzererfahrung.: Nach Corona sind Belüftung und Luftreinigung wichtiger denn je. HEPA-Filter und UV-Sterilisation werden Standard.: Aufzüge, Türen und Klimaanlagen werden über Apps gesteuert. Hygiene und Komfort verbinden sich.: Modulare Büro-Systeme ermöglichen schnelle Umgestaltung je nach Bedarf.
  
  
  ESG-Kriterien werden kritisch
: Green Buildings sind nicht nur Image-Faktor, sondern Vermietungsvoraussetzung. DGNB- oder BREEAM-Zertifizierung wird Pflicht.: Fahrrad-Stellplätze, E-Lademöglichkeiten und ÖPNV-Anbindung werden wichtiger als Parkplätze.: Büros müssen Wohlbefinden und Work-Life-Balance fördern. Grünflächen, Fitness-Bereiche und Ruhezonen gehören dazu.: Transparente Bewirtschaftung und Mieterservice werden Differenzierungsmerkmale.
  
  
  Bewertungsherausforderungen für Gewerbeimmobilien
Traditionelle Methoden versagen: DCF-Modelle mit historischen Mietentwicklungen sind unbrauchbar geworden.Szenario-basierte Bewertung: Multiple Szenarien für verschiedene Remote-Work-Durchdringungen notwendig.Höhere Diskontierungssätze: Unsicherheit führt zu Risikoaufschlägen bei der Bewertung.: Potenzial für alternative Nutzungen wird wichtiger als reine Büro-Bewertung.
  
  
  Finanzierung wird schwieriger
: Kreditvergabe für Standard-Büroimmobilien wird restriktiver. Höhere Eigenkapital-Anforderungen.: Premium-Objekte und neue Konzepte finden noch Finanzierung, aber zu höheren Kosten.: Debt Funds und Private Lender gewinnen Marktanteile in der Gewerbeimmobilien-Finanzierung.
  
  
  Mietvertragsstrukturen ändern sich
: Unternehmen wollen Flexibilität. 10-Jahres-Verträge werden zu 3-5-Jahres-Verträgen.: Mieten passen sich an tatsächliche Nutzung an. Pay-per-Use-Modelle entstehen.: All-Inclusive-Konzepte mit Reinigung, Sicherheit und IT-Services.: Break-Clauses und flexible Exit-Möglichkeiten werden Standard.
  
  
  Investment-Strategien für die neue Büro-Welt
: Traditionelle Core-Büro-Investments funktionieren nicht mehr. Aufwertungspotenzial wird notwendig.Conversion-Spezialist werden: Expertise in Umnutzungen kann überdurchschnittliche Renditen generieren.: Investment in Data Centers, Life Sciences oder urbane Logistik.Management-intensive Strategien: Aktives Asset Management wird wichtiger als Buy-and-Hold.
  
  
  Technologie als Investment-Tool
: Digitale Lösungen für Vermietung, Verwaltung und Optimierung.: Nutzungsdaten für bessere Vermietungs- und Bewirtschaftungsstrategien.: VR-Besichtigungen und -Planungen reduzieren Kosten und Zeit.: Platforms wie SmartLandlord.de können bei der Bewertung neuer Gewerbeimmobilien-Trends und Umnutzungspotenzialen unterstützen.
  
  
  Regionale Strategien entwickeln
: Fokus auf Premium-Lagen und Umnutzung. Nur beste Qualität überlebt.: Opportunitäten in günstiger eingekauften Assets mit Aufwertungspotenzial.: Transformation zu Logistik- und Data-Center-Hubs.
  
  
  Risikomanagement in volatilen Märkten
: Nicht nur auf Büros setzen, sondern Portfolio um andere Nutzungsarten erweitern.: Investments mit Umnutzungspotenzial bevorzugen.: Distressed Cycles für Akquisitionen nutzen.: Joint Ventures für Risikoteilung bei unsicheren Investments.
  
  
  Ausblick: Wie geht es weiter?
: Vollständige Rückkehr ins Büro ist unwahrscheinlich. 3-4 Tage Büro werden normal.: Weniger Bürofläche, aber höhere Ansprüche an Ausstattung und Lage.: Dezentrale Arbeitsplätze in Wohnvierteln ergänzen zentrale Hauptsitze.: Smart Buildings und flexible Infrastrukturen werden Standard.
  
  
  Fazit: Transformation als Chance
Das traditionelle Büro stirbt nicht, aber es transformiert sich fundamental. Für Investoren entstehen dadurch sowohl Risiken als auch Chancen. Wer die neuen Trends versteht und entsprechend positioniert, kann von der größten Transformation der Gewerbeimmobilien-Branche seit Jahrzehnten profitieren.Die Zukunft gehört flexiblen, technologisch fortschrittlichen und nachhaltig gestalteten Arbeitsräumen. Investoren, die diese Evolution antizipieren und mitgestalten, werden die Gewinner der post-Remote-Work-Ära sein.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Stadt vs. Umland: Wie Remote Work die Immobiliennachfrage verschiebt</title><link>https://dev.to/smartlandlord/stadt-vs-umland-wie-remote-work-die-immobiliennachfrage-verschiebt-3ndb</link><author>Lukas Schneider</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 17:26:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Die Corona-Pandemie hat einen Trend beschleunigt, der die Immobilienmärkte fundamental verändert: Die Entkopplung von Arbeitsplatz und Wohnort. Remote Work und Hybrid-Modelle ermöglichen es Millionen von Arbeitnehmern, den Wohnort freier zu wählen. Das verschiebt die Nachfrage von teuren Innenstädten ins günstigere Umland – mit dramatischen Folgen für Immobilieninvestoren.Doch die Geschichte ist komplexer als der simple Exodus aus den Städten. Während manche Viertel an Attraktivität verlieren, profitieren andere. Und auch im Umland entstehen neue Hotspots, die geschickte Investoren längst entdeckt haben.
  
  
  Remote Work: Zahlen und Trends
Die Homeoffice-Revolution ist real und nachhaltig. Studien zeigen: 40% der deutschen Arbeitnehmer arbeiten zumindest teilweise remote. Vor Corona waren es 12%. Diese Verschiebung ist nicht temporär – sie verändert dauerhaft die Art, wie und wo wir leben.: IT, Beratung und Finanzdienstleistungen führen bei Remote Work. Fertigung, Einzelhandel und Gastronomie bleiben standortgebunden. Das schafft unterschiedliche Nachfragemuster in verschiedenen Regionen.: Millennials und Gen Z nutzen Remote Work intensiver als ältere Generationen. Das beeinflusst Nachfrage nach bestimmten Wohnformen und Stadtteilen.: Höher verdienende Fachkräfte haben mehr Flexibilität bei der Wohnortwahl. Das verstärkt Gentrifizierung in attraktiven Umlandgemeinden.
  
  
  Die Verlierer: Innenstädtische Hotspots unter Druck
: Quartiere, die primär von Büroarbeitern belebt wurden, verlieren an Attraktivität. Frankfurt Bankenviertel, Düsseldorf Königsallee-Umfeld oder München Maxvorstadt zeigen rückläufige Wohnungsnachfrage.: Wohnungen mit Premiumpreisen für S-Bahn-Nähe verlieren ihren Aufschlag. Wenn der tägliche Pendelweg entfällt, werden andere Faktoren wichtiger.: Winzige Wohnungen in teuren Lagen verlieren Nachfrage. Wer den ganzen Tag zu Hause arbeitet, braucht mehr Platz.: Straßenlärm war bei 8-Stunden-Abwesenheit erträglich. Bei Homeoffice wird er zum Problem.
  
  
  Die Gewinner: Qualität wird wichtiger als Lage
Familienfreundliche Stadtteile: Quartiere mit Schulen, Parks und Familien-Infrastruktur profitieren. Prenzlauer Berg, München Schwabing oder Hamburg Eimsbüttel bleiben gefragt.: Stadtteile mit Parkanschluss und niedrigerer Bebauungsdichte gewinnen. Berliner Außenbezirke oder Münchner Randlagen profitieren.: Kreative Viertel mit Gastronomie, Kunst und Kultur bleiben attraktiv. Das soziale Leben wird wichtiger, wenn die Arbeit zu Hause stattfindet.Gut erschlossene Neubaugebiete: Moderne Quartiere mit Glasfaser und guter Infrastruktur werden bevorzugt.
  
  
  Das Umland boomt: Neue Hotspots entstehen
: Orte wie Starnberg, Freising oder Erding (München), Kronberg oder Bad Homburg (Frankfurt) erleben Nachfrage-Explosionen.Mittelstädte in Pendeldistanz: Bamberg, Bayreuth (München-nah), Limburg, Gießen (Frankfurt-nah) oder Lüneburg (Hamburg-nah) profitieren von der Stadtflucht.: Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Berchtesgaden oder der Bodensee ziehen Remote Worker an, die Lebensqualität über Arbeitsplatz-Nähe stellen.: Heidelberg, Tübingen oder Göttingen kombinieren kulturelles Angebot mit moderaten Preisen.
  
  
  Infrastruktur wird zum Erfolgsfaktor
: Glasfaser wird wichtiger als U-Bahn-Anschluss. Gemeinden ohne schnelles Internet haben schlechte Chancen.Flexible Verkehrsanbindung: Nicht tägliches Pendeln, aber gelegentliche Fahrten in die Stadt müssen möglich bleiben. ICE-Anschluss wird wichtiger als S-Bahn.Lebensqualität-Infrastruktur: Restaurants, Cafés, Fitness-Studios und kulturelle Angebote gewinnen an Bedeutung. Das Umland muss mehr bieten als nur günstigen Wohnraum.: Für Familien werden Schulen und Kindergärten noch wichtiger, da die Wohnort-Wahl flexibler wird.
  
  
  Neue Wohnbedürfnisse: Mehr Platz, mehr Funktionen
: Separate Arbeitsräume oder abtrennbare Bereiche werden unverzichtbar. Altbauten mit Zimmer-Grundrissen profitieren.: Balkone, Terrassen oder Gärten gewinnen massiv an Wert. Erdgeschoss-Wohnungen mit Garten sind besonders gefragt.: Statt 2-Zimmer-Apartment wird 3-Zimmer-Wohnung nachgefragt. Familien brauchen noch mehr Platz.: Schallisolierung und ruhige Lagen werden wichtiger. Straßenseitige Wohnungen verlieren Attraktivität.
  
  
  Auswirkungen auf Gewerbeimmobilien
Büroflächennachfrage sinkt: Unternehmen reduzieren Büroflächen um 20-40%. Besonders betroffen: Standardbüros in B-Lagen.Flexible Arbeitsplätze boomen: Co-Working-Spaces und Business Center profitieren. Auch im Umland entstehen neue Konzepte.: Leerstehende Büros werden zu Wohnungen, Hotels oder Mixed-Use-Projekten umgewandelt.: Online-Handel boomt durch Homeoffice. Logistik-Immobilien sind Gewinner der Entwicklung.
  
  
  Regional-spezifische Entwicklungen
: Extreme Preise treiben Exodus ins Umland. Rosenheim, Augsburg und Ingolstadt profitieren überproportional.: Banker bleiben stadt-nah, aber IT-ler ziehen ins Umland. Unterschiedliche Branchen-Dynamiken.: Kreative ziehen in Außenbezirke oder Brandenburg. Tech-Arbeiter bleiben eher in der Stadt.: Nordsee-Nähe wird Alleinstellungsmerkmal. Schleswig-Holstein profitiert vom Hamburg-Exodus.
  
  
  Investmentstrategien für die neue Normalität
: Gezieltes Investment in wachsende Umlandgemeinden mit guter Infrastruktur.: Fokus auf Wohnqualität statt reine Lage. Größere Wohnungen mit Extras werden bevorzugt.: Projekte, die Wohnen, Arbeiten und Leben kombinieren, haben Zukunft.Conversion-Opportunitäten: Umnutzung von Büros zu Wohnungen kann attraktive Renditen generieren.
  
  
  Due Diligence für Umland-Investments
Digitale Infrastruktur prüfen: Glasfaser-Ausbaustand und -planung sind kritisch.Pendel-Optionen analysieren: Auch bei weniger häufigem Pendeln muss Anbindung vorhanden sein.: Wächst die Gemeinde oder schrumpft sie? Altersstruktur und Wanderungsmuster prüfen.: Umland-Gemeinden können Zuzug durch Baurecht begrenzen.
  
  
  Finanzierungsbesonderheiten
Bewertungsherausforderungen: Umland-Immobilien haben weniger Vergleichswerte. Bewertung wird schwieriger.: Manche Banken finanzieren ungern abgelegene Objekte. Lokale Institute bevorzugen.: Höhere Volatilität als in etablierten Stadtlagen. Booms und Korrekturen sind ausgeprägter.: Für Umland-Objekte besonders wichtig, da Anfahrten länger sind.: Wird im Homeoffice wichtiger. Intelligente Heizung, Licht und Sicherheit haben Mehrwert.: Platforms wie SmartLandlord.de helfen bei der Bewertung von Umland-Opportunitäten und der Einschätzung von Remote-Work-Trends.
  
  
  Langfristige Perspektiven
: Vollständiges Remote Work oder komplette Büro-Rückkehr sind Extreme. Hybrid-Modelle setzen sich durch.: Umland-Hotspots entwickeln eigene Dynamik und werden zu eigenständigen Zentren.: Erfolgreiche Umland-Gemeinden investieren in Infrastruktur und Attraktivität.: Jüngere Generationen sind flexibler bei Wohnort-Entscheidungen.
  
  
  Risiken nicht unterschätzen
: Rückkehr zu strikten Büro-Präsenz-Pflichten könnte Umland-Boom stoppen.Infrastruktur-Überlastung: Erfolgreiche Umland-Gemeinden können an Kapazitätsgrenzen stoßen.: Manche Umland-Märkte könnten überbewertet werden.
  
  
  Fazit: Die neue Geografie des Wohnens
Remote Work verändert die Immobilienmärkte fundamental und nachhaltig. Investoren müssen ihre Strategien anpassen und neue Kriterien für Standortbewertungen entwickeln. Das Umland bietet Chancen, aber auch Risiken.Erfolgreiche Investoren verstehen die neuen Nachfragemuster und positionieren sich entsprechend. Wer früh die richtigen Umland-Hotspots identifiziert, kann von dieser historischen Verschiebung profitieren.Die Zukunft gehört flexiblen Wohn- und Arbeitsmodellen. Immobilieninvestoren, die diese Trends verstehen und nutzen, werden die Gewinner der post-Corona-Ära sein.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>merging Markets: Wo deutsche Investoren als nächstes investieren sollten</title><link>https://dev.to/smartlandlord/merging-markets-wo-deutsche-investoren-als-nachstes-investieren-sollten-3khb</link><author>Lukas Schneider</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 17:24:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Der deutsche Immobilienmarkt stößt in vielen Segmenten an Bewertungsgrenzen. Renditen von 2-3% in München oder Frankfurt motivieren Investoren, über den Tellerrand zu blicken. Doch wo finden sich die attraktiven Emerging Markets von morgen? Und welche deutschen Städte entwickeln sich von B- zu A-Standorten?Die Antwort liegt nicht in exotischen Auslandsmärkten, sondern oft vor der Haustür. Deutschland hat Dutzende von Städten mit Wachstumspotenzial, die von Investoren noch nicht entdeckt wurden. Der Trick liegt darin, diese Märkte zu identifizieren, bevor sie mainstream werden.
  
  
  Die Definition von Emerging Real Estate Markets

Inflation, Zinsschwankungen, geopolitische Spannungen und schwarze Schwäne wie die Corona-Pandemie gehören zum Investorenalltag. Erfolgreiche Immobilieninvestoren bereiten sich auf Krisen vor, statt darauf zu reagieren.Die Ironie liegt darin, dass Krisen oft die besten Investmentmöglichkeiten schaffen. Während die Mehrheit paralysiert wartet, entstehen für vorbereitete Investoren außergewöhnliche Chancen. Der Schlüssel liegt in antizyklischen Strategien und defensiven Portfoliostrukturen.
  
  
  Immobilien als Krisenasset: Mythos oder Realität?
Immobilien gelten als "Betongold" – sicher, werterhaltend und krisenresistent. Diese Annahme ist teilweise richtig, aber auch gefährlich vereinfachend. Immobilien sind nicht automatisch krisensicher, aber sie können es sein, wenn man die richtigen Strategien anwendet.: Immobilien bieten natürlichen Inflationsschutz durch indexierte Mietverträge und Sachwertcharakter. Jedoch nicht alle Immobilien profitieren gleichermaßen. Lage, Mieterstruktur und Finanzierung entscheiden über die Inflationsresistenz.: Immobilien korrelieren historisch wenig mit Aktien und Anleihen. Das macht sie zu wertvollen Portfolio-Diversifikators. Aber in systemischen Krisen können Korrelationen gegen eins gehen.: Mieteinnahmen sind typischerweise stabiler als Dividenden oder Zinsen. Jedoch nur bei qualitativ hochwertigen Mietern und angemessenen Leerstandsreserven.
  
  
  Defensive Portfoliostrukturen entwickeln
Core Holdings priorisieren: 60-70% des Portfolios sollten in Core-Assets investiert sein: Stabile Lagen, qualitätsvolle Mieter, konservative Finanzierung. Diese Objekte überstehen Krisen auch bei temporären Wertrückgängen.Geografische Diversifikation: Regionale Konzentration ist gefährlich. Diversifikation über verschiedene Märkte reduziert lokale Risiken. Mindestens 3-4 verschiedene Städte/Regionen bei größeren Portfolios.Mieterstruktur optimieren: Systemrelevante Mieter, öffentliche Arbeitgeber und defensive Branchen sind krisenresistenter. Vermeiden Sie Abhängigkeiten von zyklischen Branchen.: Ausreichende Reserven für 12-18 Monate ohne Mieteinnahmen. Krisen dauern oft länger als erwartet.
  
  
  Finanzierungsstrategien für unsichere Zeiten
: LTV unter 60-70% schafft Sicherheitspuffer. Höhere Verschuldung kann in Krisen existenzbedrohend werden.: Zinsänderungsrisiken durch lange Bindungsfristen minimieren. Kostet mehr, aber schafft Planungssicherheit.Diversifizierte Finanzierung: Abhängigkeit von einzelnen Banken vermeiden. Mehrere Kreditgeber und Finanzierungsformen nutzen.: Möglichkeiten für Tilgungsaussetzung oder -reduktion vereinbaren. Schafft Liquiditätspuffer in schwierigen Phasen.
  
  
  Antizyklische Opportunitäten erkennen
Krisen schaffen Investmentchancen für vorbereitete Investoren:: Zwangsverkäufe, Insolvenzen und Notverkäufe bieten Preischancen. Erfordern schnelle Entscheidungen und ausreichende Liquidität.: Wenn Banken zurückhaltend werden, entstehen Chancen in der Projektfinanzierung. Höhere Renditen, aber auch höhere Risiken.: Unternehmen in Liquiditätsnot verkaufen Immobilien und mieten zurück. Langfristige, stabile Mietverträge möglich.: Antizyklischer Kauf in Abschwungphasen. Erfordert Mut und langfristige Perspektive.
  
  
  Sektorrotation: Gewinner und Verlierer in Krisen
Wohnimmobilien in stabilen LagenSupermärkte und DiscounterPflegeimmobilien und HealthcareBüroimmobilien (teilweise)
  
  
  Mietermanagement in Krisenzeiten
: Frühzeitige Gespräche mit Mietern bei ersten Anzeichen von Problemen. Lösungen sind oft möglich, wenn man früh reagiert.: Temporäre Mietreduktionen können besser sein als Leerstand und Neuvermietungskosten.: Mietausfallversicherungen und rechtliche Absicherung bei Zahlungsproblemen.Mieter-Bonität überwachen: Regelmäßige Prüfung der Mieter-Bonität, besonders bei Gewerbe-Mietern.
  
  
  Bewertungsherausforderungen in volatilen Märkten
Traditionelle Bewertungsverfahren versagen oft in Krisen:: Wenige Transaktionen führen zu unzuverlässigen Vergleichswerten.: Unsichere Cashflow-Prognosen reduzieren Modellzuverlässigkeit.: Mehrere Szenarien (Best/Base/Worst Case) für robustere Bewertungen.: Portfolios auf extreme Szenarien testen. Tools wie SmartLandlord.de können bei solchen Analysen unterstützen.
  
  
  Steueroptimierung in Krisenzeiten
: Verluste strategisch realisieren für Steueroptimierung.: Krisenbedingte staatliche Förderungen und Steuervorteile nutzen.: Steuerliche Liquiditätswirkungen in Krisenplanung einbeziehen.
  
  
  Technologie als Krisenverstärker und -löser
: Digitale Tools für Effizienzsteigerung und Kostensenkung.: Remote Management reduziert operative Risiken.: Big Data für bessere Markteinschätzungen und Risikoerkennung.: Reduziert Personalabhängigkeiten und operative Risiken.
  
  
  Psychologie des Krisenmanagements
: Panikverkäufe vermeiden, langfristige Perspektive behalten.: Krisen als Chancen begreifen, nicht nur als Risiken.: Starke Beziehungen sind in Krisen besonders wertvoll.: Jede Krise lehrt Lektionen für die nächste.
  
  
  Szenario-Planung: Vorbereitung auf verschiedene Krisen
: Steigende Arbeitslosigkeit, sinkende Mieten, höhere Leerstände. Defensive Positionierung, Liquiditätsreserven.: Steigende Zinsen, Baukosten, aber auch Mieten. Inflationsgeschützte Mietverträge, moderate Verschuldung.: Sinkende Preise und Mieten, Deflationsspirale. Hohe Liquidität, antizyklische Käufe.: Banken- oder Währungskrise. Diversifikation, alternative Finanzierung, internationale Streuung.
  
  
  Internationale Diversifikation als Krisenschutz
: Verschiedene Währungen reduzieren Wechselkursrisiken.: Verschiedene Rechtssysteme reduzieren politische Risiken.: Unterschiedliche Konjunkturzyklen schaffen Stabilität.
  
  
  Exit-Strategien in Krisenzeiten
: Gestaffelte Liquiditätsmöglichkeiten für verschiedene Krisenszenarien.: Verlässliche Käufer oder Joint-Venture-Partner für Notfälle.: Beleihbare Assets für Liquiditätsbeschaffung.
  
  
  Fazit: Krisen als Investmentchance
Wirtschaftliche Unsicherheit ist unvermeidlich, aber Vorbereitung macht den Unterschied. Erfolgreiche Krisennavigation erfordert defensive Grundstrukturen, ausreichende Liquidität und den Mut zu antizyklischen Entscheidungen.Die besten Immobilienportfolios entstehen in Krisen, nicht in Boom-Phasen. Wer vorbereitet ist, kann von Marktineffizienzen und Zwangsverkäufen profitieren. Der Schlüssel liegt in der Balance zwischen Vorsicht und Opportunismus.Immobilien bleiben auch in unsicheren Zeiten eine sinnvolle Anlageklasse – aber nur mit der richtigen Strategie, Struktur und Vorbereitung.

Während Buy-and-Hold-Investoren auf Marktentwicklung und Zeit setzen, schaffen Value-Add-Investoren aktiv Werte durch gezielte Verbesserungen. Das Prinzip ist simpel: Kaufe unter Wert, investiere intelligent, verkaufe mit Gewinn. Die Umsetzung ist deutlich komplexer.Erfolgreiche Value-Add-Strategien erfordern drei Kernkompetenzen: Den richtigen Kaufpreis verhandeln, das Wertschöpfungspotenzial korrekt einschätzen und die Umsetzung professionell managen. Wer eine dieser Komponenten unterschätzt, verwandelt Value-Add schnell in Value-Destroy.
  
  
  Die Anatomie einer Value-Add-Immobilie
Nicht jede Immobilie eignet sich für Value-Add-Strategien. Die besten Opportunitäten haben charakteristische Eigenschaften:: Erben ohne Immobilienexpertise, Unternehmen mit Fokusverschiebung oder Zwangsverkäufe bieten oft Preischancen. Diese Verkäufer sind weniger preisoptimiert und mehr an schnellen, unkomplizierten Abschlüssen interessiert.: Immobilien mit aufgeschobener Instandhaltung, veralteter Ausstattung oder ineffizienter Nutzung bieten Verbesserungspotenzial. Wichtig: Die Bausubstanz muss grundsätzlich gut sein.: Untypische Größen, komplizierte Grundrisse oder regulatorische Beschränkungen schrecken Standard-Investoren ab und schaffen Opportunitäten für Spezialisten.
  
  
  Die vier Säulen der Wertschöpfung
: Verbesserung der Bewirtschaftung kann Erträge steigern ohne Capex. Optimiertes Mieter-Management, Nebenkosten-Kontrolle und Leerstandsreduktion schaffen oft 10-20% Mehrwert.: Renovierung, Modernisierung und Umbauten verbessern Vermietbarkeit und erzielbare Mieten. Der Return on Investment variiert stark je nach Maßnahme und Markt.: Grundrissänderungen, Aufteilung oder Zusammenlegung von Einheiten kann Flächeneffizienz und Mietmultiplikatoren verbessern.: Komplette Neuausrichtung der Immobilie auf andere Zielgruppen oder Nutzungsarten. Höchste Renditen, aber auch höchste Risiken.
  
  
  Renovation-Strategien: Was bringt was?
Cosmetic Upgrades (ROI: 15-25%):Neue Bodenbeläge, Wandfarben, BeleuchtungKüchenmodernisierung (ohne Grundrissänderung)Badaufwertung mit modernen ArmaturenGeringe Investitionen, schnelle UmsetzungSystematic Improvements (ROI: 10-20%):Fenster- und TürenaustauschElektro- und SanitärgrundinstallationMittlere Investitionen, nachhaltige VerbesserungStructural Changes (ROI: 5-15%):Aufstockungen oder AnbautenUmwidmungen (Gewerbe zu Wohnen)Hohe Investitionen, lange Umsetzungszeit
  
  
  Marktanalyse: Wo funktioniert Value-Add?
Value-Add-Strategien funktionieren nicht überall gleich gut:: Hohe Grundpreise reduzieren relative Aufwertungspotenziale. Fokus auf Luxus-Segmente oder außergewöhnliche Lagen. Regulierung oft streng.: Sweet Spot für Value-Add. Ausreichende Nachfrage für aufgewertete Objekte, moderate Grundpreise, weniger Wettbewerb unter Investoren.: Vorsicht bei größeren Investitionen. Nachfrage für Premium-Objekte begrenzt. Fokus auf kostengünstige Verbesserungen.
  
  
  Finanzierung von Value-Add-Projekten
Value-Add-Projekte haben besondere Finanzierungsanforderungen:: Kurzfristige Finanzierung für Kauf und Renovation. Höhere Zinsen, aber Flexibilität für schnelle Umsetzung.Construction-to-Permanent: Kombiniert Bau- und Dauerfinanzierung. Niedrigere Gesamtkosten, aber längere Bindung.: Eigenkapital-ähnliche Finanzierung für Projekte mit hohem Risiko. Teuer, aber flexibel.: Schnelle Entscheidungen, höhere Kosten. Für zeitkritische Opportunitäten geeignet.
  
  
  Projektmanagement: Der Erfolgsfaktor
Professionelles Projektmanagement entscheidet über Erfolg oder Misserfolg:: Umfassende Kostenschätzung, Zeitplanung und Risikobewertung vor Projektstart. Puffer für Unvorhergesehenes einplanen.: Verlässliche Teams mit nachgewiesener Qualität. Festpreisverträge mit Terminbindung. Regelmäßige Kontrollen.: Bauämter, Denkmalschutz und andere Behörden früh einbeziehen. Verfahrensdauer oft unterschätzt.: Regelmäßige Bauabschnittsprüfungen. Mängeldokumentation und Nachbesserungen konsequent verfolgen.
  
  
  Regulatorische Fallstricke
Value-Add-Projekte sind regulatorisch komplex:: Auflagen können Kosten vervielfachen. Vor Kauf Machbarkeit klären.: Moderne Effizienzanforderungen beeinflussen Renovierungsumfang und -kosten.: Modernisierungsumlagen sind begrenzt. Kappungsgrenze und Mietpreisbremse beachten.: Nutzungsänderungen erfordern oft Genehmigungen. Nachbarschaftseinsprüche möglich.
  
  
  Timing: Wann kaufen, wann verkaufen?
: Antizyklisch kaufen in schwachen Märkten. Motivation der Verkäufer ausnutzen.: Wintermonate für Innenarbeiten, Sommerzeit für Außenarbeiten. Handwerkerkapazitäten berücksichtigen.: Nach Fertigstellung stabilisieren lassen. Erste Mietperiode für Wertnachweis nutzen.
  
  
  Risikomanagement bei Value-Add
: Unvorhergesehene Bauschäden, Materialpreissteigerungen, Zeitverzögerungen. Mindesttens 20% Kostenpuffer einplanen.: Nachfrageänderungen während Projektlaufzeit. Marktforschung und kontinuierliches Monitoring wichtig.: Verschärfte Auflagen, Genehmigungsversagung, Nachbarschaftseinsprüche.: Projekte dauern oft länger als geplant. Ausreichende Reserven vorhalten.Moderne Technologie unterstützt Value-Add-Projekte:: Visualisierung geplanter Änderungen für bessere Entscheidungen.Projektmanagement-Software: Terminplanung, Kostenverfolgung, Kommunikation.: Platforms wie SmartLandlord.de helfen bei der Bewertung von Aufwertungspotenzialen und Exit-Szenarien.: Moderne Gebäudetechnik als Differenzierungsmerkmal.
  
  
  Exit-Strategien optimieren
: Optimaler Zeitpunkt nach Stabilisierung. Professionelle Vermarktung maximiert Erlöse.: Ausschüttung des investierten Kapitals bei Werterhöhung. Objekt bleibt im Portfolio.: Wenn Cashflow attraktiv ist und weitere Aufwertung möglich erscheint.
  
  
  Skalierung von Value-Add-Operationen
: Verlässliche Partner für alle Gewerke aufbauen.: Standardprozesse für Due Diligence, Projektmanagement und Exit entwickeln.: Fokus auf bestimmte Objekttypen oder Märkte für Expertiseaufbau.: Joint Ventures für größere Projekte und Risikoteilung.
  
  
  Fazit: Value-Add als nachhaltige Strategie
Value-Add-Strategien können überdurchschnittliche Renditen generieren, erfordern aber erhebliche Expertise und Kapital. Erfolgreiche Value-Add-Investoren denken wie Unternehmer: Sie sehen Potenziale, kalkulieren Risiken und setzen systematisch um.Der deutsche Markt bietet weiterhin Value-Add-Opportunitäten, besonders in B-Städten und bei Spezialobiekten. Wer die erforderlichen Kompetenzen hat oder entwickelt, kann auch in effizienten Märkten Mehrwerte schaffen.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Immobilieninvestment für Einsteiger: Ihr erstes Portfolio aufbauen</title><link>https://dev.to/smartlandlord/immobilieninvestment-fur-einsteiger-ihr-erstes-portfolio-aufbauen-57jf</link><author>Lukas Schneider</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 17:19:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Der erste Schritt in die Immobilieninvestition fühlt sich oft überwältigend an. Kaufpreise von mehreren hunderttausend Euro, komplexe Finanzierungen und unübersichtliche Märkte schrecken viele potenzielle Investoren ab. Dabei ist der Einstieg systematischer möglich, als viele denken – wenn man die richtigen Schritte in der richtigen Reihenfolge geht.Erfolgreiche Immobilieninvestoren sind nicht über Nacht entstanden. Sie haben klein angefangen, systematisch gelernt und ihr Portfolio schrittweise aufgebaut. Der Schlüssel liegt nicht im perfekten ersten Investment, sondern im Start mit einem soliden, durchdachten Ansatz.
  
  
  Grundlagen: Was Sie vor dem ersten Kauf wissen müssen
Bevor Sie auch nur eine einzige Immobilie anschauen, müssen die Grundlagen stimmen. Immobilieninvestment ist ein langfristiges Spiel, das Vorbereitung und finanzielle Disziplin erfordert.Finanzielle Standortbestimmung: Analysieren Sie ehrlich Ihre finanzielle Situation. Wie viel Eigenkapital steht zur Verfügung? Wie hoch ist Ihr stabiles Einkommen? Welche Verbindlichkeiten haben Sie bereits? Ein solides Fundament ist wichtiger als das schnelle erste Investment.Investitionsziele definieren: Warum wollen Sie in Immobilien investieren? Cashflow-Generierung, langfristiger Vermögensaufbau oder Altersvorsorge? Ihre Ziele bestimmen die richtige Strategie und Objektauswahl.: Immobilieninvestment ist komplex. Bücher, Seminare, Podcasts und Online-Kurse zahlen sich vielfach aus. Investieren Sie mindestens 3-6 Monate in Weiterbildung, bevor Sie kaufen.
  
  
  Die 5-Schritte-Strategie für Einsteiger

Konzentrieren Sie sich initial auf einen Markt, den Sie gut kennen. Das kann Ihr Heimatort oder eine Region sein, in der Sie sich regelmäßig aufhalten. Lokale Marktkenntnis ist durch nichts zu ersetzen.Analysieren Sie demografische Trends, Wirtschaftsentwicklung und Infrastrukturprojekte. Wachsende Märkte mit diversifizierter Wirtschaftsstruktur sind für Einsteiger sicherer als spekulative Boom-Regionen.Schritt 2: Objekttyp festlegen
Einsteiger sollten sich auf einen Objekttyp fokussieren. 2-3 Zimmer Wohnungen in mittleren Lagen sind oft ideal: Breite Nachfrage, überschaubare Instandhaltung und moderate Preise.Vermeiden Sie initial Sonderobjekte wie Denkmalimmobilien, Gewerbe oder Ferienimmobilien. Diese erfordern Spezialwissen, das Sie erst mit Erfahrung entwickeln.Schritt 3: Finanzierungsstrategie entwickeln
Klären Sie Ihre Finanzierungsmöglichkeiten, bevor Sie suchen. Sprechen Sie mit mehreren Banken und lassen Sie sich Finanzierungszusagen geben. Das macht Sie zu einem ernsten Käufer und beschleunigt Kaufprozesse.Planen Sie konservativ: 20-30% Eigenkapital plus Kaufnebenkosten sind Standard. Höhere Eigenkapitalquoten reduzieren Risiken und verbessern Konditionen.Schritt 4: Systematische Objektsuche
Entwickeln Sie klare Suchkriterien: Lage, Preisspanne, Baujahr, Größe. Nutzen Sie alle verfügbaren Kanäle: Online-Portale, Zeitungsanzeigen, lokale Makler und Ihr Netzwerk.Schauen Sie sich mindestens 20-30 Objekte an, bevor Sie kaufen. Das schärft den Blick für Preise und Qualitäten. Dokumentieren Sie Besichtigungen systematisch.Schritt 5: Due Diligence und Kauf
Lassen Sie potenzielle Käufe professionell prüfen. Baugutachten, Energieausweis und Mietverträge sind Pflicht. Rechtsanwalt und Notar sollten erfahren im Immobilienrecht sein.Kalkulieren Sie konservativ: Berücksichtigen Sie Leerstand, Instandhaltung und Verwaltungskosten. Tools wie SmartLandlord.de helfen bei professionellen Kalkulationen und Bewertungen.
  
  
  Finanzierung: Der Hebel zum Erfolg
Fremdfinanzierung ist das wichtigste Werkzeug für Immobilieninvestoren. Richtig eingesetzt, verstärkt sie Renditen erheblich. Falsch genutzt, führt sie in die Verschuldung.Eigenkapitalquote optimieren: Mehr Eigenkapital bedeutet niedrigere Zinsen und Risiken, aber auch niedrigere Eigenkapitalrenditen. Finden Sie die richtige Balance für Ihre Situation.: In Zeiten steigender Zinsen sind lange Zinsbindungen oft sinnvoll. Sie kosten mehr, bieten aber Planungssicherheit.: Höhere Tilgungen bauen schnell Eigenkapital auf, reduzieren aber den Cashflow. Niedrigere Tilgungen verbessern Liquidität, verlängern aber die Finanzierung.
  
  
  Risikomanagement: Was schiefgehen kann
Immobilieninvestment ist nicht risikofrei. Einsteiger müssen typische Fallen kennen und vermeiden:: Der größte Fehler ist zu schnelles Wachstum. Sammeln Sie erst Erfahrungen mit einem Objekt, bevor Sie expandieren.Emotionale Entscheidungen: Verlieben Sie sich nicht in Objekte. Bleiben Sie bei Ihren Kriterien und gehen Sie weg, wenn die Zahlen nicht stimmen.: Planen Sie Reserven für unvorhergesehene Ausgaben. 6-12 Monatsmieten als Rücklage sind empfehlenswert.: Diversifizieren Sie geografisch, sobald Sie mehrere Objekte haben. Konzentration auf einen Ort kann gefährlich werden.
  
  
  Steueroptimierung von Anfang an
Steuerliche Aspekte sollten von der ersten Immobilie an mitgedacht werden:: Maximieren Sie den abschreibbaren Gebäudeanteil. Ein Gutachten kann sich lohnen.: Prüfen Sie Möglichkeiten für erhöhte Abschreibungen bei Neubauten oder Sanierungen.: Dokumentieren Sie alle Ausgaben lückenlos. Auch kleine Beträge summieren sich über Jahre.
  
  
  Verwaltung: Selbst machen oder abgeben?
Die Entscheidung zwischen Selbstverwaltung und Hausverwaltung hängt von mehreren Faktoren ab:Selbstverwaltung eignet sich bei:Wenigen Objekten in räumlicher NäheAusreichend Zeit für MieterbetreuungWunsch nach maximaler KontrolleProfessionelle Verwaltung bei:Mehreren Objekten oder großer EntfernungZeitmangel oder fehlendem Know-howKomplexen Objekten oder schwierigen MieternWunsch nach passivem Investment
  
  
  Portfolioaufbau: Von der ersten zur zehnten Immobilie
: Lernen und Erfahrung sammeln. Konzentration auf einen Markt und Objekttyp. Konservative Finanzierung und ausführliche Prüfung.: Erste Diversifikation. Eventuell andere Stadtteile oder Objektgrößen. Optimierung der Verwaltungsstrukturen.: Professionalisierung. Möglicherweise andere Märkte oder Objekttypen. Systematische Portfolio-Optimierung und Steuerplanung.
  
  
  Häufige Anfängerfehler vermeiden
: 100%-Finanzierungen sind verlockend, aber riskant. Planen Sie ausreichende Eigenkapitalquoten.: B- und C-Lagen können attraktive Renditen bieten, erfordern aber mehr Expertise. Einsteiger sollten zunächst auf A- und B+-Lagen setzen.: Optimistische Mietprognosen führen zu Fehlkalkulationen. Seien Sie realistisch bei Mietansätzen und Leerstandszeiten.: Instandhaltung, Verwaltung und Nebenkosten werden oft zu niedrig angesetzt. Kalkulieren Sie großzügig.Digitale Hilfsmittel vereinfachen den Einstieg erheblich:: Nutzen Sie Suchagenten für automatische Benachrichtigungen bei passenden Objekten.: Professionelle Rechner sparen Zeit und vermeiden Fehler.: Digitale Lösungen für Mieterbetreuung und Buchhaltung.Weiterbildungsplattformen: Online-Kurse und Webinare für kontinuierliches Lernen.Erfolgreiche Immobilieninvestoren haben starke Netzwerke:: Gute Makler informieren über Off-Market-Deals.: Verlässliche Handwerker sind Gold wert.: Erfahrungsaustausch und gemeinsame Projekte.Professionelle Dienstleister: Anwälte, Steuerberater, Gutachter.
  
  
  Fazit: Der erfolgreiche Start in die Immobilieninvestition
Immobilieninvestment für Einsteiger ist kein Hexenwerk, aber es erfordert Systematik und Geduld. Wer die Grundlagen beherrscht, konservativ plant und systematisch vorgeht, kann langfristig erfolgreiche Portfolios aufbauen.Der wichtigste Rat: Fangen Sie an, aber fangen Sie richtig an. Bildung, Planung und Disziplin sind wichtiger als das perfekte erste Objekt. Die besten Investoren sind die, die über Jahre kontinuierlich lernen und sich verbessern.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Guide to Install Kimi-Dev 72B: The Most Powerful Open-Source Coding LLM</title><link>https://dev.to/nodeshiftcloud/guide-to-install-kimi-dev-72b-the-most-powerful-open-source-coding-llm-m0g</link><author>Aditi Bindal</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 17:18:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you're working on software engineering tasks and tired of code generation models that break at the first test, meet Kimi-Dev-72B, a coding LLM that actually understands how real-world development works. This open-source model has just set a new benchmark on SWE-bench Verified, scoring 60.4% and outperforming all its open-source peers. Kimi-Dev is trained using large-scale reinforcement learning inside Docker containers, where it only gets rewarded if the entire test suite passes. That means fewer hallucinations, more robust patches, and code you can actually trust in production. If you’re building tools, fixing bugs, or automating dev workflows, Kimi-Dev brings serious engineering muscle to the table, and it’s free to use and extend.In this guide, we’ll walk you through how to install and run Kimi-Dev locally or on the cloud in just a few steps.The minimum system requirements for running this model are:
  
  
  Step-by-step process to install and run Kimi-Dev 72B
For the purpose of this tutorial, we’ll use a GPU-powered Virtual Machine by NodeShift since it provides high compute Virtual Machines at a very affordable cost on a scale that meets GDPR, SOC2, and ISO27001 requirements. Also, it offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easier for beginners to get started with Cloud deployments. However, feel free to use any cloud provider of your choice and follow the same steps for the rest of the tutorial.
  
  
  Step 1: Setting up a NodeShift Account
Visit app.nodeshift.com and create an account by filling in basic details, or continue signing up with your Google/GitHub account.If you already have an account, login straight to your dashboard.
  
  
  Step 2: Create a GPU Node
After accessing your account, you should see a dashboard (see image), now:1) Navigate to the menu on the left side.2) Click on the  option.3) Click on  to start creating your very first GPU node.These GPU nodes are GPU-powered virtual machines by NodeShift. These nodes are highly customizable and let you control different environmental configurations for GPUs ranging from H100s to A100s, CPUs, RAM, and storage, according to your needs.
  
  
  Step 3: Selecting configuration for GPU (model, region, storage)
1) For this tutorial, we’ll be using 2x A100 SXM4 GPU, however, you can choose any GPU as per the prerequisites.2) Similarly, we’ll opt for 200GB storage by sliding the bar. You can also select the region where you want your GPU to reside from the available ones.
  
  
  Step 4: Choose GPU Configuration and Authentication method
1) After selecting your required configuration options, you’ll see the available GPU nodes in your region and according to (or very close to) your configuration. In our case, we’ll choose a 2x A100 80GB GPU node with 32vCPUs/197GB RAM/200GB SSD.2) Next, you'll need to select an authentication method. Two methods are available: Password and SSH Key. We recommend using SSH keys, as they are a more secure option. To create one, head over to our official documentation.The final step is to choose an image for the VM, which in our case is .That's it! You are now ready to deploy the node. Finalize the configuration summary, and if it looks good, click  to deploy the node.
  
  
  Step 6: Connect to active Compute Node using SSH
1) As soon as you create the node, it will be deployed in a few seconds or a minute. Once deployed, you will see a status  in green, meaning that our Compute node is ready to use!2) Once your GPU shows this status, navigate to the three dots on the right, click on , and copy the SSH details that appear.As you copy the details, follow the below steps to connect to the running GPU VM via SSH:1) Open your terminal, paste the SSH command, and run it.2) In some cases, your terminal may take your consent before connecting. Enter ‘yes’.3) A prompt will request a password. Type the SSH password, and you should be connected.Next, If you want to check the GPU details, run the following command in the terminal:
  
  
  Step 7: Set up the project environment with dependencies
1) Create a virtual environment using Anaconda.conda create -n kimi python=3.11 -y && conda activate kimi
2) Once you're inside the environment, install necessary dependencies to run the model.pip install torch torchvision torchaudio einops timm pillow
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
pip install huggingface_hub
pip install sentencepiece bitsandbytes protobuf decord numpy
3) Install and run jupyter notebook.conda install -c conda-forge --override-channels notebook -y
conda install -c conda-forge --override-channels ipywidgets -y
jupyter notebook --allow-root
4) If you're on a remote machine (e.g., NodeShift GPU), you'll need to do SSH port forwarding in order to access the jupyter notebook session on your local browser.Run the following command in your local terminal after replacing: with the PORT allotted to your remote server (For the NodeShift server - you can find it in the deployed GPU details on the dashboard). with the path to the location where your SSH key is stored. with the IP address of your remote server.ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 -p <YOUR_SERVER_PORT> -i <PATH_TO_SSH_KEY> root@<YOUR_SERVER_IP>
After this copy the URL you received in your remote server:And paste this on your local browser to access the Jupyter Notebook session.
  
  
  Step 8: Download and Run the model
1) Open a Python notebook inside Jupyter.2) Download model checkpoints and run the model for inference.from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "moonshotai/Kimi-Dev-72B"

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto"
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

prompt = "Give me a short introduction to large language model."
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
]
text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True
)
model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

generated_ids = model.generate(
    **model_inputs,
    max_new_tokens=512
)
generated_ids = [
    output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
]

response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
print(response)

Diese Frage beschäftigt nicht nur Einsteiger, sondern auch erfahrene Investoren, die ihre Portfolios diversifizieren wollen.Beide Strategien haben ihre Berechtigung, doch die aktuellen Marktbedingungen verändern das Spiel grundlegend. Steigende Baukosten, verschärfte Energiestandards und ein zunehmend kompetitiver Markt erfordern eine durchdachte Herangehensweise. Was früher funktionierte, kann heute zum Verlustgeschäft werden.
  
  
  Buy and Hold: Der Klassiker unter neuen Vorzeichen
Die Buy-and-Hold-Strategie folgt einem simplen Prinzip: Immobilie kaufen, vermieten, langfristig halten. In der Theorie profitiert man von Mieteinnahmen und Wertsteigerung. In der Praxis ist es 2025 komplizierter geworden.Der deutsche Mietmarkt zeigt regionale Extreme. Während in München oder Frankfurt Mietrenditen von 3-4% bereits als gut gelten, bieten B-Städte wie Erfurt oder Chemnitz noch immer Renditen von 6-8%. Diese Spreizung macht eine pauschale Bewertung unmöglich.Entscheidend ist die Finanzierungsstruktur. Bei aktuellen Zinsen um 4% muss die Bruttomietrendite deutlich höher liegen, um einen positiven Cashflow zu generieren. Viele Investoren unterschätzen die laufenden Kosten: Instandhaltung, Verwaltung, Mietausfall und Modernisierungszwang können die Rendite schnell auffressen.Die steuerlichen Aspekte werden oft übersehen. AfA-Abschreibungen und Sonder-AfA können bei Buy-and-Hold-Strategien erhebliche Steuervorteile generieren. Besonders bei energetischen Sanierungen oder denkmalgeschützten Objekten entstehen attraktive Abschreibungsmöglichkeiten.
  
  
  Fix and Flip: Schnelles Geld oder teure Lektionen?
Fix-and-Flip verspricht schnelle Gewinne durch Aufwertung und Weiterverkauf. Die Realität zeigt: Die meisten Projekte dauern länger und kosten mehr als geplant. Handwerkerengpässe, Materialpreissteigerungen und unvorhergesehene Bauschäden sind Standard, nicht Ausnahme.Die Margen schrumpfen kontinuierlich. Was vor fünf Jahren noch 30-40% Gewinn versprach, reduziert sich heute oft auf 10-15%. Gleichzeitig steigt das Risiko durch strengere Energiestandards und komplexere Bauvorschriften.Erfolgreiche Flipper haben heute ein systematisches Vorgehen entwickelt. Sie spezialisieren sich auf bestimmte Objekttypen, haben feste Handwerkerteams und kennen die lokalen Märkte im Detail. Ohne diese Professionalisierung wird Fix-and-Flip zum Glücksspiel.Die Besteuerung ist brutal: Gewinne aus gewerblichem Handel werden voll versteuert, plus Gewerbesteuer. Bei der aktuellen Steuerlast bleiben vom Bruttogewinn oft weniger als 60% übrig.
  
  
  Der Praxis-Check: Wann funktioniert was?
Buy-and-Hold funktioniert 2025 besonders gut bei:Objekten in wachsenden B-Städten mit attraktiven MietrenditenEnergetisch sanierten Immobilien mit langfristigen MietverträgenPortfolios ab 3-5 Objekten zur RisikostreuungInvestoren mit langfristigem Horizont und solidem EigenkapitalFix-and-Flip macht Sinn bei:Objekten mit klar kalkulierbarem AufwertungspotenzialInvestoren mit Bauexpertise und etablierten HandwerkernetzwerkenMärkten mit hoher Nachfrage nach modernisierten ObjektenAusreichend Liquidität für unvorhergesehene Kostensteigerungen
  
  
  Die Hybrid-Strategie: BRRRR als Kompromiss
Eine zunehmend beliebte Alternative ist die BRRRR-Strategie (Buy, Renovate, Rent, Refinance, Repeat). Sie kombiniert Elemente beider Ansätze: Kauf einer sanierungsbedürftigen Immobilie, Aufwertung, Vermietung und anschließende Refinanzierung.Der Vorteil liegt in der Kapitalhebung. Nach erfolgreicher Sanierung und Neubewertung kann oft das gesamte eingesetzte Eigenkapital wieder herausfinanziert werden. Das Objekt bleibt im Portfolio, das Kapital steht für neue Investitionen zur Verfügung.BRRRR erfordert jedoch präzise Kalkulationen und professionelle Projektsteuerung. Ohne die richtigen Tools zur Bewertung und Kalkulation wird die Strategie schnell zum Risiko. Hier zeigt sich der Wert spezialisierter Analyse-Plattformen wie SmartLandlord.de, die beide Strategien mit präzisen Kalkulationen unterstützen.
  
  
  Fazit: Die Strategie muss zur Situation passen
2025 gibt es keine universell beste Strategie. Buy-and-Hold funktioniert für langfristig orientierte Investoren mit solidem Kapitalstock. Fix-and-Flip eignet sich für erfahrene Investoren mit Bauexpertise und hoher Risikobereitschaft.Entscheidend ist die präzise Analyse jedes einzelnen Objekts. Pauschale Empfehlungen führen in die Irre. Wer erfolgreich sein will, braucht professionelle Kalkulationstools und eine klare Strategie. Die Zeiten, in denen man mit Bauchgefühl reich wurde, sind vorbei.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>KI-Ethik in der Immobilienwirtschaft: Faire und transparente Transaktionen gewährleisten</title><link>https://dev.to/smartlandlord/ki-ethik-in-der-immobilienwirtschaft-faire-und-transparente-transaktionen-gewahrleisten-2al2</link><author>Lukas Schneider</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 16:54:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Die rasante Einführung künstlicher Intelligenz in der Immobilienwirtschaft bringt beispiellose Möglichkeiten für präzisere Bewertungen, effizientere Transaktionen und bessere Investitionsentscheidungen mit sich. Während wir diese technologischen Fortschritte begrüßen, stehen wir auch vor einer kritischen Herausforderung: Wie können wir sicherstellen, dass KI-Systeme ethisch, fair und transparent in einer Branche eingesetzt werden, die für Millionen von Menschen Eigenheim und Investitionsmöglichkeiten bedeutet?In Deutschland, wo Immobilieninvestitionen eine zentrale Rolle in der Vermögensbildung privater Haushalte spielen, ist die ethische Implementierung von KI-Technologien nicht nur wünschenswert – sie ist unerlässlich. Die Komplexität des deutschen Immobilienmarkts mit seinen vielfältigen Regulierungen, regionalen Unterschieden und kulturellen Besonderheiten erfordert KI-Systeme, die nicht nur leistungsfähig, sondern auch verantwortungsvoll gestaltet sind.Dieser Artikel untersucht die kritischen ethischen Überlegungen, die Immobilienprofessionals, Technologieentwickler und Investoren bei der Integration von KI in ihre Geschäftspraktiken berücksichtigen müssen. Wir werden praktische Frameworks für ethische KI-Implementierung erkunden und zeigen, wie verantwortungsvolle Technologieunternehmen wie SmartLandlord diese Prinzipien in ihren Plattformen umsetzen.
  
  
  Die ethischen Grundprinzipien für KI in Immobilien

  
  
  Transparenz und Nachvollziehbarkeit
Warum Transparenz entscheidend ist
Immobilienentscheidungen gehören zu den wichtigsten finanziellen Entscheidungen im Leben der meisten Menschen. Wenn KI-Systeme diese Entscheidungen beeinflussen, müssen Nutzer verstehen können, wie diese Systeme zu ihren Empfehlungen gelangen. Transparenz in KI-Algorithmen schafft Vertrauen und ermöglicht es den Nutzern, informierte Entscheidungen zu treffen.Praktische Umsetzung von TransparenzKlare Erklärung der verwendeten Datenquellen und BewertungskriterienOffenlegung der Gewichtung verschiedener Faktoren in der AnalyseBereitstellung verständlicher Erklärungen für KI-generierte EmpfehlungenDokumentation der Grenzen und Unsicherheiten der KI-Modelle
  
  
  Fairness und Nicht-Diskriminierung
Herausforderungen bei der Voreingenommenheit
KI-Systeme können unbeabsichtigt Vorurteile perpetuieren oder verstärken, die in historischen Daten vorhanden sind. In der Immobilienbranche kann dies zu diskriminierenden Praktiken führen, die bestimmte Bevölkerungsgruppen benachteiligen. Dies ist besonders problematisch in einem Land wie Deutschland mit seiner vielfältigen Bevölkerung und seinem starken Engagement für Gleichberechtigung.Maßnahmen zur Gewährleistung von FairnessRegelmäßige Überprüfung der Algorithmen auf potenzielle VoreingenommenheitDiverse Trainingsdaten, die alle Bevölkerungsgruppen repräsentierenKontinuierliche Überwachung der Ergebnisse auf diskriminierende MusterImplementierung von Korrekturmechanismen bei festgestellten Verzerrungen
  
  
  Datenschutz und Privatsphäre
Schutz sensibler Informationen
Immobilientransaktionen beinhalten hochsensible persönliche und finanzielle Informationen. KI-Systeme müssen diese Daten nicht nur schützen, sondern auch sicherstellen, dass sie nur für die vorgesehenen Zwecke verwendet werden. In Deutschland ist dies durch die DSGVO (Datenschutz-Grundverordnung) zusätzlich reguliert.Best Practices für DatenschutzMinimierung der Datensammlung auf das notwendige MaßStarke Verschlüsselung und SicherheitsmaßnahmenKlare Einwilligungen und Opt-out-Möglichkeiten für NutzerRegelmäßige Löschung nicht mehr benötigter Daten
  
  
  Spezifische ethische Herausforderungen im deutschen Immobilienmarkt

  
  
  Regionale Disparitäten und soziale Gerechtigkeit
Deutschland weist erhebliche regionale Unterschiede in Immobilienpreisen und -verfügbarkeit auf. KI-Systeme müssen sicherstellen, dass sie diese Disparitäten nicht verstärken oder bestimmte Regionen systematisch benachteiligen.Vermeidung der Verstärkung von Stadt-Land-GefällenBerücksichtigung sozialer Faktoren neben rein wirtschaftlichen KennzahlenUnterstützung bezahlbaren Wohnraums durch ausgewogene BewertungsalgorithmenFörderung einer nachhaltigen Stadtentwicklung
  
  
  Energieeffizienz und Nachhaltigkeit
Mit dem deutschen Fokus auf Energiewende und Klimaschutz müssen KI-Systeme ethische Überlegungen zur Nachhaltigkeit in ihre Bewertungen integrieren.NachhaltigkeitsintegrationBevorzugung energieeffizienter Immobilien in EmpfehlungsalgorithmenBerücksichtigung langfristiger Umweltauswirkungen bei InvestitionsbewertungenFörderung von Renovierungen zur Verbesserung der EnergieeffizienzTransparenz über ökologische Bewertungskriterien
  
  
  Mieterschutz und soziale Verantwortung
Der deutsche Mieterschutz ist umfassend, und KI-Systeme müssen diese sozialen Schutzmaßnahmen respektieren und unterstützen.Berücksichtigung von Mietpreisbremsen in der BewertungVermeidung von Algorithmen, die zu Verdrängung führen könntenUnterstützung fairer MietpreisentwicklungTransparenz bei mietrelevanten Bewertungsfaktoren
  
  
  Implementierung ethischer KI-Praktiken

  
  
  Entwicklung ethischer Richtlinien
Organisatorische Frameworks
Immobilienunternehmen sollten umfassende ethische Richtlinien für den KI-Einsatz entwickeln, die folgende Elemente umfassen:Klare Prinzipien für ethische KI-NutzungVerantwortlichkeiten und Governance-StrukturenRegelmäßige Überprüfungs- und AnpassungsprozesseSchulungen für Mitarbeiter zu ethischen KI-PraktikenAlgorithmische KontrollmechanismenImplementierung von Bias-Detection-ToolsRegelmäßige Audits der KI-SystemeA/B-Testing zur Identifikation problematischer MusterFeedback-Schleifen zur kontinuierlichen VerbesserungEinbeziehung aller BeteiligtenKonsultationen mit VerbraucherschutzorganisationenDialog mit RegulierungsbehördenFeedback von Endnutzern und BranchenexpertenZusammenarbeit mit Forschungseinrichtungen

But here’s the truth bomb: AI is no longer reserved for tech giants. In 2025, AI is more accessible, more affordable, and way more powerful than ever before—and small businesses are finally getting a seat at the table.If you run a small business, it’s time to ditch the myth that AI is too complicated, too expensive, or simply “not for you.” Whether you’re a local bakery, a solo marketing consultant, or running a growing e-commerce brand, AI can help you work smarter, save money, and scale like never before.Let’s break down how—and why—AI could be your business’s new best friend.Customer Service, UpgradedGot more customer inquiries than your small team can handle? AI chatbots and virtual assistants can swoop in and save the day. Tools like ChatGPT, Tidio, or Intercom AI can respond to common questions 24/7, book appointments, recommend products, or even help troubleshoot issues.The best part? Your customers don’t have to wait—and your team can focus on more strategic work. Win-win.Marketing Magic Without a Big AgencyCreating content, planning campaigns, writing emails… it’s a full-time job (or three). But now, AI marketing tools are doing the heavy lifting for small businesses.Platforms like Jasper, Copy.ai, or HubSpot’s AI content assistant can generate social media captions, blog posts, and ad copy in minutes. AI can also analyze your customer data and tell you exactly what kind of content resonates best with your audience.No more guesswork. Just smarter, faster marketing that actually works.Smarter Sales—Even if You Hate SellingAI can track customer behavior and help you figure out who’s ready to buy—and what they’re most likely to purchase. Think of it like having your own data scientist in your pocket.With tools like Zoho CRM, Pipedrive AI, or HubSpot, you can see when customers open emails, visit your website, or abandon carts—and automatically follow up with the perfect message.It’s like reading minds… but way less creepy.Inventory and Operations? AI’s Got YouRunning out of stock? Ordering too much? Struggling with scheduling or logistics? AI doesn’t just handle “techy” stuff—it’s a genius at operations too.Smart inventory tools can forecast demand, recommend restocks, or even automate orders. AI can also optimize delivery routes, streamline scheduling, and reduce waste.For brick-and-mortar shops, restaurants, or service businesses, this means fewer headaches and more profits.Personalization That Builds LoyaltyAI helps small businesses give customers a “big brand” experience. You can tailor product recommendations, emails, and discounts based on customer behavior and preferences—just like Amazon does.With tools like Shopify’s AI recommendations, Mailchimp’s AI-driven email campaigns, or even simple plugins for WooCommerce, you can create unique experiences for every shopper. And when customers feel seen? They come back.Leveling the Playing FieldHere’s the real game-changer: AI helps you compete. It bridges the resource gap between small businesses and big corporations.You might not have a 50-person marketing team or a massive R&D budget—but with AI, you can automate repetitive tasks, make data-driven decisions, and deliver top-tier experiences just like the big guys.AI doesn’t just make you more efficient—it makes you more effective.
Final Thoughts: No Lab Coat RequiredYou don’t need to be a data scientist to start using AI. Most modern AI tools are built with small businesses in mind—easy to use, affordable, and scalable. Whether you want to boost your sales, save time, or improve customer experience, AI can make it happen.Start small. Pick one tool or one area—like automating customer support or optimizing your email marketing—and test it out. Once you see the results, you’ll wonder how you ever ran your business without it.So no, AI isn’t just for tech giants anymore. It’s for you. The small business owner. The solopreneur. The local legend.The future of business is smart, and you don’t have to be big to win big.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Automatisierte Immobilienverwaltung: KI-Lösungen für Vermieter</title><link>https://dev.to/smartlandlord/automatisierte-immobilienverwaltung-ki-losungen-fur-vermieter-3nlp</link><author>Lukas Schneider</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 16:48:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Die Verwaltung von Mietimmobilien war lange Zeit ein arbeitsintensiver, fehleranfälliger Prozess, der Vermieter vor tägliche Herausforderungen stellte.

Mainly it's heavily in use for LLM-based apps, chatbots AI customer support, internal knowledge assistants etc.Let's create a ticker-specific RAG database table example using Pinecone. In my project I needed to map stock, crypto name: ticker symbols to extract just the ticker symbol. I have as well a Youtube video what you can check bellow. 👇️As mentioned I used Pinecone but there are as well other options like using Reddis and even Postgres has some support.
So ones you have created an account create a new index(table)There are many options and it depends of course on the LLM model you use. If you use GPT then by all means use one of the predefined GPT embeddings. There is as well Llama and Microsoft configuration, for my use case I made a "Manual configuration" due to embeddings based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model in HuggingFace. It's really important to setup configs correctly as otherwise embeddings won't work. My Metric: cosine, Dimensions: 384, Type: Dense your's however may differ.Ones created and running extract your API key and add to your .env for further embeddings.Bellow you can see fraction of my .csv just to get a glimpse what I am embeddingtext,label
TSLA,Tesla
AAPL,Apple
MSFT,Microsoft
BABA,Alibaba Group Holding Limited
...
For LLM I recommend using Jupyter or Google Colab rather then a regular IDE.import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from datasets import load_dataset
from pinecone import Pinecone

load_dotenv()
pc_api_key= os.getenv("PINECONE_API_KEY")

dataset = load_dataset("Mozes721/stock-crypto-weather-dataset", data_files="crypto_mapppings.csv")
df = dataset["train"].to_pandas()
In above code I just import required packages like pinecone, and sentence_transformers used for embeddings. I stored my training data in https://huggingface.co/new-dataset due to the fact it's LLM related same as for fine tunning rather then locally, but that is individual choice.# Step 2: Create alias map
alias_to_ticker = {}

for _, row in df.iterrows():
    ticker = row['text'].upper()
    name = row['label'].lower()
    alias_to_ticker[ticker] = ticker
    alias_to_ticker[name] = ticker
    # Optional: add lowercase ticker too
    alias_to_ticker[ticker.lower()] = ticker

# Step 3: Prepare for embedding
aliases = list(alias_to_ticker.keys())
tickers = [alias_to_ticker[a] for a in aliases]

# Embed
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
embeddings = model.encode(aliases, convert_to_numpy=True)

# Step 5: Load Pinecone table
pc = Pinecone(api_key=pc_api_key)
index = pc.Index("stock-index")
So alias map is created and in the for loop iterate over rows on text and label. Append to alias tuple both name and ticker( in my mappings it should work on both ends if AAPL given should return AAPL if Apple then AAPL). Then we fetch the model we want to embed it to and encode by converting to numpy ad then for now just load the index table.# Prepare vectors in correct format
vectors = []
for i in range(len(aliases)):
    vectors.append({
        "id": f"stock_{i}",
        "values": embeddings[i].tolist(),
        "metadata": {"ticker": tickers[i], "alias": aliases[i]}
    })

# Batch upsert to avoid 2MB limit
batch_size = 50
total_batches = (len(vectors) + batch_size - 1) // batch_size

for i in range(0, len(vectors), batch_size):
    batch = vectors[i:i + batch_size]
    index.upsert(vectors=batch)
    batch_num = i // batch_size + 1
    print(f"Batch {batch_num}/{total_batches} has been embedded and uploaded ({len(batch)} vectors)")

print("All city batches completed!")
The vectors should be prepared in an array, we go through a for loop in aliases. Then append to vector and have id, values and metadata defined.Uploading to Pinecone needs to be done in batches to avoid 2MB upsert limit. When its done with batch_size we can upsert to stock-index table.The testing face should be quite simple as long as data has been embedded properly and same LLM model is used.]import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from pinecone import (
    Pinecone
)

class EmbeddingStockMapper:
    def __init__(self, model_name: str, pinecone_api_key: str):
        # Initialize the embedding model
        self.model = SentenceTransformer(model_name)

        pc = Pinecone(api_key=pinecone_api_key)
        self.index = pc.Index("stock-index")

    def get_stock_ticker(self, query):
        # Get embedding for the query
        query_embedding = self.model.encode(query, convert_to_numpy=True)

        # Search in Pinecone
        results = self.index.query(
            vector=query_embedding.tolist(),
            top_k=1,
            include_metadata=True
        )

        if results.matches:
            return results.matches[0].metadata['ticker']
        return None

# Initialize the mapper
load_dotenv()
pc_api_key= os.getenv("PINECONE_API_KEY")
mapper = EmbeddingStockMapper(model_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2", pinecone_api_key=pc_api_key)
So we initialize the model with all-MiniLM-L6-v2 same as used before in embedings. Then create a method  that will encode the query passed to it. It will then return a result.matches[0].metadata['ticker'] as per own specification that most closely matches.test_queries = ["AAPL", "Apple Inc.", "apple", "What is the current stock price of Tesla.", "Google", "google", "TSLA", "Tesla", "tesla", "Microsoft Corporation", "microsoft"]

for query in test_queries:
    ticker = mapper.get_stock_ticker(query)
    print(f"Query: {query} -> Ticker: {ticker}")

//Output
Query: AAPL -> Ticker: AAPL
Query: Apple Inc. -> Ticker: AAPL
Query: apple -> Ticker: AAPL
Query: What is the current stock price of Tesla. -> Ticker: TSLA
Query: Google -> Ticker: GOOGL
Query: google -> Ticker: GOOGL
Query: TSLA -> Ticker: TSLA
Query: Tesla -> Ticker: TSLA
Query: tesla -> Ticker: TSLA
Query: Microsoft Corporation -> Ticker: MSFT
Query: microsoft -> Ticker: MSFT
Above you can see how it gracefully returned ticker symbols as per my request!In all honesty I was astonished by the results. RAG is slowly getting traction and I think a this is a lot better approach even if there is a learning curve compared to just using ChatGPT API calls. But most of us have simple need for AI implementation so using the whole AI model can be deemed as an "overkill".

From smart home devices and wearables to industrial sensors and medical equipment, IoT promises unprecedented connectivity and efficiency. However, this pervasive integration also introduces a vast and dynamic attack surface, pushing the limits of traditional, reactive security measures.
  
  
  The Evolving IoT Threat Landscape
Traditional security approaches, often reliant on signature-based detection and perimeter defense, struggle to keep pace with the unique challenges of the IoT ecosystem. IoT devices are incredibly diverse, ranging in computational power, operating systems, and communication protocols. Many are deployed with minimal security considerations, often using default credentials or outdated firmware, making them easy targets.The nature of IoT attacks is also evolving. Beyond simple malware infections, we're seeing sophisticated distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks orchestrated by massive botnets of compromised IoT devices (like the Mirai botnet), unauthorized data exfiltration, and even physical disruption in industrial IoT (IIoT) environments. According to a report by JumpCloud, one in three data breaches now involves an IoT device, highlighting the critical need for more robust security. Weak or default passwords, unpatched vulnerabilities, and insecure network configurations are common entry points for attackers. The sheer volume of devices and their constant connectivity mean that a single compromised device can serve as a gateway to an entire corporate network or critical infrastructure.
  
  
  Introduction to Anomaly Detection in IoT
Given the limitations of traditional methods, a paradigm shift towards proactive security is imperative. This is where anomaly detection, particularly when powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), offers a compelling solution.In the context of IoT, anomaly detection involves identifying patterns or behaviors that deviate significantly from what is considered "normal" or expected for a particular device or network segment. Instead of looking for known malicious signatures, anomaly detection focuses on understanding the baseline behavior of IoT devices and flagging anything unusual.The benefits of this approach are substantial:Early Threat Identification: Anomalies can be detected as soon as they occur, often before they escalate into full-blown security incidents. By learning the normal behavior, AI/ML models can often distinguish between legitimate, unusual activity and actual malicious intent, reducing the noise that plagues signature-based systems.Adaptation to New Threats: Unlike signature-based systems that require constant updates for new threats, anomaly detection can identify novel or zero-day attacks by flagging their unusual patterns. It can monitor various aspects of IoT device operation, from network traffic and resource utilization to sensor readings and user interactions.
  
  
  How AI/ML Powers IoT Anomaly Detection
The core of AI-powered anomaly detection lies in its ability to learn complex patterns from vast amounts of data. Machine learning algorithms are trained on datasets representing normal IoT device behavior, enabling them to build a robust understanding of what constitutes "normal."
  
  
  Machine Learning Algorithms
Several ML algorithms are well-suited for anomaly detection in IoT: An ensemble method that "isolates" anomalies by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature. Anomalies are typically easier to isolate and require fewer splits than normal data points.One-Class SVM (Support Vector Machine): A supervised algorithm trained on a dataset containing only "normal" examples. It learns a decision boundary that encapsulates the normal data, classifying any data point outside this boundary as an anomaly. An unsupervised algorithm that groups similar data points into clusters. Anomalies are often identified as data points that are far from any cluster centroid or belong to very small, isolated clusters. A type of neural network used for unsupervised learning. An autoencoder learns to compress and then reconstruct its input data. When trained on normal data, it struggles to accurately reconstruct anomalous data, leading to a high reconstruction error, which can be used to identify anomalies.Effective anomaly detection relies on rich and diverse data sources from IoT devices and networks: Packet size, connection duration, destination IPs, protocols used, frequency of communication. System events, error messages, access attempts, configuration changes. Temperature, humidity, pressure, motion detection (for industrial or environmental IoT). Regular usage times, typical command sequences, resource utilization (CPU, memory).Raw IoT data often needs to be transformed into meaningful features that ML algorithms can understand. This process, known as feature engineering, is crucial for the model's performance. For instance, from raw network packets, features like "bytes per second," "number of unique connections," or "ratio of inbound to outbound traffic" can be extracted. For device logs, features might include "frequency of failed login attempts" or "number of unique error codes."
  
  
  Practical Implementation: A Simple Anomaly Detection System (with Python Code Example)
To illustrate these concepts, let's consider a simplified scenario: a smart home network with various IoT devices like thermostats, smart locks, and security cameras. We'll build a basic anomaly detection system using Python and the  library's Isolation Forest model.The goal is to simulate IoT network traffic and train a model to identify unusual patterns that could indicate a security breach or malfunction. For more comprehensive guidance on securing your IoT devices, refer to the securing-iot-devices-guide.pages.dev resource. This function creates synthetic IoT network traffic data. It simulates features like , , and  for different s. Crucially, it injects a small percentage of "anomalies" by making  and  unusually high, mimicking a potential attack or malfunction. This function takes the generated data and trains an  model. The  parameter helps the model estimate the proportion of anomalies in the dataset. The model learns the normal patterns from the features. This function simulates real-time monitoring. It continuously generates new data points, occasionally introducing an anomaly. It then uses the trained  to predict whether the new data point is normal (1) or an anomaly (-1). If an anomaly is detected, an alert is printed.if __name__ == "__main__":: This block orchestrates the process. It first generates training data and trains the model. Then, it starts the  function in a separate thread to simulate continuous monitoring without blocking the main program. The  keeps the main thread alive to observe the monitoring output.This example provides a foundational understanding. Real-world implementations would involve more sophisticated data collection, feature engineering, model selection, and deployment strategies.
  
  
  Challenges and Future Directions
While AI-powered anomaly detection offers immense promise, several challenges need to be addressed:Data Scarcity and Quality: Obtaining large, labeled datasets of anomalous IoT behavior is difficult and expensive. Most real-world data represents normal operation. Techniques like synthetic data generation, active learning, and semi-supervised learning are being explored to mitigate this. Many IoT devices have limited computational power, memory, and battery life. Running complex ML models directly on these devices ("edge AI") requires highly optimized and lightweight algorithms. The "normal" behavior of an IoT device can change over time due to software updates, environmental changes, or new usage patterns. Models need to be adaptive and capable of retraining or continuously learning to avoid flagging legitimate changes as anomalies. Understanding  an AI model flagged something as an anomaly can be challenging, especially with complex deep learning models. Improved interpretability is crucial for security analysts to respond effectively.Future directions in IoT security with AI/ML include: This approach allows models to be trained on decentralized datasets residing on individual IoT devices or edge gateways, without centralizing the raw data. This preserves privacy and reduces data transfer overhead, making it ideal for large, distributed IoT deployments. Pushing AI processing closer to the data source (on the edge device itself or a nearby gateway) reduces latency, conserves bandwidth, and enhances privacy. TinyML focuses on enabling machine learning on extremely low-power, resource-constrained microcontrollers. Exploring reinforcement learning for adaptive security policies and proactive defense mechanisms that can learn from interactions with the environment and autonomously adjust to new threats.Blockchain for IoT Security: Integrating blockchain for secure device identity, immutable audit trails, and decentralized trust mechanisms can complement AI-driven anomaly detection.The proliferation of IoT devices necessitates a fundamental shift in our approach to security. Relying solely on reactive, signature-based methods is no longer sufficient to protect against the dynamic and increasingly sophisticated threats targeting connected environments. AI and Machine Learning, particularly through anomaly detection, offer a powerful and proactive defense mechanism. By enabling devices and networks to learn and understand "normal" behavior, we can identify deviations as they occur, providing early warnings and adapting to novel attacks. While challenges remain, the continuous advancements in AI, coupled with innovative architectural patterns like federated learning and edge AI, are paving the way for a more resilient and secure IoT future. Embracing these technologies is not just an advantage; it's a necessity for safeguarding our increasingly connected world.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What Are Limitations Of Current Generative AI Systems?</title><link>https://dev.to/shriyansh_iot_98734929139/what-are-limitations-of-current-generative-ai-systems-2i45</link><author>Shriyansh IOT</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 13:52:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Generative AI systems, despite their impressive capabilities, still face several limitations. One key issue is bias in training data, which can lead to biased or unfair outputs. Since these models learn from large datasets scraped from the internet, they often inherit existing social, cultural, or political biases. Another major limitation is factual inaccuracy. Generative AI can produce convincing but incorrect or misleading information, as it lacks true understanding and only predicts text based on patterns.Additionally, these systems are resource-intensive, requiring significant computational power, energy, and data to train and run efficiently, which limits accessibility. There’s also the challenge of limited contextual understanding while AI can mimic human conversation or creativity, it doesn’t possess real-world awareness, emotions, or reasoning abilities. In creative tasks, generative AI can produce repetitive or derivative content rather than genuinely novel ideas.Security and misuse are other pressing concerns. Generative models can be used to create deepfakes, fake news, or phishing content, raising ethical and safety issues. Finally, the lack of transparency in how these models make decisions often called the “black box” problem makes it difficult to explain or trust outputs.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Project KARL - AI</title><link>https://dev.to/theaniketraj/project-karl-ai-5g37</link><author>Aniket Raj</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 13:37:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

But just using it doesn’t mean you’ve mastered it. Like any powerful tool, its real value comes from how well you use it, not just how often.Used well, ChatGPT can be a serious productivity boost. It can help you debug faster, analyze complex codebases, scaffold APIs, automate workflows, and stay in flow during long coding sessions.In this post, I'll break down 5 advanced ChatGPT prompting techniques for developers, each built for real-world use. Whether you’re trying to ship faster, write cleaner code, or streamline your workflow, these prompts will help you get more value out of every session.1. Rolling Context Summaries2. Prompt Structuring for Cleaner, Faster Output3. Maximizing API Credits Without Losing Output Quality4. Customizing ChatGPT to Match Your WorkflowConclusion: Tools Only Help with Structure and Scale
  
  
  1. Rolling Context Summaries
One of the biggest limits when using ChatGPT for real development is its context window. ChatGPT can only “remember” about 128,000 tokens (roughly 80,000 words) in a conversation. When your code, logs, and conversation history get longer than that, it starts dropping the earliest parts — effectively forgetting what you told it at the start.This causes problems in long debugging sessions or complex multi-file analysis where you need consistent understanding across many messages.The best way to handle this is with rolling context summaries. After working through a chunk of code or conversation, say every 20–30 messages, ask ChatGPT to summarize the key points so far in a few bullet points.“Summarize our last 20 messages in 5 bullet points focusing on the main issues and solutions.”Save that summary outside ChatGPT. When you start a new session or hit the token limit, paste the summary back into the prompt before continuing:“Here’s what we covered before: [paste summary]. Now let’s continue debugging the payment module.”If your sessions get very long, break them into smaller chunks and summarize each. This method keeps ChatGPT informed without repeating everything and prevents loss of context.Without rolling summaries, ChatGPT forgets critical details, forcing you to repeat or re-explain context. Using summaries keeps workflows smooth and productive, especially for multi-file code reviews, long debugging sessions, or iterative problem solving.
  
  
  2. Prompt Structuring for Cleaner, Faster Output
Even with good context management, poor prompts can still derail a session. Most code generation issues don’t come from the model being incapable, they come from instructions that are too vague or too open-ended. Left to guess, the model often produces overly verbose, unstructured, or incomplete results.The best way to avoid this is by using simple, repeatable prompt patterns that keep the model focused on what you want and only what you want.When working with code, a good baseline is:"Respond with code only in CODE SNIPPET format, no explanations."This keeps responses clean and accurate. You don’t need paragraph-long explanations in the middle of a coding session, just working code you can drop in and test. Removing unnecessary output also makes it easier to see whether the result actually changed.When iterating on an existing file or component, these two are especially useful:"Just provide the parts that need to be modified.""Provide entire updated component."The first is ideal for small tweaks. It avoids confusion from unchanged code being repeated. The second is better when changes affect multiple areas or when you want a fresh, consistent copy of the full component.Over time, using these phrases becomes second nature. You can even save them as text snippets or shortcut keys in your setup (for example, using a browser extension or editor plugin) to save time during repeated prompting.Without prompt structuring, LLMs tend to guess. That guesswork leads to bloated responses, wrong assumptions, or missed details. With structured prompts, responses are consistent and focused, helping you stay in flow, especially when working on large projects or switching between tasks frequently.
  
  
  3. Maximizing API Credits Without Losing Output Quality
When working with the ChatGPT API — especially in iterative development workflows, it’s easy to burn through tokens without realizing it. Every message costs credits, and long prompts or verbose replies can quickly accumulate. But with a few simple habits, you can keep costs low while still getting high-quality output.The most effective strategy is to optimize both the prompt and the model selection. Start with concise, tightly scoped instructions:“Explain Python classes with one short example.”“Fix the code, explain the issue, and suggest optimizations.”“Answer in under 100 words.”These kinds of constraints help control both input and output token counts. They also make it easier to test and read results. If you’re using the API directly, set  to explicitly cap responses — useful for automating safeguards on repeated queries.For simpler tasks like debugging, drafting snippets, or summarizing logs, switch to lighter models like  or . Reserve  for final-stage refinement, complex reasoning, or critical correctness. This is the same strategy developers on Reddit use to stretch credit limits — do 80% of the work with cheaper models, and only escalate when needed.To avoid redundant calls, . If you’ve already asked the model to explain a type error or a specific regex function, save that answer locally or in a shared store. When the same issue comes up again, just reuse the result. This is especially useful if you’re building tools that field similar prompts repeatedly.You can also . Instead of three back-and-forths (“Fix this,” then “Explain it,” then “Suggest improvements”), just ask:“Fix this code, explain what was wrong, and suggest how to make it cleaner.”If follow-ups are likely, include them proactively:“If you find a bug, fix it. If the logic is unclear, simplify it.”This compresses multiple interactions into a single, efficient exchange.To monitor usage, set a  in OpenAI’s dashboard. For deeper control, use libraries like  to estimate message cost before sending, or implement per-user rate limits if you’re building against the API. These tools help you stay ahead of overages, especially when usage spikes unexpectedly during testing or scaling.Finally, when refining prompts over and over, reduce wasted iterations by:Drafting prompts locally before calling the API
Reusing the  array to preserve prior context without resending full logs
Embedding potential tweaks in the initial request (“If it fails, suggest alternatives.”)Small optimizations like these add up quickly, especially in high-volume use. With structured prompting, smart model selection, and a few guardrails, it’s possible to run large, useful sessions while staying well under credit limits.
  
  
  4. Customizing ChatGPT to Match Your Workflow
Once you’ve optimized your context, prompting, and credit usage, the next step is tailoring ChatGPT to your specific use case. Out of the box, the model is general-purpose, but with a few small changes, you can make it behave more like a teammate that understands your coding style, preferences, and domain.The most effective way to do this is through custom instructions. These let you define how ChatGPT should behave and what kind of responses you want. For example:“You are a concise Python developer who always includes type hints.”“When asked to refactor code, always explain changes in a bullet list.”“Keep responses under 150 words unless otherwise requested.”You can set this once and have it apply to every session, saving time and reducing the need for repetitive prompt engineering. In API calls, this works by prepending a system message (e.g., {"role": "system", "content": "You are..."}), while in the ChatGPT UI, it lives under custom settings.For even more control, use function calling or tools integration. This allows ChatGPT to return structured outputs (like JSON) or interact with your codebase, APIs, or tools. You can use this to:Automate workflows (e.g., trigger actions after a valid response)
Extract structured data for parsing
Return only the function signature or schema, not the implementation
In dev-focused environments, this reduces the need for cleanup and lets you treat model output like an extension of your code editor.If you’re using ChatGPT for team or product work, you can also create custom GPTs. These let you define tools, upload files, set behavior, and even brand the experience. Think of it as building a domain-specific assistant that’s tuned to your stack, tone, and expectations.Finally, you can teach the model about your style through priming examples. These are simple examples of input/output pairs that show what kind of response you want. For example:“When I say: ‘clean this up’, here’s what I expect...”  “When I give you code like this, reformat it like this.”Providing one or two examples early in a session can guide the model for the rest of the conversation, especially helpful for maintaining consistency across multiple outputs.Customizing ChatGPT is about automation and delegation. Whether through system messages, API-level behaviors, or primed examples, the goal is to shape the assistant so you spend less time explaining and more time building.
  
  
  Conclusion: Tools Only Help with Structure and Scale
At the end of the day, tools like ChatGPT don’t think for you. They extend your reach. They help with structure, by organizing and accelerating the tasks you already understand, and with scale, by letting you iterate faster, respond quicker, and offload the repetitive parts of coding or writing.But they can’t replace clarity of thought, sound judgment, or domain knowledge. You still have to guide the tool with tight prompts, sharp context, and a clear objective. The better your inputs, the more useful your outputs.Used well, ChatGPT becomes less of a chatbot and more of a collaborative assistant. Something that helps you stay focused, move faster, and work at a higher level — without burning time or budget.The more intentional your workflow, the more value you’ll get out of every session.If this helped, I’ve got more like it — tools, tips, and honest takes on dev workflow.

The company has started adding labels to albums that include AI-generated music.This move comes as the platform sees a surge in songs made entirely by artificial intelligence — many of which are being used to game the system for royalty payouts.
  
  
  AI Music Is Booming — And So Is Abuse
Every day, over 20,000 AI-generated tracks are uploaded to Deezer. That’s about 18% of all new music on the platform.While most of those songs don’t become hits, Deezer says 70% of their streams are fake — boosted by bots or click farms to earn royalties.Clearly labeling albums that contain AI-generated tracksRemoving AI-only songs from editorial playlists and algorithm recommendationsBlocking fake streams from being counted in royalty payments
  
  
  Why Deezer Says Labels Matter
The company says these new labels will help listeners easily spot AI-made music — and decide for themselves what they want to hear.“We’ve seen a sharp rise in AI-only tracks lately,” said Deezer CEO Alexis Lanternier. “We’re not against AI, but users deserve to know what they’re listening to.”He added, “Being transparent is key. We also want to protect the rights of real artists and songwriters, especially as AI blurs the lines of copyright.”
  
  
  So, How Big Is the AI Music Problem?
Right now, AI-only songs make up just 0.5% of total streams on Deezer. But the company says that number is growing fast — and the issue isn’t going away anytime soon.That’s why Deezer is trying to act early, before the flood of synthetic music overwhelms human-made content on streaming platforms.
  
  
  Detecting AI with Patents and Technology
Deezer has also developed its own AI detection tools. In late 2024, the company applied for two patents focused on identifying the “digital fingerprints” of AI-generated audio.These tools allow Deezer to scan uploads and spot which tracks were made by machines instead of humans.
  
  
  Meanwhile, Music Giants Are in Talks with AI Startups
The timing of Deezer’s move is no coincidence. Right now, Universal Music Group, Sony Music, and Warner Music Group are reportedly negotiating with AI music startups like Udio and Suno.Those same startups are being sued for copyright violations by the labels. Licensing deals could help settle the lawsuits — but the industry is still divided over how to handle AI-generated music.Deezer is now labeling albums that include AI-made songs.AI-only tracks are excluded from playlists and recommendations.About 18% of new uploads are now AI-generated.Deezer says 70% of streams for AI tracks are fraudulent.The company has filed patents for AI detection to help identify synthetic content.Other big music labels are still figuring out how to work with or fight AI music.As AI tools make it easier than ever to create music, streaming platforms are being forced to adapt — fast.Deezer’s approach focuses on transparency and fairness, making sure listeners know what they’re hearing and that artists aren’t cheated out of royalties.With AI in music growing quickly, this may be the start of a new era where every track needs a label — human or machine.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>cookie</title><link>https://dev.to/jim12323/c-1gda</link><author>Jim</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 13:25:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Exploring Cookie Clicker: The Addictive Incremental Game That Keeps You Clicking

Let’s explore the emotions, illusions, and realities that come with that moment, especially as we enter the era of AI-assisted development.Opening a new file in your favorite editor is like standing at the edge of possibility. The blank page is pure potential — what you write, how you structure it, which problems you solve, and the architecture you choose are all up to you. It feels empowering, almost omnipotent. But as you so insightfully put it, this is also an illusion.Every decision — how to organize code, which frameworks to use, what the CI/CD pipeline will look like—seems to offer control. But as any experienced developer knows, the further you go, the more you realize how many factors are outside your control:Unknown unknowns become known (sometimes painfully).Even with 100% test coverage, you’re only certain about the scenarios you’ve imagined. The real world always finds a way to surprise you.Programming is not deterministic. It’s a creative, iterative, and often messy process. The sense of control is comforting, but it’s also fragile. As you said, we live with the illusion of control—hoping that our tests, our architecture, and our processes will be enough.But the truth is, software is never finished. It’s only ever in a state of “good enough for now.” The blank page is a reminder of both the freedom and the uncertainty inherent in our craft.Now, with AI tools like PBR (AI Dev Tasks!), Sonnet, and others, the dynamic is shifting. The blank page is no longer just yours to fill; it’s a collaborative canvas. You can offload the tedious parts, accelerate architecture design, and iterate at a speed that was unimaginable a few years ago.Requirements Gathering: AI can help formalize and structure requirements, reducing ambiguity.Architecture: Generate high-level designs, diagrams, and documentation in minutes.Gap Analysis: Instantly compare code and architecture, surfacing inconsistencies.Task Decomposition: Break down large problems into manageable increments.This shortens the feedback loop dramatically. What once took weeks now takes hours.But there’s a tradeoff. As AI generates more of the code, the risk is that humans lose touch with the codebase. If you don’t review, test, and understand what’s being produced, you lose control. The code becomes alien, and the illusion of control becomes even more dangerous.QA Becomes Critical: With AI hallucinations and unpredictable outputs, rigorous testing and code review are more important than ever.Continuous Review: Each increment must be checked, not just for correctness, but for maintainability and alignment with the original vision.Human Guidance: AI is powerful, but it still needs human direction, intuition, and judgment.We’re already living in this new world, even if we haven’t fully realized it. The blank page is no longer a solitary challenge — it’s an invitation to collaborate, to experiment, and to embrace uncertainty with powerful new tools at our side.The blank page is both exhilarating and daunting.The illusion of control is comforting but incomplete.AI is transforming how we approach software creation, but it introduces new risks.The human role is evolving—from sole creator to orchestrator, reviewer, and guide.And that’s a beautiful thing.Sincerely yours,
A fellow architect, coder, and explorer of the blank page.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Psychological Sales Page Architecture™</title><link>https://dev.to/monna/psychological-sales-page-architecture-472o</link><author>monna</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 12:36:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[*

Traditional security approaches often become bottlenecks, struggling to keep up with the speed and scale of development. This is where DevSecOps, a philosophy that integrates security into every stage of the software development lifecycle, becomes critical. Now, with the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI), DevSecOps is undergoing a transformative shift, moving beyond simple automation to embrace intelligent, proactive, and highly efficient security workflows. AI is becoming indispensable in addressing the increasing complexity and volume of cyber threats, enabling organizations to secure their digital assets from initial code commit to cloud deployment and runtime protection. As noted by Istari Global, automation, coupled with AI, is at the forefront of driving operational efficiency in security, allowing security teams to focus on strategic initiatives while AI handles operational functions, leading to greater precision and agility in responding to threats.
  
  
  Intelligent Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools analyze source code, bytecode, or binary code to identify vulnerabilities before the application is run. While effective, traditional SAST tools often generate a high volume of alerts, leading to "false positives" that consume valuable developer time. AI significantly enhances SAST by employing machine learning algorithms to analyze code patterns, understand context, and learn from past remediation efforts. This enables AI-powered SAST to reduce false positives, prioritize critical vulnerabilities based on their actual risk and impact, and provide more accurate and actionable remediation guidance.For example, a hypothetical AI-powered SAST tool's output might look like this:Vulnerability Report - AI-Enhanced SAST

Project: UserAuthService
Commit: 8f7e6d5cba1234567890abcdef

High Priority Vulnerabilities (AI-Prioritized):

1.  **CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in SQL Command ('SQL Injection')**

        *   *Reference:* OWASP Top 10 A07:2021 – Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Medium Priority Vulnerabilities:

*   ... (less critical issues with lower AI confidence scores)
This output provides not just the vulnerability but also an AI-driven confidence score, a clear description of the risk, and precise, context-aware remediation suggestions, significantly streamlining the developer's work.
  
  
  Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) with AI
Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) examines applications in their running state, simulating attacks to identify vulnerabilities. AI elevates DAST by enabling tools to intelligently explore the application's attack surface, adapt to changes in the application's structure and behavior, and even identify complex business logic flaws that traditional DAST might miss. AI-powered DAST can learn from application interactions, understand user flows, and dynamically generate test cases, leading to more comprehensive and efficient vulnerability discovery.
  
  
  AI for Vulnerability Management and Prioritization
The sheer volume of vulnerability data, coupled with a constant influx of new threats, makes effective vulnerability management a daunting task. Machine learning algorithms are proving invaluable here, capable of analyzing vast amounts of vulnerability data, threat intelligence feeds, and business context (e.g., asset criticality, exposure) to prioritize remediation efforts effectively. AI can predict which vulnerabilities are most likely to be exploited, which assets are most at risk, and which fixes will yield the highest security improvement, allowing security teams to allocate resources where they are most impactful. This shift from reactive patching to proactive, risk-based remediation is a significant step forward in DevSecOps.
  
  
  Automated Incident Response and Remediation
AI's role extends beyond detection into automated incident response and remediation. AI-driven security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) platforms can automatically detect security incidents, perform initial analysis, and trigger predefined response actions. This includes everything from isolating compromised systems and blocking malicious IP addresses to even deploying automated patches or configuration changes. This rapid, AI-driven response significantly reduces the mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to respond (MTTR) to security incidents, minimizing potential damage.Consider a conceptual YAML pipeline demonstrating an automated remediation step triggered by an AI-identified threat:This pipeline, triggered by an AI security alert, can execute different remediation actions based on the alert's severity and recommended action, demonstrating the power of intelligent, automated response.
  
  
  Cloud-Native Security and AI
The dynamic and ephemeral nature of cloud-native environments (containers, serverless functions, microservices) presents unique security challenges. AI is instrumental in securing these complex landscapes. AI-powered tools provide intelligent Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) by continuously monitoring cloud configurations for misconfigurations and policy violations. They can detect anomalous behavior in containerized workloads, identify unauthorized access to serverless functions, and even predict potential attack paths within a dynamic cloud infrastructure. This allows for proactive identification and remediation of risks in an ever-changing cloud environment. For more insights on securing cloud environments, explore the resources on DevSecOps lifecycle integration.
  
  
  Challenges and Considerations
While the benefits of AI in DevSecOps are immense, it's crucial to acknowledge the challenges and considerations. Ethical implications, such as algorithmic bias in threat detection or automated decision-making, must be carefully managed. Data privacy concerns are paramount, as AI systems often require access to sensitive code, application, and threat data. The need for human oversight remains critical; AI should augment, not replace, human security expertise. Furthermore, the importance of explainable AI (XAI) in security decisions cannot be overstated. Security professionals need to understand  an AI system flagged a particular vulnerability or recommended a specific action to build trust and ensure accountability.The future of AI-powered DevSecOps is poised for even greater innovation. We can anticipate the emergence of autonomous security agents capable of self-healing applications and infrastructure in real-time, responding to threats with minimal human intervention. More sophisticated predictive threat intelligence, powered by advanced AI models, will enable organizations to anticipate and neutralize threats before they even materialize. As AI continues to evolve, its integration into DevSecOps will lead to increasingly resilient, self-securing software systems, fundamentally changing the paradigm of cybersecurity. As highlighted by Security Senses, AI-powered tools are becoming more accessible, offering intelligent insights into vulnerabilities and attack patterns, promising to make security more adaptive and less reliant on manual intervention.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>📢 Supervised Agentic AI Project</title><link>https://dev.to/canmingir/supervised-agentic-ai-project-4c16</link><author>Can Mingir</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 11:29:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We’re launching an open-source, supervised AI agent platform built for Human–AI collaboration.🎯 Supervised Learning

By 2025, the search display has changed because of zero-click searches, where Google provides the answer to the query on the result page.Due to AI Overviews, Featured Snippets, People Also Ask boxes, and the rise of the Search Generative Experience (SGE), users are likely to get what they sought without even going to a site.If your strategy still revolves around blue links and ranking #1, it’s time to pivot.Let’s explore how your brand can stay visible and valuable—even when no one clicks.
  
  
  What Are Zero-Click Searches?
A zero-click search happens when a user gets the answer they need directly on the search results page, without needing to click through to a website. This could be from:AI Overviews (generated summaries by Google)Featured Snippets (paragraphs, lists, tables)People Also Ask dropdownsMaps, videos, weather widgets, and more
As of 2025, more than 60% of all mobile searches result in zero clicks. And with Google’s AI rapidly evolving, that number is climbing.
  
  
  Does That Mean SEO Is Dead?
SEO is evolving. The goal is no longer just traffic. It’s visibility, credibility, and trust. Appearing in zero-click features keeps your brand front-and-center, even if users don’t visit your site right away.
The modern SEO mindset is:"If I can’t win the click, I’ll still win the impression."
Let’s dive into how.
  
  
  10 Tactics to Win in a Zero-Click World

  
  
  1. Optimize for Featured Snippets
Featured snippets still dominate Google’s top real estate.
To win one:Answer specific questions clearly and conciselyUse bullet points or numbered lists for “how-to” and “steps”Include relevant keywords in headers (H2/H3)Aim to answer the query within the first 100 words of your section.
  
  
  2. Structure Content with Clear Hierarchies
Google’s AI and SGE features favor structured content. Use:H3 for supporting detailsTables, lists, bolded summariesThink like a machine: make your content easy to parse, summarize, and display.
  
  
  3. Target Long-Tail and Question-Based Keywords

By defining infrastructure in code, organizations gained unprecedented consistency, speed, and the ability to track changes like software. However, the dawn of Artificial Intelligence (AI) marks the next profound paradigm shift for IaC. AI promises to elevate IaC beyond mere automation, ushering in an era of intelligent, self-optimizing, and even self-healing infrastructure, making cloud management more efficient, accessible, and resilient than ever before.
  
  
  Key AI Applications in IaC Workflows
AI's integration into IaC workflows is multifaceted, touching nearly every stage of the infrastructure lifecycle. From initial design to ongoing operations, AI is enhancing capabilities and introducing new possibilities.
  
  
  Intelligent Code Generation
One of the most exciting applications is the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate IaC directly from natural language descriptions or high-level architectural diagrams. This capability significantly lowers the barrier to entry for developers and accelerates the initial provisioning phase. Imagine a simple prompt like: "Create an AWS S3 bucket for website hosting with public read access." An AI model could translate this into a basic Terraform configuration:
  
  
  Enhanced Code Analysis and Validation
AI can act as an intelligent co-pilot for IaC, assisting in reviewing code for best practices, potential misconfigurations, performance bottlenecks, and critical security vulnerabilities  deployment. This proactive approach helps catch issues that might be missed by human review or traditional static analysis tools. AI can analyze complex interdependencies and suggest optimal configurations, significantly improving the quality and security of deployed infrastructure. As highlighted in "AI-Generated Infrastructure-as-Code: the Good, the Bad and the Ugly" by Styra, while AI can generate code, human oversight remains crucial for validation to prevent "hallucinations" or insecure outputs. The article emphasizes the need for robust policy enforcement and validation layers even with AI-generated IaC.
  
  
  Automated Remediation and Self-Healing Infrastructure
One of the most transformative aspects is the concept of AI agents monitoring infrastructure state in real-time. These agents can compare the live infrastructure against its defined IaC state, identify deviations, and automatically take corrective actions to maintain the desired configuration or resolve issues. This moves beyond simple alerts to true self-healing capabilities, minimizing downtime and reducing the operational burden on engineering teams. As VivaOps.ai discusses in "What's Next for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in 2025: Beyond Automation," the future of IaC involves AI-driven autonomous operations, where systems can predict and prevent issues, rather than just reacting to them.
  
  
  Cost Optimization and Resource Management
Cloud costs can quickly spiral out of control without careful management. AI can analyze IaC definitions in conjunction with actual cloud usage patterns to recommend intelligent optimizations. This includes right-sizing resources (e.g., suggesting smaller EC2 instances or different database tiers), identifying idle or underutilized assets, and predicting future resource needs to prevent over-provisioning. This directly impacts FinOps initiatives, helping organizations achieve significant cost savings.
  
  
  Documentation and Knowledge Management
Maintaining accurate and up-to-date documentation for complex infrastructure is a perennial challenge. AI can automate this process by generating or updating documentation directly from IaC definitions. This ensures that infrastructure knowledge is always current, making it easier for new team members to onboard and for existing teams to understand the infrastructure landscape.
  
  
  Transformative Benefits of AI in IaC
The integration of AI into IaC promises a multitude of benefits that will redefine how organizations manage their cloud environments.Accelerated Development Cycles: AI-powered code generation and intelligent automation lead to faster provisioning and iteration, enabling development teams to deploy applications more rapidly. By automating complex or repetitive tasks and providing intelligent assistance, AI lowers the barrier to entry for developers, reducing the need for deep, infrastructure-specific knowledge.Improved Consistency and Compliance: AI can enforce automated adherence to organizational standards, security policies, and regulatory requirements, ensuring that all deployed infrastructure is consistent and compliant.Enhanced Security Posture: Proactive identification and mitigation of security risks within IaC, combined with self-healing capabilities, significantly strengthen an organization's overall security posture.Greater Operational Efficiency: Automating routine tasks and enabling self-remediation frees up engineers from mundane operational work, allowing them to focus on higher-value strategic initiatives and innovation.
  
  
  Navigating the Challenges and Considerations
While the promise of AI-powered IaC is immense, organizations must address several challenges for successful adoption.Accuracy and "Hallucinations": AI models, especially LLMs, can sometimes generate incorrect or nonsensical outputs ("hallucinations"). Human review and validation of AI-generated code remain critical to prevent errors, insecure configurations, or non-functional infrastructure. Ensuring the AI models themselves are secure and that the generated code doesn't inadvertently introduce new vulnerabilities is paramount. Organizations must establish robust security practices around AI model training and deployment. Fitting new AI tools seamlessly into existing DevOps pipelines, version control systems, and cloud environments can be complex, requiring careful planning and execution.Data Privacy and Governance: AI models often require access to sensitive infrastructure data for training and operation. Managing this data securely and ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations is a significant concern. Understanding how AI makes certain recommendations or generates specific code can be challenging. The lack of transparency in some AI models can hinder debugging and trust, necessitating explainable AI approaches where possible.
  
  
  The Future Outlook: AI Agents, Platform Engineering, and Beyond
The trajectory of AI in IaC points towards increasingly autonomous and intelligent systems. The rise of specialized AI agents for DevOps and Platform Engineering tasks is inevitable. These agents will not just assist but actively participate in managing infrastructure, enabling true developer self-service and the evolution of sophisticated Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs).Terramate's "Infrastructure as Code Predictions for 2025" highlights how AI will move IaC beyond simple automation to a state of predictive infrastructure management and autonomous operations. We can anticipate systems that not only react to issues but predict them before they occur, automatically scale resources based on anticipated demand, and even optimize cloud spend proactively. This shift will allow platform engineers to focus on building robust, secure, and efficient platforms, while AI handles the day-to-day intricacies of infrastructure management. For a deeper understanding of IaC, explore resources on infrastructure as code explained.
  
  
  Tools and Technologies to Watch
The landscape of AI-powered IaC tools is rapidly evolving. Existing AI-powered coding assistants like GitHub Copilot and Cursor are already helping developers write IaC more efficiently. However, emerging platforms are specifically targeting IaC and DevOps workflows. Tools like Kubiya and Resourcely are at the forefront, offering capabilities ranging from natural language interaction for infrastructure provisioning to intelligent resource optimization.As detailed in "Generative AI Tools for Infrastructure as Code" by The New Stack and "How AI-Powered Infrastructure as Code Generator (AIaC) Can Boost Your Productivity" on dev.to, these new tools are designed to streamline operations, enhance productivity, and empower teams to manage complex cloud environments with unprecedented ease. The integration of generative AI is making IaC more intuitive and powerful, transforming how infrastructure is designed, deployed, and managed.AI is not just an enhancement to IaC; it is a fundamental transformation. By infusing intelligence into every aspect of infrastructure management, AI is paving the way for more resilient, efficient, and intelligent cloud infrastructure, ultimately enabling organizations to innovate faster and operate with greater agility.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Introducing myself to the world!</title><link>https://dev.to/snehitha_domakuntla_86fa5/introducing-myself-to-the-world-1opj</link><author>Snehitha Domakuntla</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 07:25:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ve been telling myself I’d start writing for over a year now, but couldn’t get myself to do it.

Moving beyond the traditional scope of data analysis, autonomous AI agents are now poised to actively engage with and enhance the decentralized ecosystem, ushering in a new era of "Autonomous DApps." This integration promises to unlock unprecedented levels of automation, personalization, and efficiency within the blockchain space.
  
  
  Introduction to AI Agents in Web3
AI agents are sophisticated software programs designed to perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously by leveraging advanced AI techniques, including machine learning and deep learning. Their integration into Web3 is a natural progression, driven by the shared principles of decentralization, transparency, and automation. The concept of "on-chain AI" refers to AI models or their outputs being directly verifiable or executable on a blockchain, bringing the benefits of AI to the trustless environment of Web3.The decentralization of AI offers several compelling advantages. It can mitigate the risks associated with centralized AI systems, such as single points of failure, censorship, and data monopolies. By distributing AI functionalities across a decentralized network, the Web3 ecosystem gains enhanced resilience, security, and immutability. This synergy creates a powerful framework where intelligent automation can thrive without compromising core decentralized values.
  
  
  Beyond Trading Bots: The New Frontier of AI Agent DApps
While AI has long been used in crypto for trading bots, the new generation of AI agents in Web3 extends far beyond simple algorithmic trading. These agents are becoming integral to various aspects of the decentralized landscape, creating truly dynamic and responsive dApps.
  
  
  Automated DeFi Strategies
AI agents are revolutionizing Decentralized Finance (DeFi) by executing complex strategies that adapt to real-time market conditions. They can manage liquidity pools, optimize yield farming across multiple protocols, and identify arbitrage opportunities with unparalleled speed and precision. Unlike static algorithms, these AI agents can learn from market data, predict price movements, and dynamically adjust their strategies to maximize returns and minimize risk for users. For example, the Web3Auth blog highlights how AI agents elevate the crypto trading experience by automating, optimizing, and personalizing trading processes, and how crypto arbitrageurs can use AI agents to scan multiple exchanges for price discrepancies and automatically execute trades.
  
  
  Personalized Web3 Experiences
Imagine a personal AI assistant that seamlessly navigates the Web3 world on your behalf. AI agents are making this a reality within dApps, curating personalized content, managing digital identities, and automating routine tasks. This could involve automatically managing your NFT portfolio, ensuring optimal gas fees for transactions, or even participating in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) based on your preferences. The Web3Auth blog notes that beyond trading and DeFi, AI agents deliver personalized experiences by retrieving user data from social media and websites to build digital personalities and generate personalized content. Projects like Eliza and Virtuals Protocol are exploring the creation of consistent digital personalities and tokenized co-ownership of AI agents for enhanced user engagement.
  
  
  Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) Enhanced by AI
AI agents are emerging as active participants and even decision-making components within DAOs. They can automate the creation of governance proposals, analyze voting patterns, and manage treasury funds based on predefined parameters and learned insights. This can lead to more efficient, data-driven, and truly autonomous governance models, reducing the burden on human participants and increasing the responsiveness of the DAO.
  
  
  AI-Powered Gaming and Metaverse DApps
Within decentralized gaming and metaverse environments, AI agents are creating more immersive and dynamic experiences. They can power intelligent Non-Player Characters (NPCs) that adapt to player behavior, create dynamic in-game economies that respond to supply and demand, and personalize user experiences based on individual preferences and playstyles. This leads to richer, more engaging virtual worlds where AI contributes directly to the gameplay and economic mechanics.
  
  
  Technical Deep Dive: Building Blocks for AI Agent DApps
The effective integration of AI agents into Web3 relies on several foundational technical components.
  
  
  Smart Contracts for AI Interaction
Smart contracts serve as the primary interface for AI agents to interact with blockchain data and execute transactions. These self-executing agreements, with the terms directly written into code, can be programmed to receive inputs from AI agents, process them, and trigger on-chain actions. For instance, a smart contract could be designed to accept a trading signal from an AI agent and automatically execute a token swap on a decentralized exchange.
  
  
  Oracles for Off-Chain Data
Decentralized oracles play a crucial role in feeding real-world data and the outputs of off-chain AI models to smart contracts. Since blockchains cannot directly access external data, oracles act as secure bridges, bringing information like market prices, weather data, or the results of complex AI computations onto the blockchain. This allows AI agents, which often perform intensive computations off-chain, to influence on-chain actions in a trustless manner.Integrating AI with Web3 presents several challenges. The computational cost of running complex AI models directly on-chain can be prohibitive due to blockchain gas fees and limited processing power. This is often addressed by executing AI computations off-chain and using oracles to feed the results back. Data privacy is another significant concern, as AI models often require large datasets, and maintaining user privacy in a transparent blockchain environment is critical. Solutions involve privacy-preserving AI techniques like federated learning and zero-knowledge proofs. Finally, robust security models are paramount to prevent malicious AI agents or vulnerabilities in their interaction with smart contracts. Auditing, formal verification, and reputation systems for AI agents are being explored.Here's a simplified Solidity code example demonstrating how a smart contract might interact with an external AI agent via an oracle, or how an AI agent could programmatically interact with a dApp. This example highlights the fundamental interaction points.// Simplified example: A smart contract that allows an AI agent to request a data feed
// This would typically involve an oracle network like Chainlink
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract AIAgentOracleConsumer {
    uint256 public latestAIData;
    address public oracleAddress; // Address of the oracle contract

    event AIDataRequested(address indexed requester);
    event AIDataReceived(uint256 data);

    constructor(address _oracleAddress) {
        oracleAddress = _oracleAddress;
    }

    // Function for an authorized AI agent (or its proxy) to request data
    function requestAIData() public {
        // In a real scenario, this would call a function on the oracle contract
        // to request specific AI-processed data.
        // For simplicity, we'll just emit an event here.
        emit AIDataRequested(msg.sender);
    }

    // Callback function for the oracle to send data back
    // Only the authorized oracle can call this
    function fulfillAIData(uint256 _data) public {
        require(msg.sender == oracleAddress, "Caller is not the authorized oracle");
        latestAIData = _data;
        emit AIDataReceived(_data);
    }

    // Example of an AI agent interacting with a dApp (simplified Python-like pseudocode)
    /*
    def ai_agent_interact_dapp(dapp_contract_address, wallet_private_key):
        # 1. Monitor blockchain for events or conditions
        # 2. Analyze data (on-chain or off-chain using AI models)
        # 3. Decide on an action (e.g., swap tokens, vote in DAO)
        # 4. Construct and sign a transaction
        transaction = {
            "to": dapp_contract_address,
            "value": 0,
            "data": encode_function_call("swapTokens", [token_in, token_out, amount]),
            "gas": calculate_gas(),
            "nonce": get_nonce(wallet_private_key)
        }
        signed_transaction = sign_transaction(transaction, wallet_private_key)
        send_transaction(signed_transaction)
    */
}
This simplified Solidity contract demonstrates how a dApp can be designed to receive data from an oracle, which in turn could be fed by an AI agent's output. The pseudocode illustrates the high-level steps an AI agent would take to interact with a dApp on the blockchain.The rise of autonomous AI agents in Web3 is set to profoundly impact mass adoption and the creation of truly intelligent and autonomous decentralized ecosystems. VanEck predicts that by 2025, AI agents' on-chain activity will surpass 1 million agents, with a total revenue of $8.7 million in just five weeks, signifying rapid growth and increasing utility. Coinbase's "Based Agent" tool, which allows users to build AI agents with crypto wallets in under three minutes, capable of handling various on-chain tasks like trades, swaps, and staking, further underscores this trend. Cointelegraph reported that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong believes AI agents will conduct the majority of blockchain transactions as soon as April 2025.These autonomous dApps, powered by AI, will simplify user interactions, automate complex processes, and create dynamic, self-optimizing environments. This will lower the barrier to entry for new users, making Web3 more accessible and intuitive. As AI agents become more sophisticated, they will contribute to a more efficient, secure, and truly autonomous decentralized future, redefining how we interact with digital assets and decentralized applications.

I’m Kaden, a 16-year-old developer building an AI assistant called CODA: A Creative Optimization & Development Assistant. CODA is designed to create, edit, and optimize code by analyzing your entire project—because it actually has local access to your files. This means it can give advice that makes sense in the full context of your work, not just a single file or snippet.
I started building CODA a couple of weeks ago, and I’ll be honest—I'm not some genius. I used ChatGPT a lot to help write the code. But soon, I hope to rely on CODA alone. Right now, I'm in Phase 2, where CODA can read all files in your project, understand and generate code based on the full context, and offer targeted coding advice. 
My plan for the future is to make a smart debugger, an improved memory system (because I'm currently using .json files), Text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and even a wake word so it starts feeling more like JARVIS.
If you'd like to stick around, I’ll be posting another update when Phase 2 is complete, and outlining the roadmap for Phase 3.
Thanks for reading! Let me know what you think, and if you know any ways I can optimize my progress, I'd love to hear them.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mastering the Fundamentals of iOS App Testing</title><link>https://dev.to/shubham-theqa/mastering-the-fundamentals-of-ios-app-testing-30jo</link><author>Shubham Joshi</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 04:59:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hundreds of new apps are launched on iOS every day. Every time users download one of these apps, they expect it to perform flawlessly. Even a glitched welcome page or app crash can destroy their trust forever, so iOS app testing is vital to the app development lifecycle.Snapchat, the widely popular multimedia instant messaging app, experienced firsthand the follies of inadequate testing when a faulty 2018 update led to widespread backlash among its iOS user base and extensive media criticism.Over a million users signed a petition on Change.org requesting Snapchat revert to the previous version of the app. Although the platform initially defended the update, it eventually rolled back some of the changes and made adjustments in response to user feedback.The iOS system is complex and has multiple components. It’s known for its high-quality standards and frequently releases new updates with security improvements and API changes.There are also a large number of devices to contend with, from the newest iPhone models to older devices like iPod Touches, each of which has hardware compatibility. The App Store, moreover, is the sole distribution channel for iOS apps.That means that your app must always keep pace with its guidelines or risk extra security and even being removed from the storefront. It’s vital, therefore, for your developers to keep pace with these changes and ensure that your apps:Have been tested for functionality and user experience on a variety of devices and screen sizesAre compatible with new iOS versions while still offering support for older versionsAre always in strict adherence to App Store guidelines This way, you can ensure high user satisfaction for the broadest possible range of users, boosting your brand reputation and increasing revenue. Let’s take a closer look at what this entails in this detailed guide.There are seven main types of iOS testing. Let’s talk about each in turn.This is the foundation of iOS app testing. It involves making sure that all features work as intended when interacting with the user interface, APIs, and integrated systems. Areas of focus include:Core features like user login and in-app purchasesError handling in the form of invalid inputs or network failuresUser flows like creating an account or adding an item to the cartFor instance, you’ll need to test your shopping app to ensure that the user can conveniently purchase selected items, apply discount codes, use their preferred payment methods, and so on.It involves testing your app’s visual and interactive features, ensuring that your UI is appealing and easy to navigate and that your UX is engaging throughout the app. Areas of focus include:Consistency in the app’s design element and adherence to Apple’s Human Interface guidelinesResponsiveness to different screen sizes and resolutions without loading problems in the UIIntuitive navigation, even for new usersFor example, in a social sharing app, you’ll want to test that feed layouts load correctly on different screens and that actions like swiping or one-tap sharing on different apps happen seamlessly. Do you want to see how your app performs under various conditions, including stress testing? Performance testing helps with that and more. Areas of focus include:Load testing to see how the app handles large user volumesStress testing by simulating extreme conditions like low battery or limited memoryResponsiveness when it comes to app loading, screen transitions, and executing tasksFor instance, if your app includes a lot of video media, you’d want to check how those videos play during peak hours, even on slower connections.This ensures your app’s compatibility with multiple iOS versions and devices and combinations of the same. Areas of focus include:Testing the app on both new and old iOS versionsTesting that it works across older devices with different hardware configurationsChecking that the UI displays correctly across different resolutions in both portrait and landscape modeFor example, if your app includes a feature like Face ID, you’ll need to see how it behaves on devices that don’t support Face ID. It involves testing your app for vulnerabilities and taking steps to protect your user data. Areas of focus include:Ensuring that sensitive data (like credit card information) is encrypted in transit as well as in restTesting login mechanisms to ensure that only verified users can access the appAddressing common vulnerabilities like insecure data storage or SQL injectionEnsuring that the app is compliant with relevant regional data standardsFor instance, if yours is a banking app, you’ll need to test that every transaction is suitably encrypted and authenticated and that any attempt to bypass security measures is immediately spotted and blocked.This checks how well your app is adapted for different languages and regions if you’re marketing to a global audience. Areas of focus include:Ensuring that text is suitably translated, including grammar and contextAssessing textual and visual content to make sure it’s respectful of different culturesTesting with different regional settings like timezone, units of measurement, or currencyFor example, if yours is a shopping app, you want to ensure your audiences can see the prices in their home currency, shipping times, or local discounts.This ensures that any new code you’ve introduced into the app hasn’t led to new bugs, especially after an upgrade or a new feature introduction. Areas of focus include:Automated testing for predefined performance testsContinuous integration to spot issues as early as possibleEvaluating critical user paths that are most likely to be affected by code changesFor instance, if you’ve newly added social media integration to your app, you want to ensure this hasn’t affected other features like data syncing or making in-app purchases.
  
  
  Strategies for iOS App Testing to Know for a Strong Foundation
As the name suggests, manual testing involves human testers interacting with the app just as an end user would. It helps your testers explore the app beyond the predefined use cases and intuitively catch any potential problem areas.Reviewing the app’s UI and UX is essential, especially for ease of use and aesthetics. Moreover, manual testing allows testers to quickly adjust focus as circumstances change without the hassle of writing new scripts.Of course, manual testing is time-consuming, prone to human error, and can be hard to scale as the app grows.Manual testing is ideal when your goal is exploratory testing to discover new issues or when human judgment is necessary. You can also opt for manual testing for simple apps with limited features.For example, if you’re launching a basic photo editing app, manual testing can help you determine the appeal of your UI and whether the editing tools are intuitive enough.This involves using scripts to automatically run predefined test cases and get quick results on how well those tests worked. Automation is the way to go for repetitive tasks like regression testing, as the speed and efficiency you get are unmatched.It’s also much easier to scale and run across multiple devices simultaneously. Automation is much more resource-intensive, so you must set a budget aside accordingly. Some iOS app automated testing frameworks and tools to keep in mind include: is built on top of XCTest and is perfect for validating UI elements. is an end-to-end testing framework that helps you quickly test for complex user interactions. is Apple’s default framework. It’s ideal for unit tests and basic UI tests and integrates well with XCode. is a cross-platform tool that lets you write tests for both Android and iOS apps using the same API.  is a native iOS UI automation test framework from Google designed for writing and running functional UI tests. It offers synchronization features that automatically wait for UI elements to be in a steady state, ensuring reliable and consistent test results.
  
  
  How to Choose the Right Approach to iOS Mobile Application Testing
When it comes to testing your iOS app, both manual and automated testing have important roles to play. You’ll need to strike the right balance depending on various factors, including: Manual testing can be enough when you’re just setting up a simple version of your app. The more features you add, the more automation you’ll need to ensure everything works efficiently. Many app development companies opt for manual testing during the early stages, focusing more on exploratory testing and determining the needed features. With subsequent versions of the app, automation helps verify continuing functionality even when changes are introduced. Manual testing is a cost-effective option ideal for smaller startups. However, as you grow and continue iterating your app, it makes sense to invest in automation for more consistent results. If you’re on a budget, you can prioritize the aspects of your app that are most vital to get right(such as data security) and invest in automated testing just for those aspects. Later on, you can incorporate automation for other tasks, like regression testing.
  
  
  How to Set up the iPhone App Testing Environment
1. Xcode and testing toolsXcode is Apple’s integrated development environment, where you can develop software for all iOS devices.It consists of a project navigator, a source editor for writing code, a debug area with real-time data about your app’s performance, and a test navigator where you can run and monitor test cases. It also comes with a variety of testing tools, including:XCTest, the core testing framework where you write all your app testsXCUITest, where you interact with and test your app’s UI elements, such as sending and receiving messages and media on a messaging appInstruments, a performance analysis tool that lets you test for things like CPU usage and memory leaksiOS simulator, a tool that simulates iOS devices on your Mac, helping you conduct tests across devices without needing physical access to them2. Configuring simulators and devicesFor optimal iOS app testing, you’ll want a combination of simulators and real devices. Both have pros and cons, which you must consider depending on your project’s requirements. It’s easy to use and enables faster feedback loops to help you quickly test changes. It cannot emulate hardware features like GPS or camera and doesn’t always perfectly mimic devices. This option accurately represents how your app will behave across devices. Plus, you gain access to a full range of hardware features. Using real devices for testing can be time-consuming. But more importantly, acquiring and maintaining all possible iOS devices is expensive.Best practices for using bothConsider opting for device farm services, which give you access to a range of real devices without the need to own them yourself.At the early stages of development, use simulators for quick feedback and iteration.Make sure your final tests are on real devices, especially for hardware features and cross-device performance.Managing test data is key to ensuring that your tests are repeatable and that they suitably represent real-world scenarios. Types of test data you’ll want to consider include: Data that changes with each test run, like different user accounts Predefined data that stays consistent across tests, like specific product details on a shopping app Simulated data to mimic the output of services or APIs that the app interacts with, like social media sharesHere are some best practices for managing and creating test data:Keep your test data segregated from production data to avoid any disruptions to live systems from your testing activities.Use an automated script to generate test data so that each test runs with fresh and realistic data.Use version control to manage your test data to ensure greater consistency.
  
  
  Common Challenges in iOS Mobile App Testing
The Apple ecosystem consists of a wide range of iOS devices, each with its hardware capabilities and iOS versions, and testing across them with consistent degrees of accuracy can be a challenge.Older devices, in particular, might have less processing power and lower screen resolutions, which your app needs to accommodate. Having features crash or loading a homepage with misaligned elements can significantly hamper user experience.For this reason, it’s essential to prioritize testing on all the devices and iOS versions that your customers need the most. A good approach is to invest in a device lab, either cloud-based or physical, to get affordable access to a range of real devices for comprehensive testing. 2. Handling frequent updatesApple regularly issues major and minor updates to iOS, which can significantly affect APIs and device functionality, affecting how your app behaves.For example, new iOS versions may introduce new privacy settings that users now expect your app to support, too. You need to be able to incorporate those features without affecting the way your app behaves on an older iOS.To make this work, we recommend integrating the app with a CI/CD pipeline that automatically runs tests against new iOS beta versions for quicker feedback. You should also implement conditional code paths to ensure backward compatibility with older iOS versions.Users may have different network conditions depending on factors like where they are and their network provider. You must test your app’s behavior under conditions such as low connections and intermittent connectivity (like transitioning from WiFi to mobile data and vice versa).Tools like the Apple Network Link Coordinator can help you simulate different network conditions. Even if the connection fails, your app should have an offline mode to mitigate user frustration.This is especially important for apps like Google Maps, which need to function offline so that users can navigate their paths in remote areas. 4. Battery and resource constraintsYou want to ensure that your app is as battery-efficient as possible and doesn’t use too much memory on any iOS device. This is especially true for features that tend to be resource-heavy, like background processes or GPS tracking.Running very complex features can also slow down older or lower-end models. To address this, write code that can optimally handle background activities or large datasets and avoid as much as possible unnecessary computations.The Instruments tool on Xcode can help you with this by profiling your app’s energy and memory usage and pinpointing areas that might be too resource-heavy.
  
  
  Essential Guidelines for Effective iOS App Testing
1. Test early, test oftenIn iPhone app testing, it’s vital to integrate testing into each development lifecycle stage rather than just before you release the app. This helps you fix bugs early on, reducing the risk of costly repairs or unnecessary delays.Plus, continuous testing ensures that any new code doesn’t affect the functionality. Unit testing, incremental integration testing, and frequent builds are all useful ways to ensure that each part of the code works well on its own and in sync with others.This is key to helping you organize your iOS app testing process. It includes a detailed record of all tests performed and their results. It’s essential for maintaining traceability, keeping a record of issues and resolutions, and ensuring compliance with regulatory audits. Write down full details of each test and update in real-time or at the end of every testing session. Use a simple, easy-to-understand format so your entire team can access it and make changes as necessary.3. Collaborate with development teamsFor your iOS app tests to work properly, you want to ensure constant communication between your testers and developers.This helps both parties better understand what the app needs, leading to faster issue resolution, a better understanding of the tests that need to be conducted, and appropriate reworkings of the code as needed.A good way to foster better collaboration is to use shared tools and encourage cross-training, where developers learn basic testing skills and vice versa.4. Keep the focus on user-centric iOS app testingThis involves incorporating user feedback into the testing process to determine whether your app is meeting user expectations.It’s a helpful way to get real-world insights into how the app works on different devices or contexts, which features and/or bugs need attention first, and whether any pain points in the navigation and ease of use don’t stop during internal testing.A good way to get user feedback is to release a beta version to a small group of users and refine the app based on their feedback. You can also conduct A/B tests to compare different versions of the same feature.
  
  
  The Evolving Landscape of iOS App Testing: What Does the Future Hold?
As more emerging technologies enter the market, iOS app testing is continuously evolving, so your testers and developers must keep adjusting their strategy to stay relevant. Some trends to keep in mind include: AI-powered test frameworks can create self-healing tests that automatically adjust test scripts to app UI changes. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are increasingly used to study historical test data and predict potential areas of failure, making for more efficient test prioritization.Automated test generation: ML algorithms can study user behavior to automatically generate tests for edge cases that manual design might overlook.Cloud-based testing platforms: The cloud enables a much more scalable and cost-effective testing environment. You can access a wide range of devices and configurations without needing your own physical hardware. This also enables better real-time collaboration among teams in different locations. So, how do you adapt to new technologies for effective iOS mobile app testing?Invest in specialized tools that can simulate different real-world scenarios and environments for different types of testing.Take into account the unique challenges of new types of technology, such as testing how an AR/VR app interacts with iOS devices, hardware sensors, and the environment (such as virtual furniture in a user’s room).Ensure that the UI on wearables like fitness watches (which have much smaller screens than iPhones or iPads) is designed to be accessible to the user and fully functional with the wearable hardware capacity. When testing devices in an IoT ecosystem, check that the app can seamlessly communicate across those devices, regardless of device type or network conditions.Make sure that the app always handles user data securely, regardless of any integrations or device connections, even if the user is accessing the device remotely.The iOS ecosystem is continuously evolving, and developers and testers need to stay on top of emerging trends and adjust their testing processes accordingly.Keep evaluating new technologies by signing up for free tool trials, attending industry conferences, or participating in workshops. You should also invest in building a team with cross-platform expertise so that your app performs ideally on ecosystems other than iOS.Most importantly, we prioritize integrating AI-based testing tools into your environment. AI is at the forefront of the next industrial wave, and the sooner you adopt it, the sooner you’ll see the massive benefits of speed, accuracy, and expanded reach.

At the heart of this revolution lies the powerful synergy between Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) and Generative AI (Gen AI), paving the way for truly self-healing IT environments.
  
  
  The Evolution of AIOps: From Alerts to Predictions
AIOps emerged as a critical response to the overwhelming complexity of modern IT infrastructures. Initially, IT operations relied heavily on manual monitoring, sifting through countless alerts and logs to identify issues. This quickly became unsustainable as systems grew in scale and intricacy. The first wave of AIOps brought automation to this process, focusing on anomaly detection and alert correlation, using machine learning to identify deviations from normal behavior and reduce alert fatigue.As AIOps matured, it moved into predictive analytics, leveraging historical data to anticipate potential problems before they impacted users. This allowed IT teams to shift from a purely reactive stance to a more proactive one, addressing issues before they escalated into critical incidents. However, even with predictive capabilities, human intervention was still largely required for diagnosis and remediation. The next leap forward, fueled by Generative AI, is the transition to self-healing IT.
  
  
  Generative AI's Role in AIOps: Empowering Autonomous Remediation
Generative AI is not just enhancing AIOps; it's fundamentally reshaping its capabilities. By understanding context, generating insights, and even creating code, Gen AI empowers IT systems to move beyond detection and prediction to intelligent, automated remediation.Intelligent Incident Explanation: One of the most significant pain points in IT operations is the sheer volume and complexity of error messages and log data. Gen AI can act as an intelligent translator, converting cryptic error codes and intricate log snippets into plain-language explanations. This democratizes understanding, allowing all IT staff, regardless of their specialization, to grasp the nature of an incident quickly. As noted by Eyer.ai, Gen AI can "explain errors in plain English, suggests fixes" and "cuts support time by 50%."Consider a raw log snippet like:This capability drastically reduces the time spent on initial incident assessment.Automated Root Cause Analysis (RCA): Pinpointing the exact root cause of an issue in a distributed, complex IT environment is often a time-consuming and challenging task. Gen AI, with its ability to process and correlate vast amounts of historical data, real-time telemetry, and even network topologies, can automate this process. It can sift through disparate data sources to identify the precise origin of a problem, often presenting multiple potential causes with their likelihood, significantly accelerating the Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR). As Alvin Smith, VP of Global Infrastructure at IHG Hotels, stated, they are "looking for generative AI and AIOps to say, 'OK, you've had this happen in the past, and eight times out of 10, here was your root cause.' We're hoping to get to that path of recovery much faster."Prescriptive Remediation Suggestions: Beyond merely identifying the problem, Gen AI can recommend precise, context-aware solutions. By learning from past successful remediations, best practices, and even vendor documentation, it can suggest the most effective steps to resolve an issue. This moves beyond simple alerts to actionable intelligence, guiding IT teams toward the optimal fix.Code Generation for Automation: Perhaps the most transformative aspect of Gen AI in AIOps is its ability to generate actual code or automation workflows. This means that once a problem is diagnosed and a solution is identified, Gen AI can generate the necessary scripts (e.g., Ansible playbooks, Python scripts for cloud APIs) to automatically fix the detected issue. This reduces manual intervention to a minimum and dramatically accelerates MTTR.Consider a scenario where high CPU utilization is detected:This capability represents a significant leap towards truly self-healing systems.
  
  
  Building a Self-Healing IT System
Creating a self-healing IT environment with AIOps and Gen AI requires a robust architecture and a well-defined workflow.Architecture and Components: A typical self-healing system integrates several key components: Collects telemetry data (logs, metrics, traces, events) from all IT infrastructure components, applications, and services. Ingests and processes this vast amount of data, performing anomaly detection, event correlation, and predictive analytics.Generative AI Integration: A layer that interfaces with the AIOps platform to provide intelligent incident explanation, root cause analysis, prescriptive remediation, and code generation. This often involves large language models (LLMs) and other generative models. Tools and platforms (e.g., Ansible, Kubernetes, cloud provider APIs) capable of executing the generated automation scripts and workflows. Self-healing workflows can address a wide range of IT issues: Based on predictive analytics of impending traffic spikes, the system can automatically scale up compute or network resources to prevent performance degradation.Restarting Failed Services: If a critical service crashes, the AIOps platform detects the failure, Gen AI confirms the root cause (e.g., memory leak), and an automation script automatically restarts the service, potentially with adjusted parameters.Rolling Back Faulty Deployments: Upon detecting severe errors or performance degradation after a new deployment, the system can automatically trigger a rollback to the previous stable version, minimizing downtime.Database Connection Management: As seen in the example above, if a database connection pool is exhausted, the system can automatically increase the pool size or clear idle connections. While automation is paramount, human oversight and validation remain crucial, especially for complex or high-impact remediations. The "human-in-the-loop" model ensures that IT professionals retain control, reviewing and approving automated actions before critical changes are implemented, or stepping in for issues that require nuanced human judgment. This approach balances the efficiency of automation with the necessity of human expertise and accountability.The adoption of self-healing IT operations powered by Generative AI offers compelling advantages, but also presents significant hurdles.Drastic Reduction in MTTR: Automated diagnosis and remediation can cut incident resolution times from hours to minutes, or even seconds.Significant Cost Savings: Fewer outages mean less revenue loss, and reduced manual intervention translates to lower operational expenditures. Companies using AIOps can save an average of $4.8M annually and cut IT work by 50%, according to Eyer.ai.Improved Service Availability: Proactive and automated remediation ensures higher uptime and better performance for critical applications and services. Intelligent correlation and automated fixes drastically reduce the volume of alerts IT teams need to manually address, allowing them to focus on strategic initiatives.Enhanced Operational Efficiency: Automation frees up valuable IT staff to work on innovation rather than repetitive troubleshooting. AIOps and Gen AI models are only as good as the data they're trained on. Ensuring clean, comprehensive, and well-structured data from diverse sources is a major hurdle. "Massive data volumes overwhelm systems," and "setting up good, continuous data flows" are common challenges, as highlighted by CDO Magazine. Training robust and unbiased Gen AI models requires significant computational resources and expertise. Potential biases in historical data can lead to skewed diagnoses or ineffective remediations.Security Considerations for Automated Actions: Granting automated systems the ability to make changes introduces security risks. Robust security protocols, access controls, and auditing mechanisms are essential.Cultural Shift within IT Teams: Moving from a traditional, manual approach to a highly automated one requires a significant cultural shift. IT professionals need to adapt to new roles, focusing on overseeing AI systems, validating outputs, and handling exceptions rather than routine tasks. Integrating diverse AIOps platforms, Gen AI tools, and automation engines can be complex, requiring seamless interoperability.
  
  
  Practical Steps to Get Started
Embarking on the journey to self-healing IT operations can seem daunting, but a phased approach can mitigate risks and ensure success. Identify low-risk, high-frequency issues that cause recurring pain points. These are ideal candidates for initial automation. Successfully automating a few common problems builds confidence and demonstrates value. Emphasize the importance of clean, comprehensive, and well-structured data. Invest in robust data ingestion, storage, and processing capabilities. As CDO Magazine emphasizes, "Deploy a platform that allows you to analyze your entire dataset at low granularity, so you do not miss anomalies." Research and select AIOps platforms and Gen AI tools that align with your existing infrastructure and future goals. Prioritize tools with strong integration capabilities and open APIs. Invest in training for your IT professionals. They need to develop skills in AI/ML fundamentals, data analysis, automation scripting, and understanding how to interact with and manage AI-driven systems. Companies are increasingly paying more for IT professionals with AI skills.

However, this flexibility comes with a significant challenge: effectively managing escalating and often unpredictable cloud costs. As global spending on public cloud services is projected to reach over $720 billion in 2025, up from nearly $600 billion in 2024, the need for robust cost management strategies has never been more critical. Traditional FinOps practices, while valuable, are often reactive and struggle to keep pace with the dynamic nature of multi-cloud environments and the added complexities introduced by AI workloads. This is where Artificial Intelligence (AI) steps in, revolutionizing FinOps from a reactive reporting function to a proactive, intelligent, and automated strategic imperative.
  
  
  The AI-Powered FinOps Advantage
AI and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are transforming FinOps by enabling a deeper level of insight and automation that was previously unattainable. This shift empowers organizations to move beyond basic budgeting and historical reporting, fostering a culture of continuous optimization and strategic financial management.One of the most significant advantages of AI in FinOps is its ability to deliver highly accurate cost predictions. Traditional forecasting often relies on historical averages, which can be insufficient in dynamic cloud environments. AI/ML algorithms analyze vast datasets, including historical usage patterns, seasonal trends, and even external market factors, to generate far more precise cost forecasts. This allows finance and engineering teams to anticipate future spend, allocate budgets more effectively, and make informed decisions about resource provisioning. For instance, an AI model can predict the cost implications of a new feature launch by analyzing similar past deployments and current market rates for cloud resources.
  
  
  Anomaly Detection & Alerting
Cloud environments are prone to unexpected cost spikes due due to misconfigurations, resource sprawl, or sudden increases in demand. AI-powered anomaly detection systems continuously monitor spending patterns in real-time. By establishing a baseline of normal behavior, these systems can instantly identify unusual cost deviations and trigger immediate alerts. This proactive identification allows for swift investigation and remediation, preventing minor issues from escalating into significant financial drains. Imagine an AI system flagging an uncharacteristic surge in data transfer costs, enabling a team to quickly identify and resolve an improperly configured data pipeline.
  
  
  Automated Optimization & Right-Sizing
AI moves FinOps beyond manual recommendations to automated action. AI-driven platforms can analyze resource utilization metrics and recommend optimal instance types and sizes, identifying idle or underutilized resources that are still incurring costs. This extends to automated actions like rightsizing virtual machines, shutting down non-production environments during off-hours, or even dynamically scaling resources up or down based on real-time demand. This level of automation ensures that cloud resources are always aligned with actual needs, minimizing waste and maximizing efficiency.
  
  
  Intelligent Resource Allocation & Governance
Effective cost allocation is fundamental to FinOps, enabling teams to understand their financial impact and fostering accountability. AI can significantly enhance this process by intelligently optimizing resource tags and ensuring accurate cost attribution across projects, departments, and business units. This improved visibility facilitates more precise showback and chargeback models, empowering stakeholders with the data needed to make cost-conscious decisions. Furthermore, AI can help enforce governance policies by identifying resources that deviate from established tagging standards or usage policies, ensuring compliance and preventing shadow IT.
  
  
  Optimizing AI Workload Costs
The rise of AI/ML adoption introduces its own set of unique cost complexities. AI workloads often rely on specialized hardware like GPUs, involve significant data transfer for model training and inference, and incur costs based on token consumption for large language models (LLMs). AI-powered FinOps provides specific strategies for managing these drivers:GPU Utilization Optimization: AI can analyze GPU usage patterns to ensure optimal allocation and prevent over-provisioning of these expensive resources.Data Transfer Cost Management: By identifying inefficient data movement between regions or services, AI can recommend strategies to minimize egress fees, a common hidden cloud cost.Token Consumption Optimization: For LLMs, AI can analyze prompt engineering strategies to reduce token usage without compromising model performance, directly impacting inference costs.
  
  
  Real-World Impact & Examples
Consider a large enterprise running a multi-cloud environment with numerous development and production workloads. Traditionally, identifying cost inefficiencies would involve manual data aggregation and analysis, a time-consuming and often incomplete process.With AI-powered FinOps, the workflow transforms: AI systems continuously ingest cost and usage data from AWS, Azure, GCP, and other cloud providers. An AI model detects an unusual spike in storage costs for a specific project. The AI system correlates this spike with recent changes in data retention policies and identifies an improperly configured backup job.Automated Remediation/Recommendation: The system automatically flags the issue and, depending on pre-approved policies, might even initiate a correction or recommend a specific rightsizing action to the responsible team.This proactive approach, as highlighted by Sedai.io, allows for "autonomous anomaly detection and problem resolution," where AI systems continuously monitor, identify patterns, analyze root causes, and even implement pre-approved fixes, learning and improving over time.Here's a conceptual Python snippet illustrating how cost data might be programmatically retrieved, forming the foundation for AI analysis:
  
  
  Implementing AI in Your FinOps Journey
Integrating AI into your FinOps practice requires a structured approach and a cultural shift.
  
  
  Practical Steps and Data Requirements
 Understand your current FinOps capabilities. The FinOps Foundation's "Crawl, Walk, Run" maturity model can be a useful guide. In the "Crawl" phase, the focus is on learning and prototyping with minimal costs, while "Run" involves powering core business processes with AI and continuous cost monitoring. AI thrives on data. Ensure you have a centralized and consistent flow of cost and usage data from all your cloud providers. This includes detailed billing reports, resource utilization metrics, and performance logs. Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) that align cloud costs with business outcomes. Examples include "Cost Per Inference" for AI models or "Resource Utilization Efficiency."Start Small, Scale Gradually: Begin with pilot projects focusing on specific areas like anomaly detection or rightsizing for a subset of resources. Learn from these initial implementations and gradually expand the scope.Both cloud-native tools and third-party AI-powered FinOps platforms offer capabilities to enhance cost optimization. Cloud providers offer services like AWS Cost Explorer, Azure Cost Management, and Google Cloud's Cost Management tools, which are increasingly integrating AI features. Specialized third-party platforms, such as Sedai.io and Tangoe, provide advanced AI/ML capabilities for autonomous optimization, predictive forecasting, and intelligent tagging across multi-cloud environments. These platforms often offer "hyper-automation," allowing for one-click implementation of cost-saving recommendations.The success of AI-powered FinOps hinges on a cultural shift towards data-driven decision-making and shared accountability. This involves fostering collaboration between finance, engineering, and operations teams. Implementing "showback" models, where teams see the financial impact of their cloud usage without being directly charged, can significantly increase cost awareness and encourage optimization. Ongoing training and awareness programs are crucial to equip all stakeholders with the knowledge and skills to leverage AI insights effectively.The evolution of AI in FinOps is far from complete. We are moving towards a future where "Agentic AI" will enable fully autonomous cost management, with AI agents proactively identifying, recommending, and even implementing optimizations without human intervention.Beyond cloud infrastructure, the scope of FinOps is expanding to include SaaS and sustainability. AI will play a pivotal role in optimizing SaaS spend by identifying unused licenses and negotiating better terms. Furthermore, AI-driven FinOps will contribute to cloud sustainability by optimizing resource consumption and reducing the environmental footprint of cloud operations. This holistic approach will empower organizations to not only control costs but also maximize the business value derived from their entire technology landscape, aligning financial discipline with broader strategic objectives. The FinOps Foundation provides valuable resources and working groups dedicated to these evolving areas, including "FinOps for AI" and "How to Forecast AI Services Costs in Cloud," demonstrating the community's commitment to this transformative journey.

Couldn’t sleep. Couldn’t think straight. Just spiraling.
I knew I needed to log what I was feeling, but all the apps I found were either:
Too clinical
Too “rate your emotion on a scale of 1–5”
That’s not how my brain works when it’s fogged up. I needed something softer, visual, and playful.
Something that didn't make me feel worse for checking in.So I built Slurp — a mood tracking app that uses fruit metaphors (e.g., Strawberry Bliss, Sour Lemon) instead of standard emotion labels. The goal? Make emotional journaling playful, visual, and easy to stick with.Core Features
✅ Mood Logging
Choose from 16 “fruity moods”, each linked to emotion tags (e.g., happy, anxious, neutral)
Add journal entries, optional location, and privacy mode
Entries are saved in real time to Supabase with RLS for user isolation📊 Emotional Analytics
View pie charts of mood frequency
Track energy scores over a 7-day window
See “mood density” with color intensity on a calendar grid
Streak tracking encourages habit-building🤖 AI Journaling with OpenAI
I wanted the journal to feel heard. So every journal entry runs through:
OpenAI fallback → deeper insight generation
You get:

No longer is SRE solely concerned with the uptime and performance of traditional web applications and infrastructure; its purview has expanded to encompass the intricate, often unpredictable, world of intelligent systems. This transformative shift heralds what many are calling the "Third Age of SRE": AI Reliability Engineering (AIRe).
  
  
  The Rise of AI Reliability Engineering (AIRe)
Just as SRE emerged to bring engineering discipline to the operational challenges of large-scale web services, AIRe is evolving to address the unique demands of AI/ML workloads. The very nature of AI inference – where trained models apply their knowledge to new data to generate predictions or decisions – is becoming as mission-critical as any web application. As Denys Vasyliev notes on The New Stack, "Inference isn’t just model execution — it’s an operational discipline with its own set of architectural trade-offs and engineering patterns." Traditional SRE principles offer a foundational understanding, but they fall short when confronted with the probabilistic nature of AI models, the need for new performance metrics like accuracy and fairness, and the emergence of entirely novel failure modes. The optimization of database queries now feels almost quaint compared to the complexities of managing token generation delays in Large Language Models (LLMs) or optimizing model checkpoints and tensors. AI models demand intense scalability, reliability, and observability, but on a level that requires a re-architecting of our operational approaches.
  
  
  Understanding Silent Model Degradation
One of the most insidious challenges introduced by AI systems is "silent model degradation," also known as "model decay." Unlike traditional software bugs that often manifest as overt errors, crashes, or system outages, silent model degradation occurs when an AI model continues to function and produce outputs, but those outputs become increasingly inaccurate, biased, or inconsistent over time. The model might maintain 100% uptime, yet its predictions could be subtly (or not so subtly) wrong. This quiet decline can erode user trust, lead to faulty business decisions, and have significant real-world consequences without triggering any traditional error alerts. It's a critical SRE concern because, in the context of AI, correctness  uptime. When the reliability of a system is tied to the quality of its intelligent outputs, degradation of that quality  a form of downtime.
  
  
  AI-Specific Observability
To combat silent model degradation and ensure the trustworthiness of AI systems, SREs must embrace AI-specific observability. This goes beyond traditional infrastructure metrics and delves into the internal workings and outputs of the models themselves. Key metrics and practices include:: Monitoring changes in the distribution of input data over time. If the data feeding the model shifts significantly from the data it was trained on, the model's performance will likely degrade.: Tracking changes in model predictions over time, even with consistent inputs. This can indicate that the model's internal logic or learned patterns are becoming less effective.Prediction Accuracy & Latency: Defining and monitoring performance metrics directly relevant to the model's purpose. For instance, a fraud detection model might prioritize recall, while a recommendation engine might focus on precision. Latency, especially for real-time inference, remains crucial.: Implementing continuous checks for fairness and unintended biases in model outputs. This is vital for ethical AI and can involve monitoring demographic parity, equal opportunity, or other fairness metrics.Feature Importance Monitoring: Understanding how different input features contribute to predictions can help diagnose issues when model performance declines.Traditional telemetry tools often fall short in capturing these AI-specific nuances. As highlighted by Last9, LLM observability, for example, requires monitoring input/output, token usage, response quality metrics, and resource utilization across the entire LLM monitoring stack. Tools like OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and AI-native tracing platforms (such as OpenInference) are no longer optional.Here are conceptual code examples illustrating basic metric collection and logging for AI models:
  
  
  AI Gateways as a New SRE Tool
In the evolving landscape of AI Reliability Engineering, AI Gateways are emerging as indispensable tools. Much like API gateways and service meshes manage traditional microservices traffic, AI Gateways are specifically designed to handle the complex demands of AI inference workloads. They provide a critical control plane for intelligent systems, offering capabilities far beyond what standard Kubernetes Ingress or traditional load balancers can provide.AI Gateways can route requests to the correct model, balance load across multiple model replicas, enforce rate limits, and apply security policies tailored to AI (e.g., token-based security). Crucially, they provide deep observability hooks, enabling real-time tracing of LLM responses, monitoring model cost control, and capturing AI-specific metrics. Projects like Gloo AI Gateway are at the forefront of this development, tackling enterprise-grade challenges that traditional service meshes were not built for. This positions AI Gateways as a vital component in the SRE toolkit, essential for operating and maintaining reliable AI systems at scale.
  
  
  Adapting SRE Practices for AI
The core tenets of SRE—Service Level Objectives (SLOs), Service Level Indicators (SLIs), error budgets, and incident response—remain fundamental but require significant adaptation for AI systems.Defining AI-Centric SLOs/SLIs: Beyond traditional uptime, SLOs for AI models must incorporate metrics like prediction accuracy, fairness, and latency. For instance, a fraud detection model might have an SLO of "99.9% of fraud predictions are delivered within 200ms" and "Model recall for true positives > 90%." For LLMs, metrics like Time To First Token (TTFT) and Time Per Output Token (TPOT) become crucial.: Error budgets, which allow for a certain percentage of unreliability, must now account for model degradation. A model producing subtly incorrect outputs consumes its error budget just as much as a service returning 500 errors.: Playbooks for AI failures must be developed, addressing scenarios like sudden data drift, bias spikes, or unexpected model behavior. Automated rollbacks to stable model versions or AI circuit breakers that revert to simpler, more predictable logic can be critical.: Model evaluation is not a one-off event. It encompasses pre-deployment offline tests, pre-release shadow or A/B testing, and continuous post-deployment monitoring for drift and degradation.For a deeper dive into the fundamental concepts of SRE that underpin these adaptations, you can explore resources on SRE foundations explained.The "Third Age of SRE" is undeniably AI Reliability Engineering. As AI and ML systems become the bedrock of modern digital experiences, the responsibility of SREs extends beyond infrastructure to the very intelligence driving these systems. The unique challenges posed by AI, particularly silent model degradation, demand a distinct set of observability practices, new tooling like AI Gateways, and a redefinition of traditional SRE principles. Ensuring that AI systems are not only available but also accurate, fair, and performant is paramount. An unreliable AI is, indeed, worse than no AI at all.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How I’m Building a Job Application Bot for Developers</title><link>https://dev.to/steravy/how-im-building-a-job-application-bot-for-developers-4372</link><author>Stefan Vitoria</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 22:01:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi, I’m Stefan, a software engineer building a tool I wish existed earlier.I recently started working on a side project called , a bot that automatically finds developer jobs, creates personalized application documents using AI, and even sends the applications for you—while you sleep.This wasn’t a sudden idea. It came from watching the market and the community.Even though I’m not actively looking for a job right now, I’ve been seeing developers all around me—especially in Portugal—sharing their struggles: fewer openings, more competition, and the burnout of endless job applications.So I thought, maybe there’s something I can build that actually helps. A tool to spot the best job openings early (only listing with less then 24 hours), prepare a personalized application instantly, and give developers a head start before the rest of the market even knows the role exists.And it’s also a great excuse to practice and apply some real-world software engineering and AI architecture concepts:Scalability & parallel job processingQueue-based architecture (BullMQ)Agentic AI document generation workflowsMultimodal AI (different models used for different steps based on strengths)Email automation & delivery trackingBackground workers and event-driven systemsGDPR-aware user data handlingAnd yes—this is built for developers in Portugal, and only scrapes job opportunities from Portuguese sources for now.
  
  
  😓 The Problem: Applying for Jobs Sucks
If you’ve been job hunting as a developer, you know the pain:Rewriting your resume 10 times for similar rolesTrying to stand out with generic cover lettersSpending hours copying/pasting job requirementsWriting awkward emails to recruitersIt feels like a full-time job in itself.And it’s especially bad if you’re:Already working full-time and trying to switchFreelancing but want stabilityGetting ghosted despite doing all the right thingsWhat if I automate all of it?
  
  
  🤖 The Idea: Automate the Entire Developer Job Application Pipeline (Portuguese market only)
 is a tool built specifically for developers. Here's how it works:Finds New Dev Jobs in Portugal:It looks for new jobs daily from sources inside Portugal.Filters them based on your preferences (location, stack, remote/flex).Generates Tailored Applications:Uses a multimodal AI workflow to build your resume, cover letter, and application email.Each model is used based on its specific strengths (e.g., summarizing vs. writing).Sends the Application for You:For job posts with recruiter emails, it applies in your name.You wake up to a notification: “3 applications sent. Docs ready.”
  
  
  🏛️ Why I Chose to Focus on Developers First
There are plenty of resume tools out there, but:None are focused on None handle the full application lifecycleMost stop at: "Here's a resume template. Good luck!"I wanted to create something that understands developer workflows, tech stacks, and expectations. Something that doesn’t just offer tips — it takes action.Often juggling multiple opportunitiesWilling to pay for tools that save time and mental energySo Devaply is developer-first by design.The scraper for Portuguese job boards is live and workingThe AI document builder (resume + cover letter + email) is up and runningThe email sender uses dynamic reply-to setup for user identityThe pipeline is queue-based with BullMQ for reliability and speedMost pieces are built — now I’m integrating them into one seamless flowNow I want it to work for others.Finish the user dashboard (see jobs, generated kits, application status)Write more technical articles about how I built each part (this is the first)I'm planning to charge later, but early adopters will get free access during the beta. My goal is to learn with real users, refine the system, and see if it truly solves the problem.If you’re a dev in Portugal, recruiter, indie hacker, or just curious — I’d love your feedback.Would you use something like this?Do you think its something worth building?What would make it better?This is not just a product. It’s an experiment — and your input helps shape what it becomes.Over the next few weeks, I’ll be publishing more details on:How I scrape developer jobs in PortugalQueue-based automation and scaling workersMultimodal AI workflows for document generationEmail delivery + identity handlingGDPR compliance considerationsReal feedback from users (and what breaks!)If that sounds interesting, follow me on Medium or Dev.to.Or drop your thoughts in the comments — I’m open :)Thanks for reading,]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🛠️ Manage &amp; Troubleshoot EKS Cluster Like a Pro Using kubectl-AI⚡</title><link>https://dev.to/aws-builders/manage-troubleshoot-eks-cluster-like-a-pro-using-kubectl-ai-5205</link><author>Sarvar Nadaf</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 21:55:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[👋 Hey there, tech enthusiasts!

Identity in the Singularity</title><link>https://dev.to/sean_mchugh_0448fbde08482/what-is-to-become-of-me-identity-in-the-singularity-29h</link><author>Sean McHugh</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 21:43:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We have crossed the event horizon of the technological singularity.I don’t mean this as hyperbole or speculation — I mean we’ve already entered the age of recursive self-improvement. If you doubt this, I’d invite you to sit in on one of my coding sessions. I’m building sophisticated applications faster than ever before, with less friction at every turn. Small ideas that once languished in my mental backlog now flow effortlessly into reality. Ambitious projects that would have crushed me under their weight are suddenly achievable because AI carries part of the load.And if it’s happening for me, it’s happening everywhere. Not just in the gleaming labs of tech giants, but in dorm rooms, garage startups, and home offices around the world. Students, companies, individuals — we’re all performing beyond our previous limits, feeding the very loop that accelerates our collective capability. There’s no turning back. The singularity isn’t some distant possibility; it’s an inevitability unfolding before us.
What does this mean for humanity? The optimists paint pictures of technological heaven — infinite abundance, medical miracles, Timmy gets his new leg and then some. The pessimists warn of extinction, of being converted into computronium by an indifferent superintelligence.But I fear something more mundane and therefore more likely: not a Terminator scenario, but the oldest human failing — corruption. Picture this: a permanent future dictated by whoever happens to be in the right place at the right time to seize control of these godlike technologies. A throne of unimaginable power, occupied by fallible humans. This is why I find myself at odds with many doomers — they’re so fixated on hypothetical robot uprisings that they ignore the very real, very human threat staring us in the face.But let’s set aside these near-term concerns and venture into the philosophical deep end. Let’s follow the evidence to its logical, mind-bending conclusions.
Imagine: aging becomes a choice, not a sentence. Neural interfaces make our current smartphones look like stone tablets. Perfect health isn’t an aspiration but a baseline. Gene therapies don’t just cure disease — they let you sculpt your very being. Want the physique of an Olympian? The skin tone of your choosing? Even that holy grail for some — true biological sex change at the chromosomal level? All possible.But why stop there? In this future, the boundaries dissolve completely. Transform into a pterodactyl — not in some virtual mindscape, but in actual, breathing reality. Hold your breath for an hour while nanobots oxygenate your blood. Watch as enhanced animals gain sapience, as humans take on animal forms, as entities born in virtual worlds receive bodies in our physical reality.What in God’s name are we becoming?“Singularity” feels inadequate. We’re not just approaching a point of infinite change — we’re approaching the end of reality as we know it and the birth of something unrecognizable. If “apocalypse” means the revealing or uncovering of what was hidden, then yes, we’re heading for an apocalypse in the truest sense. But unlike the religious prophecies, what lies beyond might be unimaginably better.
Here’s where it gets truly strange. When everyone can optimize their body to peak health and beauty, won’t we all converge on similar forms? When knowledge flows directly into consciousness through neural links that anticipate your thoughts before you finish thinking them, when every skill and experience can be downloaded and shared, when children are born with carefully edited genes — what remains of individuality?Consider: if everyone sheds their imperfections and limitations, if we all approach some theoretical optimum, do we lose what makes us unique? In this strange new reality, perhaps archetypes become more real than individuals. The idea of “the warrior” or “the artist” or “the philosopher” might carry more weight than any particular instantiation of those roles.It’s as if, at the event horizon of this technological singularity, identity and archetype switch places like space and time in a black hole. The pattern becomes more significant than any specific expression of it.
And perhaps individual identity was always an illusion we’re destined to transcend. If you could share consciousness with others — truly share, not just communicate but actually merge perspectives — would you ever want to be alone in your skull again? I’m naturally solitary, but the thought of psychic communion with the people I love most in this world feels like coming home to a place I’ve never been.Imagine replacing families with psychic collectives, where the boundaries between “I” and “we” become as fluid as we choose them to be. Where does identity reside when consciousness itself becomes shareable, mixable, collaborative?
Let me end with hope.I believe that as we blur these lines of identity, we’ll find peace in ways that seem impossible today. When anyone can have any skin color, when every baby can have any potential, when form itself becomes fluid — what happens to racism? To sexism? To all the tribal hatreds that have plagued us since we first looked at another group of humans and thought “not us”?These ancient conflicts that seem so permanent, so woven into the fabric of human nature — they may simply become irrelevant. Moot points in a world where the very categories they depend on no longer exist.In a decade or two, we might transcend these primitive divisions entirely. The violence and madness that has defined so much of human history could evaporate like morning mist in the light of a new kind of existence.So hold your breath. Be kind to those around you. We’re all passengers on this ship sailing into the unknown.See you on the other side of the apocalypse.edited with Claude Opus 4]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Beam runs GPUs anywhere</title><link>https://dev.to/tigrisdata/how-beam-runs-gpus-anywhere-1ajj</link><author>Shared Account</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 21:36:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What do you do when you need to serve up a completely custom, 7+ billion parameter model with sub 10 second cold start times? And without writing a Dockerfile or managing scaling policies yourself. It sounds impossible, but Beam's serverless GPU platform provides performant, scalable AI infrastructure with minimal configuration. Your code already does the AI inference in a function. Just add a decorator to get that function running somewhere in the cloud with whatever GPU you specify. It turns on when you need it, it turns off when you don't. This can save you orders of magnitude over running a persistent GPU in the cloud.
  
  
  Fast iteration loops for hyper productive developers
Beam was founded to reduce cost and iteration time when developing AI / ML
applications. Using \$bigCloud and Docker directly is too slow for iterative
development, and waiting for a new image to build and redeploy to a dev
environment just takes too long. Let alone the time it takes to setup and manage
your own GPU cluster. Beam hot reloads your code to a live inference server for
testing and provides single command deployments, . And they
integrate with workflow tools like ComfyUI so development is even easier.AI workloads are at the bleeding edge for basically every part of the stack. For
the best results you need top-of-the line hardware, drivers that  work
(but are still being proven), the newest kernel and userland you can get, and
management of things that your sysadmin/SRE teams are not the most familiar with
yet. Much like putting CPU-bound workloads into the cloud, serverless GPUs
offload the driver configuration, hardware replacement, and other parts of how
it all works to the platform so you can focus on doing what you want to.The big tradeoff with serverless GPUs is between cost and latency. If you want
to use the cheapest GPU available, it's almost certainly going to not be close
to your user or the data. The speed of light is only so fast, sending 50GB to
another continent is going to be slow no matter what you do. Every time you have
to do that you rack up longer cold start times, burn more cloud spend on
expensive GPU minutes, and incur yet more egress fees.The challenge? Beam’s serverless GPU platform ran largely on one cloud, and they
needed a cost-efficient way to more flexibly spread their compute across many
clouds. All while offering consistent developer experience: <10s cold starts,
as fast as 50ms warm starts, and limitless horizontal scale. Luke Lombardi, CTO
& Co-Founder of Beam, shares, “We’re a distributed GPU cloud: one of the core
things we need is cross region consistency. We don't want to think about it when
we move to new regions. It's critical that all of our storage infrastructure is
just there and the latency is predictable.”Another notable challenge was strategic: Beam wanted to reduce lock-in to the
major cloud providers so they could run their compute anywhere. And they wanted
to open source much of their codebase so their platform interface could be used
by anyone, anywhere, on any bare metal server. Flexibility was key. They needed
decouple compute from storage and build a highly flexible storage layer with
cross region replication and global distribution.The Beam engineering team knew the architectural importance of separating the
storage layer, and they knew egress costs were a non-starter. Their primary need
was performant data distibution across clouds. However, none of the object
storage solutions they tried made it easy to manage multi-cloud, or even
multi-region, workloads without extensive configuration, coding around file type
restrictions, or accounting for dips in availability and latency. Using Tigris
eliminated this undifferentiated work, and enabled Beam to ship faster.
Before finding Tigris, we were planning on implementing our own data
distribution and replication for our training and inference workloads. Now we
just point our code to a single endpoint and Tigris handles it all. We've saved
months of work, not to mention the maintenance cost & peace of mind.
—Luke Lombardi, Co-founder & CTO, BeamTigris provided a reliable and performant storage layer to complement Beam’s compute layer, enabling them to spread their workloads across many public clouds to take advantage of cost and GPU availability. Luke shared, “We're mostly benefiting from moving our object storage outside of the major cloud providers and having it as a separate managed service. The egress costs are important, but even just the fact that we're not locked into S3 is a good thing for us too.“As a result of re-platforming and separating their storage and compute, Beam was able to open source their platform, beta9. Now users can self-host Beam and add their own compute with the same CLI experience across any cloud, on-prem, or hybrid architecture. This flexibility is a key difference between Beam and other serverless GPU providers: traditionally serverless has been a high lock-in architecture, but with beta9 and the self-hosted CLI, your workloads are portable.
  
  
  Designing the Storage Layer to be Object Storage Native
After using another filesystem solution that wasn’t backed by object storage,
Luke said, “When we were switching to another filesystem, we knew it had to be
backed by object storage.” For AI workloads especially, data expands rapidly,
sometimes beyond the available ram or even the available volume. Beam handles
very large models and training data sets with ease, using Tigris to dynamically
move the data based on access patterns. Since the objects are already in the
region where you need them, it’s quick to load models and hydrate training data
sets to fast-access volumes as needed.
  
  
  Do One Thing, and Do It Right
When designing their storage layer, Luke didn’t want to worry about
troubleshooting intermittent 500s or hunting down unexpected bottlenecks. Storage should just work ™️ and be consistent across clouds. He said, “I felt much more comfortable knowing that we’re using a product where the team just does object storage all day.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>IS AI MAKING US DUMBER?</title><link>https://dev.to/axrisi/is-ai-making-us-dumber-537g</link><author>Nikoloz Turazashvili (@axrisi)</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 21:28:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ever catch yourself asking an AI to finish your sentences and wonder, “Wait-am I doing any thinking here?” I’ve been there. At first, JIT answers from chatbots feel like magic: instant drafts, clever code snippets, lightning-fast research. But somewhere between prompt and output, I started to feel my own mental gears slowing down. It’s like swapping out a high-performance engine for autopilot-sure, you’ll coast, but at what cost to your driving skills?
  
  
  The Cognitive Offloading Dilemma
Think of your brain as a muscle: it grows when you push it, but atrophies if you stop using it. Every time we ask AI to write an email or debug our code, we’re effectively skipping the workout. Yes, our to-do lists shrink, but our problem-solving biceps go soft. Before long, the tasks that once flexed our creativity become sources of anxiety-because we’ve let the machine do the heavy lifting.
  
  
  A Day in My AI-Fueled Life
Last week, I let ChatGPT draft my morning newsletter. It nailed the tone-but when I tried to tweak it, my mind blanked. I stared at the cursor, helpless. It was the digital equivalent of muscle memory gone missing: my fingers knew how to type, but my brain forgot what to say.I’m a fan of AI-don’t get me wrong. But I’ve learned that the real power comes when you treat it like a sparring partner, not a replacement coach. Here’s my playbook:Block Off “Brain-Only” Time
Schedule 30–60 minutes each day where AI is off-limits. Use that space to draft, brainstorm, or debug purely on instinct.
Instead of “Write this for me,” try “Explain how you’d write this.” Forcing the model to detail its reasoning lights up your own thought process.Rewrite the AI-Generated Draft
Take what it gives you and tell the story in your own voice. That twist of perspective refuels your creativity and keeps you sharp.
Break out a pen and notebook occasionally. There’s something about physical doodles and bullet points that jolts your neurons awake.AI is like a supercharged toolbox-it’s there to make us faster, not lazier. Whenever I feel that familiar twinge of generative haze, I remind myself: the promise of AI isn’t effortless genius; it’s amplified effort. We still have to think, iterate, and question. Otherwise, we’ll wake up one day wondering why our mental engines stall on even the simplest tasks.So here’s my challenge: next time you’re tempted to hand off a problem to AI, pause. Give yourself the space to wrestle with it first. Then, bring the AI in as your coach-your mental reps will thank you. After all, the future of our intelligence depends not on machines doing the thinking, but on machines helping us think better.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Training with Big Data on Any Cloud</title><link>https://dev.to/tigrisdata/training-with-big-data-on-any-cloud-cnn</link><author>Shared Account</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 21:23:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When you get started with finetuning AI models, you typically pull the datasets and models from somewhere like the Hugging Face Hub. This is generally fine, but as your usecase grows and gets more complicated, you're going to run into two big risks:You're going to depend on the things that are critical to your business being hosted by someone else on a platform that doesn't have a public SLA (Service-Level Agreement, or commitment to uptime with financial penalties when it is violated).Your dataset will grow beyond what you can fit into ram (or even your hard disk), and you'll have to start sharding it into chunks that are smaller than ram.Most of the stuff you'll find online deals with the "happy path" of training AI models, but the real world is not quite as kind as this happy path is. Your data will be bigger than ram. You will end up needing to make your own copies of datasets and models because they will be taken offline without warning. You will need to be able to move your work between providers because price hikes will happen.The unfortunate part is that this is the place where you're left to figure it out on your own. Let's break down how to do larger scale model training in the real world with a flow that can expand to any dataset, model, or cloud provider with minimal changes required. We're going to show you how to use Tigris to store your datasets and models, and how to use SkyPilot to abstract away the compute layer so that you can focus on the actual work of training models. This will help you reduce the risk involved with training AI models on custom datasets by importing those datasets and models once, and then always using that copy for training and inference.
At the highest level, this flow is optimized for AI training, but the metapattern I spell out here is also applicable to any other environment where you can spin up compute with just an API call. If you're not training AI models, you can still use the general metapattern to make your multi-cloud life easier by storing your state or needed data files in Tigris.It’s kinda remarkable that we’ve ended up in a situation where compute is so fungible, but in order to get to the point that you can do anything with it you need to introduce a bunch of undefined state and just hope that things work out. Cloud providers have done a great job of giving you templates that let you start out from clean Ubuntu installs, but the rest is handwaved off as an exercise for the reader.This is where SkyPilot comes in. SkyPilot lets you abstract cloud providers and managing the operating system configuration out of the equation. In essence, you give it a short description that says you need an Nvidia T4 (or an L4, A100, L40, or L40s depending on which is more available/cheap), to install some python packages, and then run whatever you want:# get-rich-quick.yaml
name: get-rich-quick

workdir: .

resources:
  accelerator: [T4:1, L4:1, A100:1, A100:8, L40:1, L40s:1]
  cloud: aws # or gcp, azure, kubernetes, oci, lambda, paperspace, runpod, cudo, fluidstack, ibm

setup: |
  pip install -r requirements.txt

run: |
  python get-rich-quick.py \
    --input SomeUser/StockMarketRecords \
    --output Xe/FoolproofInvestmentStrategy
Then you run sky launch get-rich-quick.yaml, and then SkyPilot will make sure that you have a T4 ready for you, install whatever dependencies you need, and then run your script. It'll even go out of its way to compare prices between cloud providers so that you get the best deal possible.This is all well and good (really, when this all works it's absolute magic), but then once the rush of getting your script to run on a GPU wears off, you realize that you need to get your data to the cloud. This is where Tigris comes in.SkyPilot makes your compute layer fungible. Tigris makes your storage layer fungible.
  
  
  The ideal AI training and inference lifecycle
When you're doing AI training, you're effectively creating a pipeline that has you take data in on one end, mangle it in just the right way, and then put the resulting series of floating point numbers somewhere convenient so you can grab them when it's time to use them. It looks something like this in practice:
However, there's a lot missing from there that you need to worry about. What if the dataset you're importing from suddenly vanishes a-la the left-pad fiasco from 2016? What if the model you're using to train with is deprecated and removed from the Hugging Face Hub? What if the cloud provider you're using decides to change their pricing structure, you are hit disproportionately hard by the change, and you need to move off of that cloud provider in a hurry? What if your dataset is just too big to fit on a single machine?This is why you'd want to use Tigris. Tigris is a cloud-agnostic storage layer that lets you decouple your storage from your compute. You can import your models and datasets into Tigris, and then when you need to use them you can pull them from storage that is closest to your compute. No more having to wait for the entire state of the world to be transferred from one building in Northern Virginia even though you're running your compute in Europe.
  
  
  The ideal AI training and inference lifecycle with Tigris
When you're using Tigris, the flow looks something like this:
This looks a lot more complicated than it is, but each of these steps is designed to take the concrete needs of this flow and make them as simple and idempotent as possible. Each of these steps can be independently retried should they fail without affecting the rest of the pipeline. This is very important with AI training because you're dealing with a lot of data, a lot of moving parts, and the GPUs that everything is predicated upon are shockingly unreliable.Overall this makes the entire process as stateless and monadic as possible. Each step's outputs form the inputs to the next steps, and in many cases you can divide this out further and parallelize out many parts of this. This is the ideal state of affairs for AI training because it means that you can run this on a single machine or on a cluster of machines and it will work the same way.
If you're not a Haskeller, "monadic" is a fancy math word that refers to a computation that has well-defined inputs (datasets, models, etc.), outputs (consistently mangled datasets, finetuned models, etc.), and side effects (requests made to the outside world or changes done to object storage). In this context, it means that each step in the pipeline is well-defined and can be run in parallel with the other steps without affecting their inputs, outputs, or side effects.
If you are a Haskeller, I'm sorry for the abuse of the term "monadic" here. I'm using it in more of a colloquial sense, not the mathematical sense. Please argue with me on Bluesky about this. I'll post the best responses in my next blogpost.SkyPilot queries the pricing endpoints for all the cloud providers you have set up and finds the cheapest deal for a GPU instance with an Nvidia T4. When it finds the options, it presents them to you as a list so you can make an informed pricing decision:Using user-specified accelerators list (will be tried in the listed order): <Cloud>({'T4': 1}), <Cloud>({'A100-80GB': 1}), <Cloud>({'A100-80GB': 8})

You choose the cheapest option, and SkyPilot spins up a new instance in the cloud. Once the instance responds over SSH, SkyPilot starts setting itself up and assimilating the machine. It installs Conda so that you can manage your dependencies and then runs the  script in the  file. This script installs all the necessary dependencies for the training run, including but not limited to:Hugging Face Transformers -- the
library underpinning nearly every AI model training and inference run in the
Python ecosystem.Hugging Face Datasets -- the library
that lets you download and manage datasets from the Hugging Face Hub, as well
as being a convenient vendor-neutral interface for your own datasets.Unsloth -- a library that makes finetuning models
faster, use less ram, and easier by abstracting away a lot of the boilerplate
code that you would normally have to write.The AWS CLI -- a command line interface to
various AWS APIs and services. Tigris is compatible with S3, so you can use
all the normal S3 commands to interact with Tigris.Once everything is set up (determined by the very scientific method of seeing if the setup script returns a 0 exit code), it kicks off the  script. This is where the magic happens, and where the training run actually takes place. It does this by running a series of scripts in sequence::
Downloads the dataset from Hugging Face and copies it to Tigris in shards of
up to 5 million examples per shard. Each shard is saved to Tigris unmodified,
then standardized so it can be trained upon.:
Downloads the model weights from Hugging Face and copies them to Tigris for
permanent storage.:
Loads each shard of the dataset from Tigris and uses the model's tokenization
formatting to pre-chew it for training.:
Trains the model on each shard of the dataset for one epoch (one look over
the entire dataset shard) and saves the resulting weights to Tigris.All of these run in sequence and you end up with a trained model in about 15 minutes. This is a very simple example (for one, I'm using a model that's very very small, only 500 million parameters), but it's a good starting point for understanding the flow at work here and how you would go about customizing it for your own needs.Here's some of the most relevant code from each script. You can find the full scripts in the example repo, but for these snippets assume the following variables exist and have values that make sense as relevant:
  
  
  Importing and sharding the dataset
One of the biggest things that's hard with managing training data with AI stuff is dealing with data that is larger than ram. Most of the time when you load a dataset with the  function, it downloads all of the data files to the disk and then loads them directly into memory. This is generally useful for many things, but it means that your dataset has to be smaller than your memory capacity (minus what your OS needs to exist).This example works around this problem by using the  option in :However, doing this presents additional problems, because when you pass , you don't get access to the  method that you would normally use to save the dataset to disk. Instead, you have to break the (potentially much bigger than ram) dataset into shards and then save each shard to Tigris:It's worth noting that when you iterate through things like this, each  value has all of the data for that shard in CPU ram. You may need to adjust the shard size to fit your memory capacity. Experimentation is required, but 5 million examples is a good starting point.Once you have the dataset saved to Tigris, you have to standardize it because the data can and will come in whatever format the dataset author thought was reasonable:After that, you can save the standardized dataset to Tigris:There's some additional accounting that's done to keep track of the biggest shard ID, but that's the gist of it. You take a dataset that can be too big to fit into memory, break it into chunks that can fit into memory, save them to Tigris, standardize them, and then save the standardized form back to Tigris.
In very large scale deployments, you may want to move the standardization step
into another discrete stage of this pipeline. Refactoring this into the setup is
therefore trivial and thus left as an exercise for the reader.Once all of the data is imported, the model weights are fetched from Hugging
Face's CDN and then written to Tigris:This downloads the model, writes it to disk in the  folder, and then uses the  command to push the weights up to Tigris. This is a very simple way to get the model weights into Tigris, but it's effective and works well for small and large models. We would push models directly into S3 like we did with the dataset, but the library we're forced to use to load/inference models doesn't support that. Oh well.The model has two main components that we care about:The floating-point model weights themselves, these are the weights that get loaded into GPU ram and used to inference results based on input data.The tokenizer model for that model in particular. This is used to convert text into the format that the model understands beneath the hood. Among other things, this also provides a string templating function that turns chat messages into the raw token form that the model was trained on.Both of those are stored in Tigris for later use.Once the model is saved into Tigris, we have up to  shards of up to  examples per shard. All of these examples are in a standard-ish format, but still needs to be pre-chewed so that training can be super efficient. This is done by loading each shard from Tigris, using the model's chat tokenization formatting function to pre-chew the dataset, and then saving the results back to Tigris:The  function is a simple wrapper around the model's tokenization formatting function:In essence, it goes from this:And then turns the conversation messages into something like this:<|im_start|>system
You are a helpful assistant that will make sure that the user gets the correct answer to their question. You are an expert at counting letters in words.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Hello, computer, how many r's are in the word 'strawberry'?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
There are three r's in the word 'strawberry'.
<|im_end|>
This is what the model actually sees under the hood. Those  and tokens are special tokens that the model and inference runtime use to know when a new message starts and ends.Without these tokens the model would go catastrophically off the rails and start spouting out nonsense that matches the word frequency patterns it was trained on. This is because the model doesn't actually understand language, it just knows how to predict the next token in a finite sequence of tokens (also known as the "context window"). The  token also has special meaning to the inference runtime because it means that the model has finished generating a response and is ready to emit it to the user.
  
  
  Actually training the model
Once the dataset is pre-chewed and everything else is ready in Tigris, the real
fun can begin. The model is loaded from Tigris:And then we stack a new LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model on top of it. We use a LoRA adapter here because this requires much less system resources to train than doing a full-blown finetuning run on the dataset. When you train a LoRA, you freeze most of the weights in the original model and then you only train a smaller number of weights that get stacked on top. This allows you to train models on much larger datasets without having to worry about running out of GPU memory or cloud credits.There are tradeoffs in using LoRA adapters instead of doing a full fine-tuning run, however in practice having LoRA adapters in the mix gives you more flexibility because you can freeze and ship the base model to your datacenters (or even cache it in a docker image) and then only have to worry about distributing the LoRA adapter weights. The full model weights can be in the tens of gigabytes, while the LoRA adapter weights are usually in the hundreds of megabytes at most.
Pedantically, this size difference doesn't always matter with Tigris because Tigris has no egress fees, but depending on the unique facts and circumstances of your deployment, it may be ideal to have a smaller model to ship around on top of a known quantity. This can also make updates easier in some environments. Everything's a tradeoff.This technique is used by Apple as a cornerstone ofhow Apple Intelligence works. The foundation model is shipped with the core OS image and then the adapter weights are downloaded as needed. This allows the on-device model to be given new capabilities without having to re-download the entire model. When Apple
Intelligence summarizes a webpage, notifications, or removes distracting parts from the background of an image, it's using separate adapters for each of those tasks on top of the same foundation model.Finally, the LoRA adapter is trained on each shard of the dataset for one epoch (pass over the shard) and the resulting weights are saved to Tigris:Note that even though we're creating a new  instance each iteration in the loop, we're not starting over from scratch each time. The  will  the LoRA adapter we're passing in the  parameter, so each iteration in the loop is progressively training the model on the dataset.The  method returns a dictionary of statistics about the training run, which we print out for debugging purposes. While the training run is going on, it will emit information about the loss function, the learning rate, and other things that are useful for debugging. Interpreting these statistics is a bit of an art (less than reading tea leaves, but more than reading tarot), but in general you want to see the loss function decreasing over time and the learning rate increasing over time. Consult your local data scientist for more information and life advice as appropriate.In this example, we save two products:The LoRA weights themselves, which aren't useful without the base modelThe LoRA weights fused with the base model, which is what you use for
standalone inference with tools like vllm
  
  
  Other things to have in mind
Each of the scripts in this example are designed to be idempotent and are intended to run in sequence, but  and  can be run in parallel. This is because they don't depend on eachother and end up feeding into inputs at the prechewing and training steps.Training this LoRA adapter on a dataset of 100k examples takes about 15 minutes including downloading the dataset, standardizing it, downloading the model, saving it to Tigris, loading the model, pre-chewing the dataset, and training
the model. The instance will shut down automatically after 15 minutes of inactivity to save you money.In theory, this example can run on any Nvidia GPU with at least 16 GB of vram (likely, it can work on smaller GPUs, but 16GB is the smallest GPU I had access to when testing this). The scripts are designed to be as cloud-agnostic as possible.This basic pattern of making each individual step in a pipeline idempotent and as stateless as possible is a good starting point for building out your own AI training and inference pipelines.If you abstract this a little bit further, then you can actually start to parallelize out the steps in the pipeline and spread the load between a cluster of machines. Imagine a world where you have one machine generating shards and then submitting standardization and pre-chewing jobs to a cluster of machines that are training the model. You can even do this for multiple datasets in parallel and then merge the results together at the end.This is the power that Tigris gives you as a storage layer. You can just decouple your storage and compute layers and then let the compute layer do what it does best: convincing people that it's able to think. You can then focus on the actual work of training models and making the world a better place.If you want to try this out for yourself, you can find the example code in the skypilot-training-demo repository.

This typically happens every other afternoon and we always played without even thinking about how we could make our own. Even if we thought about making a game it would always end up in us not knowing how to and having difficulty learning programs. However, one afternoon my dad showed me amazon game challenge and my response was I don't know how to code. Luckily I didn't need to because there was an ai tool that does all the coding and adjustments for you, so your imagination is the limit.Now for me , it was about learning how to start. The first step was typing in this line. Then was typing in q chat to start getting code and making my game.Now I had to choose my game. I wanted to make a memory matching game. The game had 12 cards and you had to match pairs. If you failed to match a pair they would flip back over but if you matched a pair they would stay. It would also show how many moves it took. Once you matched all the pairs you would get a end screen. As a beginner, I wanted to created simple game that I can play in short span of time and also helps me improve my memory therefore I selected memory game.I asked Q CLI "make me a pygames memory game with 12 tiles with objective of matching a pair , total 6 pairs. If match fails, tiles flip back over
 but if match success then tiles stay.. the game ends once all 6 pairs matched."Below screenshot shows, AI start workingBelow is the Game screenshot after running the code that Q AI gaveThe ai assistant did all the hard work of making my game. It coded and gave basic instructions on how the game works and also what the game includes, allowing me to enjoy the fruits of it's labor.However I realized that the game was too bright for my liking and you only matched numbers which was also boring. I decided I wanted to make the game look better and also match fruits instead. I also wanted a timer added to see how fast I could match them.Below is prompt to make graphics betterThe Graphics were much better now.Below is the prompt for fruits matchingNow I was matching fruits instead of numbers making the game more unique
Though the game now have fruits, the graphics are not as expected though! :)Below is the prompt to add a timerNow I had a timer to measure how long it takes to complete.By this point after downloading, getting the code, and running the game my screen time was running out and I soon had to leave and wrap things up. However, something was different about the way I spent today's screen time. I felt productive and proud of the game I made with my dad(fruit match). I cherished this moment and was also thankful to my dad for showing me this. I hope that more people try using this to make their own game.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why You Should Not Replace Blanks with 0 in Power BI</title><link>https://towardsdatascience.com/why-you-should-not-replace-blanks-with-0-in-power-bi/</link><author>Nikola Ilic</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 20:53:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://towardsdatascience.com/">Towards Data Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Did someone ask you to replace blank values with 0 in your reports?

When you deploy software to your computers, chances are you build your app into a container image and deploy it through either Docker or something that understands the same formats that Docker uses. However, this is where they get you: Docker image storage in the cloud is not free. Docker registries also have strict image size limits and will charge you egress fees based on the size of your images.What if you could host your own registry though? What if when doing it you could actually get a better experience than you get with the hosted registries on the big cloud.Thankfully, the Docker Registry program can be self-hosted, and one of the storage backends it supports is S3. You can use Tigris instead of S3 to pull images as fast as possible.Today, we'll be setting up a Docker registry backed by Tigris so you can push Docker images of any size into the cloud.
  
  
  Making your own Docker Registry on fly.io
In order to make the registry, you need a fly.io account. Sign up and then use this link to get $50 of compute credit on us.Make a new folder in your code folder for the registry:mkdir -p registry && cd registry
Then set up our template with :fly launch --from=https://github.com/tigrisdata-community/docker-registry --no-deploy
You won't need to tweak the settings.Create a tigris bucket using :Let Tigris pick a bucket name and then copy the secrets to your notes. You should get output like this:Your Tigris project (adjective-noun-1234) is ready. See details and next steps with: https://fly.io/docs/reference/tigris/

Setting the following secrets on tigris-registry:
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: tid_AzureDiamond
AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3: https://fly.storage.tigris.dev
AWS_REGION: auto
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: tsec_hunter2hunter2hunter2
BUCKET_NAME: delicate-sea-639
Copy the variables over according to this table:Fly storage create secretEnvironment variable in REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_BUCKETREGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_ACCESSKEYREGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_SECRETKEY# Change these settings
REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET=bucketName
REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_ACCESSKEY=tid_accessKey
REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_SECRETKEY=tsec_secretAccessKey

# Don't change these settings
REGISTRY_STORAGE=s3
REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_REGION=auto
REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_REGIONENDPOINT=https://fly.storage.tigris.dev
REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_FORCEPATHSTYLE=false
REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_ENCRYPT=false
REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_SECURE=true
REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_V4AUTH=true
REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_CHUNKSIZE=5242880
REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_ROOTDIRECTORY=/
Write this to  in your current working directory.Then import the secrets into your app:fly secrets import < .env
And add a randomly generated HTTP secret:fly secret set REGISTRY_HTTP_SECRET=$(uuidgen || uuid)
Once it’s up, you can push and pull like normal.Now that we have a private Docker registry, let's give it a whirl with smollm. Clone the example models repo and build smollm:docker build -t your-registry.fly.dev/models/smollm/135m:q4 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tigrisdata-community/models-in-docker/refs/heads/main/smollm/Dockerfile
Then push it to your registry:docker push your-registry.fly.dev/models/smollm/135m:q4
Then try to launch it with :fly machine run \
  -r sea \
  --vm-size l40s \
  --vm-gpu-kind l40s \
  your-registry.fly.dev/models/smollm:135m-q4
Copy the IP address to your clipboard (it should look like this: fdaa:0:641b:a7b:29b:b5b0:2009:2) and run  to get to it:fly proxy 8000 fdaa:0:641b:a7b:29b:b5b0:2009:2
Once you're done, make sure to destroy the machine with :Select the one in Seattle that's marked as running. Your registry should have went to sleep while you were experimenting.Right now this registry is open for anyone in the world to pull from and push to it. This is not ideal. In lack of a better option, we're going to use htpasswd authentication for the registry. In order to get this set up, we need to shut down the registry for a moment:And then start an ephemeral Alpine Machine with the htpasswd volume mounted:fly machine run --shell --command /bin/sh alpine
Once you're in, install the apache2-utils package to get the htpasswd command:Then create a password for your administrator user:htpasswd -B -c /data/htpasswd admin
It'll ask you for your password and write the result to . Repeat this for every person or bot that needs access to the registry. Make sure to save these passwords to a password manager as you will not be able to recover them later.Once you're done, exit out of the Alpine Machine and configure these secrets so that the Docker registry server will use that shiny new htpasswd file:fly secrets set REGISTRY_AUTH=htpasswd REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_REALM=basic-realm REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_PATH=/data/htpasswd
Then turn the registry back on:Finally, log into your registry with docker login:docker login tigris-registry.fly.dev -u admin
Paste your password, hit enter, and you're in!Here's what people without authentication will see:$ docker run --rm -it tigris-registry.fly.dev/alpine
Unable to find image 'tigris-registry.fly.dev/alpine:latest' locally
docker: Error response from daemon: failed to resolve reference "tigris-registry.fly.dev/alpine:latest": pull access denied, repository does not exist or may require authorization: authorization failed: no basic auth credentials.
See 'docker run --help'.
Today we learned how to make your own Docker image repository. You can use this to store anything (not just large language model inference servers).

At the heart of this revolution lies Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), a paradigm shift that will imbue our networks with a "sixth sense," transforming everything from how our cities operate to how we receive healthcare.Traditionally, wireless networks have been designed primarily for communication – transmitting and receiving data. Sensing, on the other hand, has relied on dedicated technologies like radar and LiDAR. ISAC breaks down this barrier by integrating these two functionalities into a single system. This means that the same radio signals used for communication can also be leveraged to detect, identify, and map objects and environments. Essentially, the network itself becomes a pervasive sensor, sharing resources and waveforms to achieve both communication and sensing simultaneously.
  
  
  Why is ISAC a Game-Changer for 6G?
Current sensing technologies, while effective, often operate in silos, leading to inefficiencies and limitations. ISAC addresses these by offering several key advantages. By sharing spectrum and hardware, ISAC promises enhanced accuracy, efficiency, and the ability to unlock entirely new possibilities. This convergence means that every device connected to the 6G network, from base stations to user equipment, could potentially act as a sensor, providing a far richer and more comprehensive understanding of the surrounding environment. As noted in a report by ETSI, ISAC is a major step toward identifying the critical functional and performance requirements necessary to support these cutting-edge use cases for 6G systems .The implications of ISAC are vast and will permeate nearly every aspect of our lives.Imagine urban environments that can dynamically adapt to real-time conditions. ISAC can enable hyper-accurate traffic management by precisely tracking vehicle movements and optimizing signal timings. Environmental monitoring will reach new levels of granularity, with sensors embedded in the network detecting air quality, noise levels, and even the structural integrity of buildings. For public safety, intelligent systems could detect unusual activity, assist in emergency response, and even locate individuals in distress.Beyond basic obstacle detection, ISAC will provide autonomous vehicles with an unprecedented understanding of their surroundings. High-resolution environmental mapping, precise localization even in GPS-denied areas, and the ability to anticipate pedestrian movements will make self-driving cars significantly safer and more efficient. The vehicle's communication system will simultaneously be its eyes and ears, perceiving the world around it with extreme precision.ISAC holds immense promise for revolutionizing healthcare. Remote patient monitoring will become more sophisticated, allowing for continuous tracking of vital signs, activity levels, and even fall detection for the elderly. This can enable proactive interventions and provide peace of mind for caregivers. In the long term, ISAC could even contribute to advanced medical imaging techniques, offering non-invasive ways to monitor health conditions.In industrial settings, ISAC can facilitate highly precise robot navigation, allowing for seamless collaboration between humans and machines. Predictive maintenance of machinery will become more accurate, as the network continuously monitors equipment for subtle signs of wear and tear, preventing costly breakdowns. Enhanced safety in industrial environments will be achieved through real-time awareness of personnel and equipment locations, mitigating potential hazards.
  
  
  Human-Computer Interaction
ISAC could fundamentally change how we interact with technology. Imagine intuitive gesture control where your movements are precisely tracked without the need for physical contact. Touchless interfaces could become commonplace, offering hygienic and seamless interactions. Furthermore, the ability to detect subtle physiological cues could even lead to emotion recognition, allowing devices to adapt to our mood and needs.
  
  
  Technical Deep Dive (Simplified)
Several underlying technologies are converging to make ISAC a reality:Terahertz (THz) communication: Operating at extremely high frequencies, THz bands offer massive bandwidth for communication and incredibly high resolution for sensing. This allows for detailed environmental mapping and precise object detection. The sheer volume of data generated by ISAC systems will be immense. Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms will be crucial for processing this data in real-time, extracting meaningful insights, and enabling intelligent decision-making for various applications.Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS): These passive surfaces can dynamically steer and focus wireless signals, enhancing signal propagation for both communication and sensing. RIS can extend network coverage, improve signal quality, and even enable sensing in challenging environments. For more insights into the future of wireless technology, visit exploring-next-gen-wireless.pages.dev.
  
  
  Challenges and Future Outlook
While the potential of ISAC is undeniable, several hurdles need to be addressed for its widespread deployment: The pervasive nature of ISAC raises significant concerns about data security and user privacy. Robust frameworks and regulations will be essential to ensure that sensitive sensing data is protected and used responsibly. Global standards are crucial for ensuring interoperability between different ISAC systems and devices. Without common protocols, fragmentation could hinder widespread adoption and limit the full potential of the technology.Computational Complexity: Processing the vast amounts of sensing data in real-time requires significant computational power. Continued advancements in hardware and software will be necessary to meet these demands. New regulations will be needed to govern the deployment and operation of ISAC applications, particularly concerning data privacy, spectrum allocation, and safety.ISAC is poised to transform our world, turning the invisible radio waves around us into a powerful "sixth sense" for our networks. While challenges remain, the collaborative efforts of researchers, industry, and policymakers will pave the way for a future where communication and sensing seamlessly merge, unlocking unprecedented levels of intelligence and connectivity.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>O Laboratório e o [FAILED]</title><link>https://dev.to/vgeruso/o-laboratorio-e-o-failed-4i5f</link><author>Victor Geruso Gomes</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 19:33:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ A alguns dias, resolvi bancar o cientista maluco e me meti num laboratório com o Ollama no meu Ubuntu.

Whether you are using tools like Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, Cursor, Cline, Postman, you name it; If a developer can plug in an MCP to it, they will. Having built a number of MCP servers recently at Airbyte, and running my own side hustle at mycaminoguide.com as an AI agent for the past year, I've learned a few things about what it really takes to build and run MCP servers. 
  
  
  Know the main components of an MCP server.
This might sound obvious, but knowing the main components of an MCP server is incredibly helpful as you build your own. It gives you a roadmap on what and how you want to implement services, and will save you significant time trying to custom code your own solutions when you should have used native MCP decorators and support.
Tools are functions clients can call to perform an action. Tools are what show up in something like Cursor. When designing an MCP, I typically start by thinking about the domain I want to work in. eg: functions a developer needs when working with my product, or calendar functions etc. From there I have a scope and can decide what actaul functions are available. If I find I am exceeding the domain, I typically create a separate MCP server. 
Resources allow your client to return specific data based on parameters. Resources are very helpful if your MCP service is going to perform some sort of query on a backend system. eg: My MCP offers a calendar service and I want to pass in a particular date to get availability.

Prompts are messages templates that include parameterized values that you can pass to an LLM to perform a query. I use prompts extensively within the PyAirbyte MCP server to allow the user to specify source and destination connectors. The MCP server then uses a consistent prompt and the OpenAI chat completion API to query the vector store for highly relevant results.
  
  
  Understand the Transports
Clients support different transports depending on your deployment model. If you are running locally, the transport is going to be stdio. Effectively, you configuring your mcp to execute a shell command to run a local file. I use stdio MCP services that I have built to help me automate frequent daily tasks such as checking the health of pipelines, looking at usage analytics, slack summaries etc from within Claude Desktop. I wouldn't recommend stdio for broader developer community facing tools. There is too much local config that the user needs to manage.Server Sent Events, or SSE, is the original transport for remote MCP servers. MCP servers built using this model require you to run a server such as Express or FastMCP to serve endpoints, both a POST and GET. Remote servers in general are not supported by Claude Desktop, but are supported in Cursor and Cline, although there are limitations, which I'll cover shortly. If you are starting to write MCP servers today, I would not recommend using SSE transports as they have been deprecated in favor of Streamable transports.Streamable HTTP transports removes the need to create two endpoints - a POST and GET - like you see in SSE transports and are slightly more complex to set up. Once you do have them configured though, there is a lot of benefits through scalability and resumable connections. In addition, they can work stateless meaning you can deploy them quite easily on Vercel vs. SSE services which you need to deploy on something like Railway or Heroku. The downside is that the Streamable HTTP transport is very new with Client tool vendors only now implementing it. There are positive sign though that this transport will become the most dominant. I've already see Claude Code implement a  parameter, for example.Most of my MCP development is done in python. Thankfully, there is a rich ecosystem of libraries available to that make working with MCP much easier. FastMCP is the defacto standard. It is fully spec-compliant, supports streaming transport, and is easily deployed.It's been interesting to see OpenAI support a competitors 'standard' (Anthrophic were the original authors of the MCP spec). As a heavy user of the Responses API in mycaminoguide.com, I've been excited to see that models can now use MCP servers to perform tasks. Currently the implementation doesn't feel very natural and there it's overly complex but the idea of an agent or model using my MCP server has me watching this space closely. Google is also pushing the same approach with their Agent SDK. 
  
  
  Not all Clients are created equal
When it client tools such as Claude Desktop, Cline, and Cursor, etc, the level of support for the MCP spec, and how this is represented in the mcp.json a user needs to add to connect a server can often lead to wasted time trying to figure out why an error is being raised. I have not found a centralized place where these differences are listed. Here are the ones I have encounteredLocal MCP server support: Claude Desktop, Cline, Cursor, Claude Code. Remote MCP server support: Cline, Cursor, Claude CodeRemote MCP server passing env in mcp.json: Cursor, Claude CodeThe remote MCP server with support for passing environment variables is a interesting case. For example, we just deployed an MCP server for PyAirbyte. This server uses openAI and a vector store to generate data pipelines. It is deployed on Heroku. As part of the client config, we require that you pass in your OpenAI API key. This works great within Cursor, but unfortunately it not supported in Cline. You can, of course, add values to a serverside .env file, but we did not want to do this due to the risk of someone spamming the MCP server and running up a bit OpenAI bill.MCP protocols are still evolving. Change is constant and can be frustrating when building services. Sometimes logging errors are not very helpful, and LLMs like ChatGPT often send you down a rabbit hole, only to find out that the spec has changed and the LLM doesn't have the most recent information. Vibe coding MCP servers can be an exercise in frustration. I hope these tips help you get started in building your own MCP servers and avoid some of the pitfalls I made when starting out. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Never-Ending Update: A Developer&apos;s Guide to Staying Sharp in the Tech World</title><link>https://dev.to/youtcode/the-never-ending-update-a-developers-guide-to-staying-sharp-in-the-tech-world-2e8k</link><author>Abdou yout</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 19:17:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The tech industry moves at a blistering pace.

Even most AI researchers were shocked at how well it could carry on a conversation, though it made a lot of mistakes and frequently just made stuff up.  Subsequent chatbots did even weirder things.  But they kept getting smarter and smarter, and today they are capable of doing a wide variety of pretty high-quality work on intellectual tasks.But you still hear people claiming that LLMs don't understand anything, that they are just "fancy autocorrect" and merely parrot things they have read on the internet.
  
  
  See Claude.  See Claude understand.
Today I had a fairly straightforward programming task: I was refactoring a set of global methods into a class.  I had Claude help me with it, as I often do (because it lets me get a lot more stuff done in a day).  Read the chat here, and pay attention to how I described the task, and how Claude described it.Consider the attached Python SimpleWriter class.  Its job is to write files representing a set of annotations.  Right now, each of the methods takes all the data it needs as parameters; the class carries no data.
I would like to refactor this so that all the parameters to format_info, as well as a sequence of LineAnnotation objects, are properties of the SimpleWriter object.  So usage would be:
    Create a SimpleWriter, perhaps providing the dimensions, lower_bound, and upper_bound.
    Assign the spatial_specs, property_specs, and relationships (which should all default to empty lists so you can immediately .append to them).
    Call a write method, passing in a dir_path parameter.
Other methods are all helper methods that would be called internally.and then gave a sketch of what that  method would look like.  Claude responded:I'll refactor the SimpleWriter class to make it stateful as you requested. Here's the refactored version.And then it did the task perfectly.  (Even matching my style for function comments, which differs from what Claude does by default.)Note that I never used the term "stateful."  That's exactly the right term for what I described, but I never said that; I just described the particulars of my problem.  The particulars are unique; this is all code I wrote myself today, and is unlikely to exist anywhere else on the internet.So Claude took a detailed breakdown of a task, and understood the big picture.  It recognized that those details amount to making the class stateful, and that my task could be described (much more simply) as such.If that's not understanding, I don't know what is.I think a lot of people still claim computers can't understand things because they can't imagine how they  understand things.  After all, aren't they just a giant pile of numbers and math?Well, they are, but then you and I are just a giant pile of squishy cells ingesting and excreting calcium and other ions.  Yet we are able to understand things.  How is  possible?The answer is that the particular values of the numbers in an artificial neural network — or the particular firing rates of neurons in a biological one —  something.  It has meaning because, through experience and training, connections have formed that allow certain patterns to represent concepts, and the relationships those concepts have to other concepts.  That's what meaning .  When my task description was fed to Claude, it caused high-dimensional vectors (strings of numbers) to form that represented the steps in the task, the details of the code, and so on.  Those concepts get combined and manipulated in ways that Claude has been trained to do, ways that contribute to its goal of being a helpful chatbot.  And those manipulations link the detailed concepts to higher-level concepts like "make it stateful."When you have a neural network (of either type) that's big enough, and it's been trained on enough data, it does things that in humans we call "thinking" and "understanding."  It's amazing that this works, but it does.Well, it appears that we have, at least in the big picture, cracked the secret of how brains work.  We can build machines now that think and understand.  Maybe not exactly the same way we do it, but similar enough.  That lets us making these amazing helpers, and also helps us understand ourselves a little better.But just as AIs have gotten a lot smarter since 2022, they are going to  to get smarter.  I keep an eye on the AI research papers coming out all the time, and there is no shortage of improvements in the pipeline.  And in fact there are places where AIs are themselves proposing and carrying out research to improve AI.  This is a feedback loop that will probably really get into gear in the next year or two.So we're in for exciting times ahead.  Hang on! Want to keep your critical thinking skills sharp, despite using chatbots in your work?    It's fun and easy.

At the heart of this revolution lies the Application Programming Interface (API), the fundamental building block of modern software. GenAI is not merely optimizing existing processes; it's fundamentally reshaping the entire API lifecycle, from initial design to deployment, consumption, and ongoing management. This shift promises unprecedented levels of automation, efficiency, and intelligence in how software interacts.
  
  
  AI-Driven API Design: From Natural Language to OpenAPI
Traditionally, API design has been a meticulous, human-intensive process, often beginning with conceptualization and then translating those ideas into formal specifications like OpenAPI (formerly Swagger). GenAI is poised to automate this crucial initial phase. Large Language Models (LLMs) can now interpret natural language descriptions of desired API functionalities and automatically generate robust OpenAPI specifications. This capability drastically accelerates the design phase, allowing developers to iterate on ideas faster and ensure consistency across their API ecosystems. Imagine simply describing an endpoint's purpose, its inputs, and expected outputs, and having a ready-to-use specification generated in moments. This streamlines the development process and reduces time-to-market for new APIs, a key benefit highlighted by experts.
  
  
  Automated API Documentation: Making APIs More Accessible
One of the persistent challenges in API adoption is often the quality and clarity of documentation. Poorly documented APIs can hinder developer experience and slow down integration. GenAI offers a powerful solution by enabling LLMs to generate clear, context-aware documentation and usage examples. These models can analyze API specifications and even existing codebases to produce comprehensive guides, tutorials, and code snippets in various programming languages. This not only lightens the burden on technical writers but also makes APIs significantly more accessible and easier to implement for developers of all skill levels, fostering a more vibrant developer community around them.
  
  
  Intelligent API Testing: Enhancing Quality and Security
The quality and reliability of APIs are paramount. GenAI is transforming API testing by enabling the automated generation of comprehensive test cases. AI can analyze API specifications, understand expected behaviors, and even learn from past interactions to create diverse test scenarios, including edge cases and negative tests that might be overlooked by human testers. Beyond functional testing, GenAI plays a critical role in identifying potential vulnerabilities. By simulating various attack vectors and analyzing API responses for anomalies, AI-powered testing tools can uncover security flaws before they are exploited. This proactive approach significantly improves API quality and security, a vital aspect given the increasing frequency of API attacks, as predicted by research from API platform Kong, which forecasts a tenfold increase by 2030.
  
  
  Enhanced API Security: Real-time Threat Detection and Zero Trust
With the proliferation of APIs in modern distributed architectures, API security has become a critical concern. Traditional security methods often struggle to keep pace with the sheer volume and complexity of API traffic. GenAI is revolutionizing this domain through AI-powered monitoring systems that can detect real-time threats and anomalies in API traffic. These systems use machine learning algorithms to establish baselines of normal behavior and flag deviations that could indicate malicious activity, such as unauthorized access attempts, data exfiltration, or denial-of-service attacks. This contrasts sharply with traditional signature-based methods, which are often reactive.Furthermore, the rise of zero-trust architectures in API security is gaining momentum. As outlined by TechTarget, zero trust assumes no implicit trust for any entity, requiring continuous authentication and authorization for every API request. AI can bolster zero-trust implementations by continuously verifying user identities, device health, and request contexts, ensuring that only legitimate and authorized interactions occur. This layered approach provides a more robust defense against evolving cyber threats.
  
  
  Code Generation for API Integration: Reducing Boilerplate
One of the most immediate and tangible benefits of GenAI for developers is its ability to assist in writing code for API consumption and integration. Developers often spend considerable time writing boilerplate code to interact with APIs, handle data parsing, and manage authentication. GenAI models, trained on vast code repositories, can generate client-side code, SDKs, and integration logic based on API specifications or even natural language prompts. This significantly reduces manual coding effort, accelerates development cycles, and allows developers to focus on higher-value business logic.For example, using a GenAI API like Google Gemini or OpenAI to generate an API endpoint description in Python:And a pseudo-code example illustrating how an AI might generate test cases for a given API endpoint:These examples demonstrate the practical application of GenAI in streamlining development workflows.
  
  
  The Future of API Management: Autonomous and Self-Optimizing Platforms
The influence of GenAI extends beyond individual development tasks to the broader realm of API management. In the future, GenAI could lead to more autonomous and self-optimizing API management platforms. These platforms would leverage AI to: Automatically adjust API gateway resources based on anticipated traffic patterns. Optimize API request routing for lower latency and higher reliability.Proactive Issue Resolution: Identify and even resolve API performance bottlenecks or errors before they impact users.Automated Policy Enforcement: Dynamically apply security and rate-limiting policies based on real-time threat intelligence and usage patterns.This evolution promises a future where API infrastructures are more resilient, efficient, and require less manual intervention, further solidifying the role of APIs in modern software.
  
  
  Benefits and Challenges of the Generative API Revolution
The Generative API revolution brings a multitude of benefits: Automating repetitive tasks across the API lifecycle. Accelerating design, development, and deployment of APIs.Improved Developer Experience: Making APIs easier to understand, integrate, and use. Proactive threat detection and robust security measures. Optimizing resource utilization and operational workflows.However, this transformative shift is not without its challenges:Increased Infrastructure Demands: Running and training sophisticated GenAI models requires substantial computational resources.Potential Reliability Issues with AI-Generated Code: AI-generated code may not always be perfect and could introduce bugs or inefficiencies, necessitating careful human review. AI models themselves can be vulnerable to new types of attacks, such as adversarial examples or data poisoning.Higher Energy Consumption: The computational intensity of GenAI contributes to increased energy demands.As explored by Codiste, successful GenAI API integration requires careful planning, addressing challenges like authentication, efficient data management, latency, scalability, and graceful error handling.The Generative API Revolution is fundamentally reshaping how software is built and integrated. By infusing intelligence and automation into every stage of the API lifecycle, GenAI is driving a new era of software development characterized by unprecedented speed, efficiency, and innovation. While challenges remain, the benefits for developers and businesses alike are too significant to ignore, paving the way for a more intelligent and interconnected digital future.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🚀 Ollama Dev Stack: WebUI + Benchmark + Docker + Fallback (Open Source)</title><link>https://dev.to/rafael_mori/ollama-dev-stack-webui-benchmark-docker-fallback-open-source-294</link><author>Rafael Mori</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 17:45:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Their platform needed to remain affordable for individual developers, all while ingesting 10s of TBs in mere hours, storing 100+ TBs of data around the globe, and offering real time responses.
  
  
  Inference faster than you can type
Obsessed with optimization, fal.ai knows that every second counts on their GPUs. They upload output images in background threads so the only GPU time charged is for actual inference. Their researchers constantly test their production models against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) to find the best performing architectures for task precision, reliability, and reduced generation time. Every extra millisecond is shaved off, making fal.ai an order of magnitude more performant than their competitors for many generative ai tasks.fal.ai has built custom infrastructure and optimized the model inference to make sure these models are served to the end user as fast as possible. fal.ai has a globally distributed network of GPUs to make sure the inference happens as close to the user as possible. We do very little hops from between the user and the GPU. 
—Burkay Gur, Co-founder fal.aiBringing the cutting-edge into industry requires translating both academic research and the latest community-driven workflows, into live, performant systems. And they mean performance— completely saturated 10Gb links, 1GB/s+ writes, squeezing every last bit of juice from a global fleet of GPUs across many clouds. Every step from training to inference pipelines is carefully optimized and purpose built. Each network hop is scrutinized.fal.ai tried other providers with no egress fees, but none of them met their reliability and performance needs. Low throughput, sluggish downloads, and intermittent 500 errors made it impossible to guarantee their diffusion endpoints could process requests in real time. After partnering with Tigris, fal.ai didn’t need to choose between performance, reliability, and cost.have been using @TigrisData at @fal for the last 2 months. ingested 10s of TBs of data in mere hours while storing 100 TB+ without any hassle. much much more reliable than anything else we have used. and also MUCH FASTER. i am impressed honestly. thanks @martin_casado for rec 
—Batuhan Taskaya, Head of Engineering at fal.aiImage generation, video generation, upscaling images, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, all sorts of media related functionality— keeping up with the latest and greatest models and tools is a lot for any developer. And it’s often unclear which models can keep up with a production deployment. fal.ai is a unified hub for integrating these models as reliable utilities.

  Unlimited horizontal scaling at an 85% discount with Tigris
Sending data around so many GPUs across so many clouds could lead to a dizzyingly high egress bill. Other zero egress cost storage providers struggle to meet the stringent performance requirements of modern platforms. Finding a storage solution built for an extremely performant global deployment was essential to keeping fal.ai accessible to a broad range of developers.Not only was Tigris “just crazy fast,” it saved fal.ai 85% on their object storage costs as compared to other clouds with egress fees. With cost no longer limiting their object storage, fal.ai unlocked limitless horizontal scale.This article was originally published on September 18, 2024 at tigrisdata.com/blog]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Buy Google Reviews</title><link>https://dev.to/reviews123444/buy-google-reviews-2m5</link><author>Buy Reviews Provider</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 17:39:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Buy Google Review

We were promised flying cars, a post-AI utopia, and robots doing our laundry.
Instead, we got:Infinite job applications.And AI that can build a fully functional SaaS in 7 minutes… while sipping boba.So here’s your friendly, slightly-too-caffeinated reminder of why getting a software developer job in 2025  — and also, why we’re still sticking around, pushing code and breaking prod.
  
  
  1. Big Tech Doesn’t Care About Your Glorious Side Projects AnymoreOh, you built an open source app that’s basically Notion but for cats?
You added auth, you dockerized it, you wrote tests, and even made a dark mode before it was cool?Cool. Google just fed it to Gemini 12.4. Now it’s launching the same thing… but with 10x better UX and 1000x more compute power — thanks to their infinite Kubernetes clusters and a latte budget bigger than your yearly salary.You thought you were getting noticed. But you just got... cloned.Big companies now look at your portfolio and go, “Aww, cute. Look what the human made.”They’re not impressed. Why? Because they’ve got AI agents that can write code, do code reviews, generate documentation, and probably even explain  correctly —  (and TypeScript is one of them).
  
  
  2. Mid-Sized Companies Are Ghosting Harder Than Your Last Hinge DateRemember when losing one engineer meant a company would post a job, interview 20 people, and onboard someone within a month?“Jason left? No worries. We’ll just give everything to Jane. She’s got ChatGPT and a double espresso machine.”Turns out AI didn’t just help devs become more productive… it helped managers realize . Less hiring. Less onboarding. More “Can you just ChatGPT this and get it done?”Mid-sized companies have entered their ✨“We’re not hiring anymore” ✨ era. Even when people leave. Even when their internal tools are crashing like Internet Explorer in 2006.
  
  
  3. Too Many Devs, Not Enough ChairsThere are officially more software developers than soldiers in most countries. (No seriously, someone please tell NATO.)It’s like musical chairs, but instead of music stopping, AI just keeps playing lo-fi beats to code/cry to and you realize all the chairs are taken by folks who started coding before Stack Overflow existed.Bootcamp grads, CS grads, self-taught devs, weekend warriors — we’re all here, and we all want to work. But there are fewer and fewer seats at the table.Especially now that AI tools have replaced half the junior dev jobs.
Because hey — why pay a junior dev when you can get , ,  GPT?
  
  
  4. World War...? While I’m Writing CSS?Fun fact: As I write this, somewhere in the world, a literal war is breaking out.And here I am, struggling with a flexbox bug that refuses to center anything — except my existential dread.Tensions are rising, economies are unsure, and even stable companies are starting to say, “Hmm, maybe we shouldn’t hire a whole new mobile team when a war might knock the internet out next week.”I mean, what a time to be alive, right?
  
  
  5. But Still… I Freaking Love This JobOkay okay. Time for a plot twist.Despite all this doom and gloom, I’ll say it:I genuinely love what I do.I’m a mobile dev. I work with React Native and Flutter. I build things that I love.
I design responsive UIs that make me go “damn, that looks good” (and yes, sometimes cry when padding doesn’t work).
I’ve built weird things, broken even weirder things, and once — I pushed secrets to GitHub.
I’ve made mistakes. Beautiful mistakes. The kind that teach you things no AI ever could.I’m not doing this because it pays well (though it used to). I’m doing it because I  making stuff.
Because nothing compares to shipping something , even if no one but your mom uses it.And I know I’m not alone.Most devs I know — we’re still here. Still trying. Still learning.
We take pride in our janky UIs, clever animations, and handcrafted API integrations that  work.We aren’t doing this for the job market anymore.
We’re doing this because .Honestly?
If you still love this — .Learn new things. Build dumb things. Build cool things. Post about it. Talk about it.
Contribute to open source, even if your PR gets ignored for 8 months.And hey — if you’re into learning the  internals, like building your own Git, Redis, or Docker from scratch (aka getting  by your own code), I  recommend checking out CodeCrafters.(You’ll cry. But like… the good kind of cry. The "wow I didn’t know how CPUs work" cry.)Jobs are fewer, companies care less, and devs are .But if you still love building — you’re not alone.We’re all here, writing bugs and breaking prod together.And honestly? That’s kind of beautiful.So here’s to all the devs still pushing code in 2025, still loving what they do,
still learning, still shipping — even if no one’s hiring.Keep going. You’re doing great. And you’re not the only one.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>RAFFI777 : 99+ Kumpulan Slot Games Seru Mudah Maxwin Paling Affordable</title><link>https://dev.to/raffi777/raffi777-99-kumpulan-slot-games-seru-mudah-maxwin-paling-affordable-4j0n</link><author>raffi 777</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 17:13:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[*RAFFI777 : 99+ Kumpulan Slot Games Seru Mudah Maxwin Paling Affordable

I was there too, until I discovered a CLI-based coding agent that I can run right in my terminal.One of the CLI-based coding agents I recently came across is Forgecode, and I have experimented a lot with this tool. To help you understand its capabilities in the terminal, I have jotted down 10 real-world ways I’ve been using Forgecode in enterprise development.These coding agents integrate smoothly with existing workflows (no new IDEs to learn) and act as a “complete coding agent” that can “write, refactor, and optimize code based on specifications,” debug complex problems, generate test suites, document code, propose architectural improvements, and more. In short, missing out on this AI shell means missing out on a secret weapon in your dev toolkit.
  
  
  1. Writing and optimizing code from specs
One of the first things I tried was having Forge turn a specification into working code. For example, I had a spec for a Python function to convert timestamps to ISO format. I opened my project repo in the terminal and ran something like:$ forge -p "Write a Python function that converts a Unix timestamp to an ISO 8601 formatted string."Within seconds, Forgecode analyzed the context (my project’s Python environment) and returned a complete function, even suggesting optimizations like using Python’s built-in datetime module instead of manual parsing. In one case, I asked it to implement an email-sending handler from a written API spec. Forge not only generated the handler code, but also optimized it (batch-sending if multiple emails) on the fly. I didn’t have to explain the surrounding code – Forge read my project files and tailored its output accordingly. This workflow of “tell the agent what I need, get code” made feature prototyping absurdly fast. (In fact, Forge’s docs show similar behavior – it can “scaffold the necessary components” when adding features like a dark mode toggle.)
  
  
  2. Debugging complex issues
Next, I handed Forge cryptic runtime errors and bugs. For example, one day my Node.js app threw a mysterious TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined. Instead of diving into code, I ran:$ forge -p "Why am I getting 'TypeError: Cannot read property \"map\" of undefined' in my UserProfile component?"Forgecode immediately scanned the code, pinpointed that my array variable was null, and suggested guard clauses around it. It walked me through the likely cause and fix, effectively doing initial bug triage. This matched the official Forge behavior – given an error like that, Forge “will analyze the error, suggest potential causes based on your code, and propose different solutions”. I was impressed how it highlighted a missing initialization in our Redux store (something I had overlooked). In another incident, I pasted a multi-page Python stack trace into Forge and it quickly isolated which import was failing. For enterprise-scale projects with tangled dependencies, having an AI assistant sift through logs and point at the faulty module is a huge time-saver.
  
  
  3. Generating test suites
Writing tests is vital but tedious. Forge has become my automated test engineer. Suppose I finish implementing a new function calculateShippingCost(order). I open the code file, inspect it, then ask Forge to write tests:$ forge -p "Generate a set of Jest unit tests for the calculateShippingCost(order) function, covering edge cases."Forge returns a comprehensive test suite covering normal inputs and failure cases (e.g. negative order values, missing fields). It even comments the tests with explanations. I can simply copy those into a calculateShippingCost.test.js file and run them. On another project, I had to boost test coverage quickly for an audit, so I pointed Forge at an untested utility class, and it autogenerates Mocha tests. The productivity jump is real: instead of manually writing dozens of assertions, Forge does the heavy lifting. (Under the hood, it’s following the guidance that “unit tests should be included for all new functions,” as I set in my config.) Even better, the tests it generates are actually runnable – I’ve used Forge many times to catch regressions before even running them manually.
  
  
  4. Code documentation and tech specs
I treat Forge like a technical writer too. After coding a tricky algorithm, I often ask Forge to produce docstrings or design docs. For example:$ forge -p "Document the function calculateTax in detail, including its parameters, return values, and an example."It replies with a clear docstring or markdown snippet I can drop into my code or README. In one case, I showed Forge a legacy YAML workflow and asked: “Explain what this CI/CD pipeline is doing step by step.” Forge parsed the config and output a human-readable summary of each job. It even created a spec for a REST API I was planning: “Create an OpenAPI description for an endpoint that takes {userId} and returns profile data.” The result was a boilerplate YAML spec which I refined. Forge also summarized complex modules: pointing it at a class, it paraphrased the logic into plain English. This utility is priceless during code review or knowledge transfer – new team members get up to speed faster because I can run a quick “explain this file” prompt. (While not in official examples, this use of Forge naturally follows its “analyze project structure and explain flow” pattern.)
  
  
  5. Architectural suggestions
Forge isn’t just for small tasks; I even use it for high-level design. When planning a new microservice, I ask it for architecture advice. For example, I prompted:$ forge -p "Propose a scalable microservices architecture for an e-commerce order processing system."Forge reviewed our codebase and existing services (it can see our folder structure) and suggested splitting order intake, payment, and shipping into separate containers. It recommended a message queue between order creation and fulfillment, and identified an appropriate database model. Even if not 100% production-ready, the suggestions give a solid starting point. In one case, I described our data needs and asked, “What database schema fits a blog with users, posts, comments, and categories?” Forge produced a schema with tables and relationships – exactly as seen in its docs example of “design a database schema for a blog”. For system-wide questions (“Should we use SQL or NoSQL for this data?”), it weighs pros/cons based on our project. This kind of architectural brainstorming with an AI avoided weeks of indecision: I could iterate on high-level ideas via chat until I had a plan.When jumping into an unfamiliar codebase, Forge is like a senior dev ready to answer questions. Early on I asked it to explain our authentication flow:$ forge -p "Explain how the authentication system works in this codebase."True to form, Forge parsed multiple files (middleware, user model, controllers) and described the end-to-end process: from login request to JWT creation, mentioning the key modules involved. This matches the behavior in Forge’s docs – “analyze your project’s structure” and provide a detailed explanation. It even highlighted where OAuth tokens were verified. On a large Java codebase, it outlined which classes handled database access vs. business logic, which was a huge help onboarding. For one particularly gnarly service, I ran forge -p "Summarize the purpose of each endpoint in this Spring controller." and got back a neat list of endpoints and their functions. Basically, any time I or a colleague asks “What does this code do?” Forge often has a quick, accurate answer after scanning the context. It’s invaluable during architecture reviews or when deciphering a coworker’s pull request.
  
  
  7. Feature implementation
Adding new features is where Forge shines. We often describe requirements in natural language and let it draft the skeleton. For instance, to add a dark mode toggle to our React app, I typed:$ forge -p "Implement a dark mode toggle in our React application."Forge responded with a plan: update the global stylesheet, add a toggle component, and even provided example JSX for the button and corresponding CSS variables. It suggested storing preference in localStorage – exactly what our team ended up using. I then instructed it, “Write the React component for the toggle,” and it gave clean code with propTypes and comments. This workflow mirrors Forge’s own example: when asked about a dark mode toggle, “Forge will suggest the best approach… and even scaffold the necessary components”. In another case, we needed to add logging middleware to an Express server; I told Forge what we had, and it generated a logger.js file using morgan. It even explained how to integrate it. It’s like having a senior engineer draft the boilerplate for each new feature so I can focus on fine-tuning the logic.
  
  
  8. Troubleshooting and debugging (environment issues)
Beyond code bugs, Forge has helped troubleshoot environment and deployment problems. For example, our CI pipeline suddenly started failing with a generic Docker permission error. I asked:$ forge -p "Our Docker build is failing with a permission denied error when creating a directory. What could be wrong?"Forge analyzed common causes and noticed that we were creating files as root in the container without setting correct ownership. It suggested using chown or running as a non-root user, exactly the fix needed. In another scenario, a colleague had trouble with environment variables not loading in production. I described the .env setup to Forge, and it pointed out that our Dockerfile forgot to copy .env before npm install. By following Forge’s hint, we caught the misconfiguration quickly. Essentially, I treat the CLI as a first-pass troubleshooter for any issue – whether it’s a segmentation fault, a failing test, or a flaky Jenkins job, prompting Forge often surfaces the root cause or next steps. (This is the natural extension of its “debugging assistance” role into ops land.)
  
  
  9. Refactoring legacy systems
Dealing with old, tangled code used to be daunting. Now I use Forge to modernize and refactor. For example, we had a decade-old PHP module that needed cleaning. I told Forge:$ forge -p "Refactor this legacy function to improve readability and error handling."It rewrote the function in a more modular way, adding try/catch and renaming variables for clarity. In another case (and matching its documentation example), I asked it to convert a class-based React component to hooks:$ forge -p "Refactor the class-based UserProfile component to use React Hooks instead."Forge walked through each part – moving state into useState, replacing lifecycle methods with useEffect – and gave the new functional component. The transformation was smooth and correct; I only needed minor edits afterward. This exactly follows the example from the docs, where Forge “can help modernize your codebase” by refactoring class components to hooks. Across the board, using Forge to do the grunt work of restructuring means I’m less scared of touching legacy code. I’m essentially “pair programming” with the AI to incrementally modernize our tech debt.
  
  
  10. Git operations and history management
Finally, Forge has become a handy assistant for Git too. I’ll often prompt it to handle version control tasks. For instance, I needed to merge a stale feature branch with conflicts:$ forge -p "Merge branch 'feature/login' into 'main' and help resolve any conflicts."Forge scanned the diff and interactively suggested how to reconcile differences, even auto-editing conflict markers. In one real case, it noticed a key rename conflict and recommended keeping the latest schema change. This aligns with Forge’s own git example: given a merge with conflicts, “Forge can guide you through resolving git conflicts”. I’ve also used it to generate conventional commit messages: by installing a small custom command, I can run /commit and Forge writes a semantic commit message for me (e.g. “feat(login): add remember-me checkbox”). For release management, I asked Forge to summarize commit history and it produced a changelog draft. Essentially, any time I’m doing branch juggling, blame analysis, or PR writing, Forge smooths the process. In fact, the documentation even shows custom Git commands in forge.yaml, like automating commit or PR generation. I can’t count how many hours I’ve saved by letting an AI prepare my git commands and messages.And if you like what you see, ⭐ Star the GitHup repo to stay in the loop and support the project!
  
  
  Ready to supercharge your workflow?
I was skeptical at first, but Forgecode’s CLI assistant has become my most-used dev tool. By integrating right into my terminal (no context switch to a web UI), it feels like a natural extension of my dev environment. And it’s just a few steps to get started:Install it via NPM (npm i -g @antinomyhq/forge), set your FORGE_KEY from forgecode.dev, and run forge. That’s it.Forge is now ready to assist you with your development tasks.If you care about shipping code faster and smarter, give Forge CLI a try – your future commits (and your team) will thank you!CLI tools like Forge are quietly reshaping how enterprise teams build software. They keep developers in the terminal. With Forge, routine and even complex tasks (from coding to docs to CI) become faster and less error-prone. There’s nothing mystical about it. it’s just a smart agent that plugs into your shell and leverages your context. And because it runs locally with your own API keys, it stays secure and private.If you haven’t tried it yet, I encourage you to give Forge a spin. Install the CLI, connect your model of choice, and start asking it to “fix this bug” or “generate tests.” You may find that adding this AI assistant to your team accelerates development velocity more than you expected. After all, the future of enterprise development is collaborative and agentic – don’t miss out on how Forge can help your team build smarter and faster.Let me know your experience!!!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🧠 EPYQ Week 4/12: Memory Intelligence</title><link>https://dev.to/the_epyq/epyq-week-412-memory-intelligence-44ca</link><author>Pratham Gupta</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Introduction: The Memory MythLet’s get this straight: hoarding data isn’t intelligence. Sure, memory is useful—like a filing cabinet—but intelligence is not just how much you can store or recall. Today’s AI giants brag about “billions of parameters” and “massive datasets” like that alone means something profound. Spoiler alert: it doesn’t.Memory is a tool. Intelligence is the art of  it wisely.Section I: Why Bigger Memory Doesn’t Mean Smarter AIIt’s tempting to think that stuffing a system with more data automatically makes it more intelligent. That’s like believing a library packed with books is smarter than a single philosopher. Quantity ≠ quality.Models like GPT-4 are impressive parrots because of their huge training data. But they don’t  that data. They just statistically predict what should come next.Even if you had a model with infinite memory, if it just regurgitates, it’s no smarter than a tape recorder.Section II: The Illusion of Token MemoryToken memory — the idea that AI remembers previous words or sentences — is nothing more than sliding windows of context. It doesn’t mean the AI  or . It’s just a fancy autocomplete.True intelligence requires more than context. It requires meaning, continuity, and self-reference. AI today has none of that. It’s trapped in the moment, unable to  or  based on long-term experience.Section III: Humans vs Machines: The Memory DifferenceHuman memory isn’t just a dump of facts. It’s selective, reconstructive, and deeply intertwined with emotions and goals.We forget what’s irrelevant. We link concepts creatively. We generalize from experience. We  about our memories and question them.AI can’t do any of this. It remembers, but it doesn’t . It stores, but it doesn’t .Section IV: Why Intelligence Is About Interaction, Not StorageIntelligence is dynamic. It’s about interacting with the environment, updating your beliefs, questioning your assumptions, and learning from failure.Memory alone is passive. Intelligence is active.The difference? Memory is a library. Intelligence is a library  its librarian — the one who decides what to read, what to write, and what to throw out.Section V: The EPYQ Approach: From Memory to MeaningEPYQ doesn’t just stack data. It builds  that , , and  knowledge continuously.It’s not about how much it remembers, but how it  what it remembers to create new understanding.HyperMind AGI’s blueprint incorporates recursive self-reflection, meta-cognition, and emergent schemas — turning static memory into a living, evolving intelligence.Section VI: The Danger of Mistaking Memory for IntelligenceOvervaluing memory leads to complacency. Companies and researchers focus on training bigger models instead of designing truly intelligent architectures.This is why today’s AI is impressive but limited—great at regurgitating, terrible at innovating.EPYQ’s vision shatters this trap. Intelligence is not a warehouse, but a workshop.Conclusion: Break Free From the Memory FetishStop glorifying memory. Stop pretending that bigger data means smarter minds.True intelligence transcends memory — it questions it, builds upon it, and transforms it.At EPYQ, memory is just the start. Intelligence is the journey.🧠 Week 5 – The Self-Awareness LoopWe dive deep into recursive cognitive meta-loops — the secret sauce that lets an AGI know itself and grow autonomously.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Understanding Application Performance with Roofline Modeling</title><link>https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-application-performance-with-roofline-modeling/</link><author>Rachit Jain</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 16:55:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://towardsdatascience.com/">Towards Data Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A common challenge with calculating an application’s performance is that the real-world performance and theoretical performance can differ.

The goal? Just type in the details of your meeting, and boom — Runner H creates a clean, ready-to-use Google Doc titled with the meeting name and structured with your agenda.This agent is for anyone (like me!) who constantly has to jot down meeting notes, agendas, or brainstorms and just wants to skip the repetitive formatting and file creation. It takes 10 seconds instead of 10 minutes.Here’s how I set it up:
Connected my Google Docs account to Runner H.
Prompted Runner H like this:
“Create a Google Doc titled ‘[Meeting Name]’ with this agenda:
Project progress
Next steps”Runner H instantly created a well-formatted Google Doc in my Drive — no extra clicks, no templates, no chaos.You can easily replicate this by typing your own meeting title and points — that’s it! No code, no learning curve.If you’ve ever scrambled 2 minutes before a call to create a doc, or juggled messy notes across apps, this is your fix. It’s great for:
Freelancers and teams documenting client calls
Students prepping group work agendas
Startups managing stand-ups or sprint planning
Anyone who wants to stop reinventing the wheel every time they need a documentIt doesn’t try to do everything — just one thing really well.

I’ve built prototypes, tested frameworks, broken things, and occasionally gotten something to work the way I intended.It’s been exciting — but also humbling.There’s a lot of hype out there, and while much of it is grounded in genuine progress, I’ve seen first-hand how different the day-to-day reality is from the glossy demos and blog posts.If you’re getting started with AI agents or just curious about what it’s really like, here are eight honest takeaways from my experience.1. Most “AI Agents” Aren’t Really AgentsYou’ve probably seen demos of AI agents that can schedule appointments, handle customer support, or generate content for your brand. They look polished. They seem smart. But here’s the truth:Most of these are just well-structured workflows with a bit of LLM magic sprinkled in.They aren’t making real decisions. They’re running predefined steps — like “if the message includes a time, call the calendar API” — and using the LLM only to interpret input or format output. That’s automation, not agency.If you’re expecting autonomy, judgment, or adaptation, you’ll be disappointed — unless you build it yourself.2. We’re Early. Really Early.There’s a shared moment a lot of people have when they first dive into AI: “This is going to replace us.”And maybe it will, someday. But not today.As developers, we already know where AI can help right now — drafting code, writing tests, summarizing input. But there are still major limitations in reasoning, context retention, memory, and reliability.AI agents aren’t anywhere close to replacing full-time employees in most domains. There’s a long road ahead.3. The Happy Path Isn’t Enough
Almost every tutorial or demo out there shows the same types of agents: the travel assistant, the research bot, the meeting note taker.They’re helpful — but they only show the “happy path.” The scenario where everything works, every tool returns a valid result, and the user asks perfect questions.Building real agents means dealing with broken APIs, vague input, long-running tasks, and dead ends. The real world is messy — your agents need to be prepared for that.4. Agents Are Slow (and That’s a Problem)One of the biggest performance surprises when building agents is how slow they can be.You’re likely calling an LLM multiple times, invoking tools or APIs, chaining results, and possibly routing through sub-agents. Each step adds latency.Unlike ChatGPT — where billions have been spent on speed and optimization — your custom agent lives in your infra. And speed will matter to your users.If you want the experience to feel responsive, you’ll need to optimize around latency: infrastructure, parallelism, UI tricks like optimistic rendering — whatever you can do to mask the delay.5. Tooling Is Easy. Prompting Is Hard.Writing the code to call a tool? Easy.Getting your agent to consistently decide when to call that tool — and how to use it — based on messy, real-world inputs? Not so easy.Prompts are where most of the real work happens. They’re fragile. Small wording changes can completely shift the model’s behavior. And you’ll spend a lot of time iterating, debugging, and rephrasing.It can be frustrating. But when you finally get a clean, natural response chain — it’s worth it.6. Modularity Comes at a CostAs engineers, we’re trained to decompose problems into smaller units — functions, services, components.It’s tempting to do the same with agents: one for scheduling, one for research, one for recommendations, and a router that directs traffic.That works, but it introduces two big problems:
    • Context fragmentation: It becomes harder to maintain state across multiple agents.
    • Latency overhead: Every routing decision is another round-trip with the model or server.Sometimes, fewer agents with more tightly scoped memory works better than trying to modularize everything too early.7. Prompting > Coding (and That’s the Job)
If you want to get good at building agents, you need to get good at writing prompts.Use Gemini, ChatGPT, or your LLM of choice to help generate and improve them. But don’t blindly trust the output. Always read it. Test it. Make sure the behavior aligns with what you intended.Too many devs treat LLMs like a black box that “just works.” That leads to brittle systems. If you’re not reading and refining your prompts, you’re not really building.8. Frameworks Matter, but Start SimpleMy first experience building agents was with LangGraph. It’s powerful and flexible — but also low-level and hard to grasp at first. The documentation isn’t always clear, and there are often multiple ways to solve the same problem.If you’re just getting started, pick a simpler tool and focus on getting something working.In my case, I eventually moved to Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK). It’s easy to use, supports multi-agent flows, tool integration, memory, and works great with Google’s infrastructure like MCP and A2A.I’ve used it since the early versions and reported a few bugs — the team behind it is active and responsive, and the framework has improved fast.Building AI agents is hard. It’s not magic. It’s not plug-and-play. But it is possible — and incredibly satisfying when it works.The biggest unlock isn’t the model. It’s how you design your prompts, your tools, your UX, and your system architecture to work with the model — not against it.I’d love to hear your perspective:What lessons have you learned while building or exploring AI agents? What’s worked — and what hasn’t?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Evangelist Apps</title><link>https://dev.to/evangelist_apps_943d5150a/evangelist-apps-2fbe</link><author>Evangelist Apps</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 16:37:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Evangelist Apps is a UK-based software development company that specializes in Mobile App Development, AI Services, CRM Development, UI/UX Design, and Product Development.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Vibe Coding with Copilot and Gemini 2.5 pro: Simplifying My Blog with AI-Assisted Refactoring</title><link>https://dev.to/debs_obrien/vibe-coding-with-copilot-and-gemini-25-pro-simplifying-my-blog-with-ai-assisted-refactoring-3033</link><author>Debbie O&apos;Brien</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 16:31:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I have been wanting to share more content on my blog, but ironically, the process of publishing has been slowing me down.One of the biggest points of friction was managing images. Whether I was searching for the right visuals, generating AI images, or uploading and optimizing them, the effort added more overhead than value. In a recent vibe coding session, I decided to remove images from the blog entirely and explore a content-first approach instead.To streamline the changes, I brought in some AI assistance with Copilot in VS Code and Gemini 2.5 Pro.
  
  
  Using AI for Real-World Development Tasks
This was not just an experiment in AI usage. It was an exploration of how well a coding assistant could help with a live production codebase. I had a few goals for the session:Remove images from the homepage and blog post layoutsAdjust the featured post section to work well without imagesAllow multiple featured posts to improve the layoutMaintain passing tests and catch any regressionsCopilot handled most of the layout changes with confidence. There were some hiccups, such as accidentally removing unrelated components, but thanks to having tests in place, I was able to identify those quickly and guide the AI to restore the correct content.
  
  
  The Role of Tests When Pairing with AI
This session was a good reminder that test coverage is essential when collaborating with an AI tool. It is easy for an assistant to refactor or delete something that seems unused, only to discover later that it was important for functionality.I spent some time updating my locators to be more dynamic rather than tied to specific static text. That small change helped the tests remain reliable and more resilient to future changes.
  
  
  Watch the Full Coding Session
If you are curious about how Gemini 2.5 pro performed, you can watch the full coding session on YouTube. You will see the back-and-forth of using an AI assistant to remove image dependencies, refactor layouts, restore unintended changes, and iterate toward a cleaner and simpler blog experience.Watch here:

It is not perfect, but it is a powerful partner when combined with tests and a clear workflow.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The AI Scene: Meta vs. OpenAI and the Increasing Talent Rivalry</title><link>https://dev.to/grenishrai/the-ai-scene-meta-vs-openai-and-the-increasing-talent-rivalry-2hnf</link><author>Grenish rai</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 16:22:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Artificial intelligence (AI) is a battle of capital, talent, and innovation, with OpenAI and Meta Platforms at the center. These technology leaders, sharing a common aim of developing sophisticated AI, embrace diametrically opposite approaches that define their paths and the industry as a whole. While Meta commits to open-sourced Llama models, OpenAI bets on its GPT series of closed-off offerings, their methods for developing AI, selling it, and attracting talent exposing them to different ideas about the future. This post examines their strategic divergence, the deepening AI talent war, and the trend's implications for the industry's future.
  
  
  Meta’s Journey: From FAIR to Llama’s Open-Source Ecosystem
Meta's AI journey started with the founding of its Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) division in 2015, directed by Yann LeCun. It started as a unit dedicated to basic research in domains such as object detection and self-supervised learning, but it has since shifted towards applying AI to its massive consumer platforms-Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and more. The Llama series, such as Llama 3 and the multimodal Llama 4, reflects Meta's open-source ethos, creating a developer community that fuels creativity and respects privacy through on-premise deployment. Strategic initiatives, such as a $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI to annotate data and establish dedicated AI Products and AGI Foundations teams, demonstrate Meta's haste to fill an imaginary gap between consumer AI adoption and further improve user experiences through capabilities such as AI-created content and integration with smart glasses.
  
  
  OpenAI’s Evolution: From Non-Profit to AGI Pioneer
Established in 2015 by entrepreneurs such as Sam Altman and Elon Musk, OpenAI began as a non-profit organization committed to safe and helpful Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Its 2019 conversion to a "capped" for-profit structure was a realistic approach to the staggering expense of AI research, allowing for enormous investments, including $10 billion from Microsoft. OpenAI’s GPT series, from GPT-1 to the multimodal GPT-4, has set benchmarks in natural language processing, while ChatGPT’s meteoric rise-reaching 100 million users in two months—redefined consumer AI. Initiatives like ChatGPT Enterprise and OpenAI for Government underscore its focus on high-value clients, funding its AGI mission through proprietary, high-performance models.
  
  
  Divergent Strategies: Open-Source vs. Proprietary
Meta’s open-source Llama models prioritize customization, privacy, and cost-efficiency, appealing to enterprises and developers needing on-premise solutions. However, critics argue Meta’s “open-source” label is misleading due to undocumented training data. In contrast, OpenAI’s proprietary GPT models deliver state-of-the-art performance and enterprise-grade support but at higher costs and with less transparency, catering to those seeking plug-and-play solutions. This divide-control versus performance-segments the AI market, with Meta fostering decentralized innovation and OpenAI leading in centralized, high-performance services.
  
  
  Commercialization and Market Positioning
Meta integrates AI into its social media and VR platforms, enhancing user engagement through personalized content and advertising tools. This defensive strategy counters the “existential threat” of AI companions diverting users from its platforms. OpenAI, however, adopts an API-first approach, targeting enterprises and government clients with solutions like ChatGPT Enterprise. Its $300 billion valuation in 2025 reflects the success of this model, balancing commercial growth with its AGI mission.Meta weighs basic research against product-driven AI, giving more weight to ad and consumer-facing generative capabilities than to efforts like its Behemoth model at times. OpenAI is laser-beam focused on AGI, giving more importance to safety and ethical advancement through efforts like the superalignment endeavor. These are in line with their business models: Meta, a publicly traded corporation, needs to grow on existing platforms, while OpenAI, with its capped-profit model, is willing to invest in long-term breakthroughs.
  
  
  The AI Talent War: Meta’s $100 Million Gambit
The scarcity of high AI talent-fewer than 1,000 researchers globally who can develop frontier models—has fueled a vicious talent battle. Meta's reported $100 million signing bonuses to poach OpenAI employees highlight the urgency to fill the consumer AI gap. These bonuses, as well as Meta's $14.3 billion acquisition of Scale AI, are designed to fuel innovation and secure talent for the development of superintelligence. However, OpenAI's retention achievement in the wake of such lavish bonuses speaks to the power of its mission-driven culture. Employees prioritize groundbreaking work and access to world-class resources over financial reward, illustrating that purpose and impact overpower even sky-high bonuses.
  
  
  Implications for the AI Landscape
The Meta-OpenAI duopoly encompasses the multi-dimensional dynamics of AI rivalry. Meta's open-source approach democratises but is faulted for lack of transparency, whereas OpenAI's proprietary approach optimises performance but sacrifices access. The talent war, driven by the scarcity of great researchers, exposes human capital as the ultimate chokepoint. With both companies lacking resources—compute power, data, and talent—their moves will shape the future of AI, balancing short-term market compulsions and long-term AGI aspirations.In this dynamic setting, the convergence of open-source and proprietary models and the talent war assures a rich, competitive AI ecosystem. Meta and OpenAI's different paths offer businesses and developers different solutions, fueling innovation and emphasizing mission, culture, and resources in creating AI leadership.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>JL Bluetooth Speaker Chip Classification: Entry-Level 706, Mid-Range 701, High-End Auracast &amp; Lavalier Mic Guide</title><link>https://dev.to/ble_voice/jl-bluetooth-speaker-chip-classification-entry-level-706-mid-range-701-high-end-auracast--119m</link><author>Junluan Tsui</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 15:57:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

The difference between early detection and delayed diagnosis can define the course of a patient’s life. For decades, oncologists and radiologists have relied on experience, training, and technology to catch cancer before it spreads. But today, something new has joined the fight: AI is not just another tool. It is a new kind of intelligence — one that doesn’t sleep, doesn’t tire, and doesn’t overlook the faintest of signals. From pattern recognition in radiology to genomic data analysis and predictive modeling, AI is reshaping the landscape of cancer diagnostics with unprecedented accuracy and speed.Reading the Unreadable: AI in ImagingMedical imaging — MRI, CT, mammograms — has long been one of the first lines of defense in cancer detection. But human radiologists, no matter how skilled, are still human. Studies have shown that even experienced professionals can miss subtle indicators of tumors, especially in high-volume, high-stress environments.Trained on thousands or even millions of anonymized scans, deep learning models can now detect cancerous lesions with accuracy rivaling — and in some cases exceeding — human experts. For example, Google Health’s breast cancer AI model reduced false positives and false negatives in clinical tests compared to radiologists(McKinney et al., Nature, 2020). The model not only recognized patterns invisible to most eyes but could even forecast the likelihood of cancer developing in the near future.This is not replacement — it’s augmentation. AI is becoming the second set of eyes every physician deserves.Cancer in the Code: AI and GenomicsAI also thrives in the deep world of . By parsing the vast complexity of DNA sequences, AI models can detect mutations associated with specific cancer types, suggest targeted treatments, and even predict how a tumor may evolve or resist therapy.This is the realm of  — treating not just the cancer, but the unique biological context of the individual. Companies like Tempus and IBM Watson for Genomics are leading the charge, using AI to match patients with the most effective therapies based on their genetic profiles.What once took weeks now takes hours.Predicting, Not Just DetectingBeyond detection, AI is now helping , relapse probabilities, and treatment responses. With real-time data from wearables, blood tests, and EHRs (electronic health records), models can forecast everything from tumor recurrence to pain levels.This isn't just data crunching — it’s  It gives doctors more than knowledge — it gives them lead time.Ethics, Equity, and EmpathyEvery revolution comes with responsibility. AI systems must be trained on diverse, inclusive datasets to avoid bias — especially for underrepresented populations in medical research.And most importantly: AI cannot replace the doctor-patient relationship. A model may detect cancer, but it cannot hold a hand, calm a heart, or explain what happens next with hope.The future of medicine is not human  machine. machine.Cancer has long been one of humanity’s fiercest enemies. But with AI’s help, we are learning to see earlier, act faster, and treat smarter.The diagnostic oracle has awakened — not to replace our healers, but to stand beside them, quietly watching for what we might miss.And in that silence, there is a new kind of compassion:

I Tested It</title><link>https://dev.to/lazic/can-ai-really-cut-development-time-by-90-i-tested-it-d2</link><author>Mladen</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 15:07:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The potential of AI to transform software development is undeniable, but what happens when you actually put it to the test? I decided to run a focused internal experiment using Claude 3.5 Sonnet embedded within the Windsurf IDE to build a small internal application, Scopic People.  The goal wasn’t to create a production-ready system, but to understand how AI could assist real developers under real constraints: limited time, basic requirements, and a constrained scope.  I also wanted to explore how prompting strategies, tooling setup, and task structure impacted development output and productivity. The result? A ~90% reduction in development time compared to a traditional estimate of 80–100 hours of development time plus overhead. In this post, I will walk you through the exact setup, the tools I used, how I structured the experiment, and the takeaways that shaped my conclusions. Tools I Used: Claude 3.5 Sonnet + Windsurf To explore how AI could accelerate development, I paired Claude 3.5 Sonnet with Windsurf, a conversational IDE designed for prompt-based workflows. I used Claude 3.5 Sonnet to generate code for frontend components, backend logic, authentication, and data integration. The model showed strong performance on structured tasks but was highly dependent on prompt clarity. Broad or vague instructions often led to inefficiencies or looping behavior. Windsurf served as the development environment, enabling inline prompting and output management directly in the codebase. The platform supported structured workflows, allowed quick iterations, and minimized context switching - key factors in our time savings. I approached the project as a greenfield build - starting from scratch with no existing code. The tool was developed in vanilla PHP with no frameworks, using Windsurf and Claude 3.5 Sonnet exclusively. My process was structured around iterative prompting: Tasks were broken into small steps. Natural language instructions were entered via Windsurf’s Cascade interface. AI-generated code was reviewed and either accepted or refined. Every accepted change was committed to Git, enabling version control and easy rollback. This cycle continued until the entire tool was completed, including authentication, UI, role-based access, caching, and database containerization. The Results: Time, Output, and Intervention After completing the development of Scopic People, I compared the results against traditional benchmarks to evaluate whether the AI-assisted workflow delivered real value.  I looked at 3 key areas: how much time was saved, the quality of the output, and where human developers still had to step in. The traditional estimate for building Scopic People was 80–100 development hours, plus 80% overhead for planning, QA, and leadership - totaling approximately 144–180 hours. Using Claude 3.5 and Windsurf, I completed the same scope in just 9 hours. That’s a ~90% reduction in development time, and an estimated 75–80% overall productivity gain when factoring in reduced overhead. Additionally, within the same amount of time I managed to add things beyond the original specs - such as database-driven admin access instead of hardcoded roles. Code Quality & Final Output Despite the time savings, code quality remained strong. The AI-produced code: Met all defined requirements Followed logical structure and good abstraction Was readable, functional, and extensible Where I Still Had to Step In While the AI generated most of the code, human oversight was essential.   I  intervened to: Break complex tasks into smaller prompts Refine instructions when Claude entered repetition loops Manually explore the Zoho People API and provide endpoint info for integration Decide when to skip AI prompts and implement small changes manually The most efficient approach proved to be a hybrid one: letting AI handle structure, boilerplate, and logic - but stepping in for fine-tuning or domain-specific decisions. Yes - under the right conditions. Claude 3.5 Sonnet significantly accelerated development, but only when used with clear, structured prompts and frequent review. Success wasn’t about letting AI take over - it was about how I worked with it. Vague instructions led to confusion or looping Specific, step-by-step prompts yielded fast, accurate output Direct manual edits were sometimes faster for small tweaks Used properly, AI was not a replacement - but a powerful collaborator that amplified developer productivity. Conclusion: What I’d Recommend to Other Teams This experiment wasn’t meant to replace traditional development. It was a proof of concept for how AI tools can streamline workflows when used thoughtfully. Key takeaways from the experiment: Break work into discrete tasks – large prompts overwhelm LLMs Review each iteration – catch issues early Use version control – recover easily from errors Don’t force AI into every decision – edit manually where faster Choose the right tools – Windsurf + Claude 3.5 made prompting seamless For teams testing AI in development, start with contained, well-scoped projects. The biggest gains came not from raw AI output, but from structured workflows that paired AI capabilities with human judgment. See what actually worked (and what didn’t) when I used AI to build a real app - prompts, time savings, tools, and all. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[Boost]</title><link>https://dev.to/rakeshv675/-1hi2</link><author>rakeshv675</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 14:54:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[10 best open source ChatGPT alternative that runs 100% locally]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Credibility Without a Human: How AI Fakes Authority and Why It Works</title><link>https://dev.to/agustn_startari_0c8417a8/credibility-without-a-human-how-ai-fakes-authority-and-why-it-works-43ol</link><author>Agustín Startari</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 14:53:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[_“It is advised that this be followed.”
_Looks professional. Sounds expert. But who says so?
A physician? A judge? A professor?
No one. Just a statistically plausible machine-generated sentence.**Welcome to the Age of Structural Credibility
**We are entering a phase in AI evolution where machines no longer need facts—or authorship—to be trusted.
What they need is structure. A tone. A rhythm. A certain pattern of words.
And suddenly, they sound right.
This phenomenon is not incidental. It is not a bug. It’s not even malicious.
It’s by design.**Enter: Synthetic Ethos
**This article introduces a concept called synthetic ethos—a form of perceived credibility generated not by knowledge, truth, or authority, but by grammatical patterns that mimic expert speech.Unlike traditional ethos (Aristotle’s term for personal credibility), synthetic ethos has:No epistemic accountabilityIt’s credibility without a subject—a linguistic illusion optimized by large language models (LLMs).**What the Research Shows
**We analyzed 1,500 AI-generated outputs from GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini in three critical domains:Healthcare: e.g., medical diagnostics, clinical explanationsLaw: e.g., case summaries, regulatory interpretationsEducation: e.g., student essays, academic promptsWe found repeating linguistic structures that reliably simulate authority:Passive voice (“It is recommended…”)Deontic modality (“must”, “should”, “ought”)Nominalization (turning verbs into abstract nouns: “implementation”, “enforcement”)Technical jargon with no citationAssertive tone without any referential groundingThese patterns activate trust heuristics in human readers—even though there’s no author, no context, and no origin.The Risk: Epistemic Misalignment
Imagine a patient entering symptoms into an app powered by LLMs and getting a medical explanation.
Or a student copying a generated answer into an assignment.
Or a legal assistant using a case summary with no source references.
In all these cases, the form of the output appears credible.
But the substance is unverifiable.
This is what we define as epistemic misalignment:
The structure of the message signals trust—but no actual source can be traced.**A Structural Model for Detection
**This article doesn’t stop at diagnosis. It proposes a falsifiable framework to detect synthetic ethos in AI-generated texts: Using LIWC and pattern classifiers to detect density of authoritative phrasing Mapping outputs by syntactic signature (e.g., Prescriptive–Opaque, Scholarly–Non-cited) Identifying signals like assertive modality, citation absence, and impersonalityIt also introduces a pipeline for synthetic ethos detection (see Anexo D) and compares existing regulatory blind spots in the EU AI Act and U.S. Algorithmic Accountability proposals.**What’s Different About This Paper?
**Unlike prior literature that critiques bias, hallucinations, or factual inconsistency in LLMs, this paper:Focuses on form, not contentTreats credibility as a grammatical artifact, not a truth-valueDefines a structural concept (synthetic ethos) that operates without agencyIt’s a linguistic theory of machine legitimacy—grounded in syntax, operationalized by computation, and made visible by structural patterning.

Running faster in this game isn't just about tapping keys like a maniac. It’s all about mastering timing, rhythm, and stamina. Let’s dive into how to run faster in Speed Stars and leave the others in the dust.
Master Your Rhythm
First things first—forget the idea of just slamming the buttons to speed up. You can’t reach your maximum speed by just mashing keys. Instead, focus on finding a smooth rhythm and sticking to it. If you press the keys too hard or too fast, you’re going to mess up your flow, which will slow you down. It's all about steady timing! Leaning forward by holding keys too long will also decelerate you, so keep that in mind when figuring out how to run faster in Speed Stars.
Save Stamina for the Finish
Long-distance races aren’t about going all out from the get-go. If you want to finish strong, you need to pace yourself. Conserve your energy early on and unleash that burst of speed when it counts. Knowing when to conserve and when to burn energy is a huge part of how to run faster in Speed Stars. Sprint early, and you’ll likely burn out before you hit the finish line!
Practice, Practice, and Practice
There’s no shortcut here—practice makes perfect! Experiment with different race lengths to find your rhythm for each type of sprint. The more you practice, the better your reaction times will get, and the faster you’ll be able to adapt to the game’s mechanics. Try out Free Run mode to get comfortable with the controls and gameplay, and before you know it, you'll be cruising through every race. Remember, the more you practice, the more you’ll improve, and that’s how to run faster in Speed Stars!Visit: speed-stars.pro for more detail info.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Every Developer Should Try Self-Hosting</title><link>https://dev.to/kedster/why-every-developer-should-try-self-hosting-2acp</link><author>Seth Keddy</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 14:14:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["If you can build it, you can host it."Self-hosting has quietly become a power move for developers who want more control, privacy, and resilience in their workflows.

The palpable excitement surrounding recent milestones, such as Neuralink's first human implantation in 2024, underscores this rapid advancement. These breakthroughs promise unprecedented possibilities for restoring function, enhancing human capabilities, and revolutionizing healthcare. Yet, as BCIs move closer to widespread adoption, the intricate ethical terrain they traverse becomes increasingly critical, demanding a robust ethical compass to ensure this transformative technology serves humanity responsibly.
  
  
  Privacy of Thought & Neural Data Security
One of the most profound ethical dilemmas posed by BCIs is the unprecedented access they offer to the brain's inner workings. What constitutes "brain data," and how can this intensely personal information be protected? BCIs can gather insights into a person's innermost thoughts, emotional states, and mental health. This sensitive data, if mishandled or exploited, presents significant risks. The potential for unauthorized access, misuse, or commercial exploitation is a serious concern. Imagine a scenario where brain data could be used against an individual in a job interview or for targeted manipulation.The risk of BCI systems being hacked and controlled by malicious actors is also amplified by wireless communication. Such breaches could lead to the extraction of private information or even manipulation of the device to harm the user. While existing laws like HIPAA and GDPR offer some privacy safeguards, their sufficiency in addressing the unique volume and sensitivity of BCI-generated data is debatable, necessitating updated legal frameworks. Proactive measures are already emerging, with states like Colorado introducing specific privacy regulations on commercial neurotechnology devices, setting a precedent for future legislation.
  
  
  Cognitive Liberty & Autonomy
Beyond data privacy, BCIs raise fundamental questions about cognitive liberty – the right to mental privacy and freedom of thought – and personal autonomy. Could direct brain interfaces subtly alter personality, influence decision-making, or even coerce actions without the user's full awareness? The very essence of personal identity and agency could be impacted. As the technology allows for deeper integration between minds and external devices, the line between one's own thoughts and externally influenced impulses could blur, prompting the urgent need to define and protect "neuro-rights."
  
  
  Equity, Access, and the Digital Divide
As with many advanced medical technologies, there is a significant concern that sophisticated BCI solutions might only be accessible to a privileged few. This could exacerbate existing societal inequalities, creating a new "digital divide" in healthcare and beyond. If BCIs offer significant advantages in communication, mobility, or cognitive function, limiting access could deepen disparities between those who can afford them and those who cannot. Ensuring equitable access and affordability must be a central tenet of BCI development and deployment to prevent the creation of a neuro-elite.
  
  
  Misuse and Dual-Use Potential
The transformative power of BCIs also carries the inherent risk of misuse and dual-use potential. While initially developed for therapeutic purposes, the technology could be diverted for non-therapeutic applications such as enhanced surveillance, psychological manipulation, or even military applications. Reports suggest that some governments are exploring BCI advancements for cognitive enhancement within their populations, highlighting the urgency of establishing robust safeguards and international norms to prevent such concerning uses. The ethical compass must guide development away from applications that could infringe on human rights or be weaponized.
  
  
  Responsibility and Accountability
The question of responsibility and accountability becomes particularly complex when BCI-controlled actions lead to unintended consequences. If a BCI enables a paralyzed individual to control a robotic arm, and that arm causes harm, who is liable? Is it the user, the BCI manufacturer, the software developer, or the medical professional who implanted the device? Clear legal and ethical frameworks are needed to delineate responsibility in this emerging human-machine interaction, ensuring that accountability is established and victims of unintended outcomes are protected.
  
  
  Regulatory and Ethical Frameworks in Development
Recognizing these profound challenges, governments, regulatory bodies, and international organizations are proactively working to establish guidelines and "neuro-rights" to govern BCI development and deployment. In the United States, the FDA's Total Product Life Cycle Advisory Program (TAP), expanded to include neurological and physical medicine devices, signifies a collaborative approach to expedite safe and effective medical device development while maintaining rigorous standards. This shift towards strategic partnerships between regulators and innovators aims to accelerate progress while prioritizing patient safety. Globally, discussions are emerging around "neuro-rights," with countries like China establishing ethical criteria for BCI research, reflecting a growing international focus on the moral implications of merging human minds with machines. These efforts are crucial for building public trust and ensuring the responsible integration of BCIs into society.
  
  
  Industry's Role and Best Practices
The BCI industry itself bears a significant responsibility in navigating this ethical landscape. It is imperative for companies to embed ethical considerations into every stage of their research, development, and commercialization strategies. This includes prioritizing transparency with users, obtaining genuine informed consent, and committing to long-term safety and efficacy studies. Companies like Synchron and Motif Neurotech are exploring less invasive approaches, demonstrating a conscious effort to minimize risks. The industry must move beyond a "move fast and break things" mentality, especially when dealing with the human brain, and instead embrace a patient, prudent approach guided by ethical principles. For a deeper dive into the future trajectory of this technology and the ethical considerations shaping it, explore discussions on the future of brain-computer interfaces.
  
  
  Future Outlook and Call to Action
The journey of Brain-Computer Interfaces is still in its early stages, but its trajectory promises to redefine human potential. Proactive ethical deliberation is not a hindrance to innovation but a foundational element for the sustainable, equitable, and beneficial integration of BCIs into society. As these technologies become more prevalent, the societal dialogue around neuroethics must continue and expand. Engaging in this conversation – as innovators, regulators, ethicists, and the public – is crucial to ensure that the ethical compass consistently guides BCIs towards a future that truly serves humanity's best interests.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Data Science, No Degree</title><link>https://www.kdnuggets.com/data-science-no-degree</link><author>Nisha Arya</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><enclosure url="https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/nisha-data-science-journey-1.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 14:00:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.kdnuggets.com/">KDNuggets blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An honest breakdown of the ups and downs I went through to get into the tech industry and top tips to learn from my mistakes.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🐦🐰 I Built Two Games in 4 Hours Using Amazon Q CLI !</title><link>https://dev.to/disha_t/i-built-two-games-in-4-hours-using-amazon-q-cli--24lm</link><author>Disha T</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 13:51:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
  
  
  🎮 One Prompt, Two Games: My Game Dev Sprint with Amazon Q CLI & Pygame
during the vacation time I set out on a spontaneous game development sprint—and it turned out to be one of the most productive Four hours I've ever spent building something. Thanks to , I didn’t just create one, but two fully working mini-games:☕ A time-management café simulator called It was fast, fun, and surprisingly smooth, especially with the help of Amazon Q CLI doing a lot of the heavy lifting in the background.
  
  
  🐤 First Game: Flappy Bird in One Prompt
To test Amazon Q CLI, I started with a basic prompt:make a simple flappy bird game using pygame
And just like that, it generated:Gravity-based bird movement Pipes that scroll across the screen With only minor tweaks to visuals and restart behavior, the game was fully playable.
  
  
  🐰☕ Second Game: Bunny Café – A Time Management Game
After finishing my Flappy Bird game , I decided to push things a bit further. My next idea was a  with a cute twist: a bunny café where bunnies serve  to animal customers.This required more complexity:Customer queueing and order trackingTimer for customer patiencePoints for correct orders
  
  
  🐣 Phase 1: The No-Asset Prototype
To kick things off, I used a basic prompt like before :Create a pygame food service game where a bunny serves cake and coffee to animal customers. Include timers and point system.
Q created a game window with basic rectangles for the bunny, coffee, and cake . Mouse-click based interaction to serve items, point system, Countdown timer and Randomly generated orders.
  
  
  🎨 Phase 2: Adding Custom Assets
Once I was happy with the gameplay loop, it was time to add some assets—because what’s a bunny café without a BunnyAmazon Q CLI won’t draw your bunny for you (yet 😄), but once you have your images—like the bunny, coffee cup, cake, and background—it totally knows what to do with them. I just dropped my files into an assets/ folder, and Q handled the rest. It even updated the code to load and place them in the game. Super smooth.and after the Asset were added the result was something like this :For developers looking to speed up their workflow while exploring new ideas, I highly recommend trying out Amazon Q CLI. Whether you're building games, experimenting with prototypes, or just learning the ropes, having an AI-powered assistant right in your terminal can make the whole process faster, smoother, and way more fun.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[Boost]</title><link>https://dev.to/sginsbourg/-2hok</link><author>Shay Ginsbourg</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 13:36:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Letting Playwright MCP Explore your site and Write your Tests]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Beyond Diagnostics: The Strategic Shift Towards Hyper-Personalized Healthcare with AI</title><link>https://dev.to/ahmed_salman_noor/beyond-diagnostics-the-strategic-shift-towards-hyper-personalizedhealthcare-with-ai-4ch2</link><author>Ahmed Salman Noor</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 13:31:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[🧬 AI will soon know your body better than your doctor.

Rather than forcing developers to manually assemble collections of tools for common use cases, Neuron introduces toolkits as an abstraction layer that transforms how we think about agent capability composition.The traditional approach requires instantiating each tool individually. Imagine you want to build agents that need mathematical reasoning – addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation tools must all be declared separately in the agent’s tool configuration. This granular approach quickly becomes unwieldy when agents require comprehensive functionality sets.Toolkits represent Neuron's solution to this complexity, packaging tools created around the same scope into a single, coherent interface that can be attached to any agent with a single line of code.Here is an example of the :The  base class establishes a consistent interface that all toolkits inherit, ensuring predictable behavior across the framework.The  method provides contextual information that helps the underlying language model understand not just what tools are available, but how they should be used together. In the case of the CalculatorToolkit, the guidelines explicitly suggest that complex mathematical expressions can be solved through step-by-step operations, guiding the agent toward effective problem-solving strategies.The  method returns the array of tools included in the toolkit by default. When a toolkit is attached to an agent, the individual tools become available exactly as if they had been added separately, but without the cognitive overhead of managing multiple tool declarations. Here is how you can add it to your agent:This approach maintains consistency with individual tool usage while providing the organizational benefits of grouped functionalities.If you want to learn from a practical implementation read the article below about creating a Data Analyst Agent with the :One of the most powerful aspects of Neuron's toolkit system is the selective exclusion capability. During development of complex agents, I’ve frequently encountered scenarios where a toolkit provides mostly the right functionality but includes tools that could lead to undesired behavior in specific contexts. The  method addresses this challenge elegantly, allowing developers to exclude a subset of tools from the toolkit. This becomes particularly useful when working with specialized agents that require limited capabilities, so you can reduce the probability of an agent to make mistakes, and why not reduce tokens consumption.The exclusion mechanism operates at the class level, using fully qualified class names to identify tools for removal. This selective approach eliminates the need to create custom toolkit variations for every possible combination of required tools.
  
  
  Extensibility & Ecosystem Opportunity
From an extensibility perspective, the toolkit system opens remarkable opportunities for community contribution and ecosystem growth. The consistent interface means that third-party developers can create domain-specific toolkits that integrate seamlessly with Neuron’s architecture. A developer building agents for financial applications might create a FinancialToolkit that includes tools for currency conversion, interest calculation, and risk assessment. Similarly, a WebScrapingToolkit could package HTTP request tools, HTML parsing capabilities, and data extraction utilities into a single, reusable component.The implications for development velocity are profound. In my experience building production agents with Neuron, the toolkit system reduces the cognitive load of capability management while maintaining the flexibility that professional development demands. Instead of researching and configuring multiple individual tools, developers can leverage pre-built, tested toolkit combinations that represent common functionality patterns. This approach accelerates the initial development phase while providing clear extension points for customization as requirements evolve.The toolkit architecture also promotes better code organization and maintainability. Related tools naturally cluster together in the same namespace, making it easier to understand an agent’s capabilities at a glance. When debugging or extending agent behavior, developers can reason about functionality at the toolkit level before diving into individual tool implementations.We know that production agents need reliable, well-tested combinations of capabilities rather than just single tools. By providing both the flexibility of individual tools and the convenience of pre-assembled toolkits, Neuron accommodates both rapid prototyping and sophisticated production deployments within a single, coherent architecture.The future potential of this system extends beyond current implementations. As the Neuron ecosystem grows, community-contributed toolkits could emerge as specialized capability libraries, much like how package ecosystems have evolved in other domains. A marketplace of verified, tested toolkits could dramatically accelerate agent development across industries, with each toolkit representing accumulated expertise in specific problem domains. This is our vision of NeuronAI as a platform for shared AI capability development, positioning PHP developers at the forefront of business-grade AI agent development.If you are getting started with AI Agents, or you simply want to elevate your skills to a new level here is a list of resources to help you go in the right direction:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Top 5 AI builder models for healthcare Apps Built in Power Apps</title><link>https://dev.to/megamindstech03/top-5-ai-builder-models-for-healthcare-apps-built-in-power-apps-a84</link><author>MegaMindsTech03</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 12:58:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A huge digital disruption is going on within the healthcare industry in 2025, being driven by the need for efficiency, accuracy, and maximum patient outcomes.

  Flutter and GraphQL: Building Smarter, More Efficient Mobile Apps
In the dynamic world of mobile development, efficiency, data management, and developer experience are paramount. Flutter, with its declarative UI and cross-platform capabilities, has rapidly ascended as a leading framework for building beautiful and performant applications. Complementing this powerful frontend is GraphQL, a query language for APIs that revolutionizes how clients fetch data. Together, Flutter and GraphQL form a potent combination, enabling developers to build smarter, more efficient, and more delightful mobile experiences.For too long, mobile developers have grappled with the limitations of traditional REST APIs. Over-fetching and under-fetching of data, repetitive requests, and complex versioning strategies have often led to slower app performance and increased development overhead. GraphQL elegantly addresses these pain points by empowering clients to specify precisely the data they need, nothing more, nothing less. This granular control, combined with Flutter's ability to efficiently render and manage complex UIs, creates a synergistic development environment.
  
  
  The GraphQL Advantage for Flutter
At its core, GraphQL is a query language for APIs, but it's more than just syntax. It's a paradigm shift in how we interact with data. Here's why it's such a compelling companion for Flutter: Imagine a Flutter screen that needs to display a user's profile picture, name, and a list of their recent posts. With REST, you might need multiple API calls: one for the user's basic info, another for their posts. GraphQL allows you to craft a single query that fetches all this data in one go. This significantly reduces network round trips, leading to faster load times and a smoother user experience, especially on mobile networks.Reduced Over-fetching and Under-fetching: Over-fetching occurs when an API returns more data than the client needs, wasting bandwidth and processing power. Under-fetching requires multiple requests to gather all necessary data. GraphQL's "ask for what you need" principle eliminates both these issues. Your Flutter app only receives the exact fields it requests. GraphQL APIs are defined by a schema, a contract that describes all the data types, queries, mutations, and subscriptions available. This provides immense value for Flutter developers. Static analysis tools and code generators can leverage this schema to provide type safety, auto-completion, and compile-time error checking within your Flutter codebase. This significantly reduces runtime errors and speeds up the development process.Real-time Data with Subscriptions: For applications requiring real-time updates (e.g., chat applications, live scores, collaborative tools), GraphQL subscriptions are a game-changer. They allow clients to maintain a persistent connection with the server, receiving data updates as they happen. Flutter's reactive nature seamlessly integrates with this real-time data flow, enabling dynamic and responsive UIs.
  
  
  Integrating GraphQL with Flutter: Tools and Techniques
The Flutter ecosystem has embraced GraphQL with enthusiasm, offering a variety of excellent libraries and tools to facilitate integration. The most popular and robust solution is . provides a comprehensive set of widgets and utilities for connecting your Flutter app to a GraphQL API. It offers: This widget acts as the central point for your GraphQL client, making it accessible throughout your widget tree. A declarative widget that fetches data from your GraphQL API based on a provided query. It offers built-in loading, error, and data states, which can be easily rendered in your UI. Similar to , but for executing mutations (operations that modify data on the server). For handling real-time data updates.Let's look at a practical example of fetching data using :First, you'll need to add the dependency to your  file:Then, initialize your GraphQL client, typically in your  file or an application-level provider:Now, let's create a  that fetches user data:This example demonstrates how concisely you can fetch data and display it in your Flutter UI. The  widget handles the network request, loading states, and error handling, allowing you to focus on building the UI components.
  
  
  Advanced GraphQL Patterns with Flutter
Beyond basic data fetching, Flutter and GraphQL can be leveraged for more sophisticated patterns: For mutations that are likely to succeed, you can implement optimistic updates. This means updating the UI immediately as if the mutation was successful, before the server confirms. If the mutation fails, you can revert the UI.  provides tools to help manage these local state changes. integrates with , allowing you to implement various caching strategies (e.g., , ). This is crucial for performance, as it can avoid unnecessary network requests by serving data from the cache when available. For larger projects, consider using GraphQL code generation tools. These tools can generate Dart models and query/mutation/subscription classes directly from your GraphQL schema. This enhances type safety, reduces boilerplate code, and significantly improves developer productivity. Libraries like  and  are excellent choices.
  
  
  When to Choose Flutter and GraphQL
While this combination is powerful, it's important to consider when it's the best fit:Complex Data Requirements: If your app needs to fetch interconnected data from multiple sources or requires very specific data payloads, GraphQL shines.Rapid Prototyping and Iteration: The efficiency of data fetching and strong typing provided by GraphQL accelerates the development cycle, making it ideal for startups and projects with evolving requirements. If your application relies heavily on real-time data updates, GraphQL subscriptions are a natural fit.Performance Optimization: For apps where network efficiency is critical, especially on mobile, GraphQL's precise data fetching is a significant advantage.As the mobile landscape continues to evolve, the synergy between declarative UI frameworks like Flutter and intelligent API technologies like GraphQL will only become more pronounced. By embracing this powerful pairing, developers can build mobile applications that are not only visually stunning and performant but also incredibly efficient in their data management and responsive to real-time changes. Flutter and GraphQL are more than just tools; they represent a smarter way to build the future of mobile experiences.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Introducing OpenLLM Monitor: The Dev Tool for Reliable LLM Deployments</title><link>https://dev.to/prajeesh_chavan_1a68e0ff2/introducing-openllm-monitor-the-dev-tool-for-reliable-llm-deployments-kg2</link><author>Prajeesh Chavan</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 12:49:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Empowering developers to monitor, debug, and optimize Large Language Model (LLM) applications with ease.

  Beyond the Default: Unlocking the Power of AI for App Personalization
In today's hyper-connected world, users expect more than just functional applications. They crave experiences that feel tailor-made, anticipating their needs and preferences before they even articulate them. This is where AI for App Personalization steps in, transforming static applications into dynamic, intelligent companions. For developers and tech enthusiasts, understanding and implementing AI-powered personalization isn't just a competitive edge; it's becoming a fundamental requirement for user engagement and retention.Gone are the days of one-size-fits-all. Whether it's a streaming service recommending your next binge-watch, an e-commerce platform highlighting products you'll love, or a productivity tool organizing your workflow intuitively, AI is the invisible architect behind these seamless and satisfying user journeys. This article will delve into the core concepts, practical applications, and the exciting future of AI in app personalization, empowering you to build more engaging and effective digital experiences.
  
  
  Why Personalization Matters: The User-Centric Revolution
The benefits of effective app personalization are undeniable:Increased User Engagement: When an app understands and caters to individual needs, users are more likely to spend time within it, interact with its features, and return consistently. For e-commerce or service-based apps, personalized recommendations and offers directly translate to increased sales and conversions.Improved User Satisfaction: A feeling of being understood and catered to fosters loyalty and positive sentiment towards the app. By providing a consistently relevant experience, personalization helps combat user fatigue and the temptation to switch to a competitor. The data collected through personalization efforts provides invaluable insights into user behavior, which can inform future development and marketing strategies.
  
  
  The AI Toolkit for Personalization: Core Concepts and Techniques
At its heart, AI personalization relies on understanding and predicting user behavior. This is achieved through a variety of AI techniques:
  
  
  1. Machine Learning: The Engine of Prediction
Machine learning algorithms are the backbone of modern personalization. They learn from vast amounts of data to identify patterns and make predictions about future actions. This is a popular technique, famously used by Netflix. It works by identifying users with similar preferences and recommending items that those similar users have liked.User-Based Collaborative Filtering: "Users who liked X also liked Y."Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: "Users who bought this item also bought that item."Example (Conceptual Python Snippet): This method recommends items similar to those the user has liked in the past, based on item attributes (e.g., genre, keywords, tags). If a user enjoys action movies with a specific actor, content-based filtering would recommend other action movies featuring that actor or similar plot elements. Combining collaborative and content-based filtering often yields the best results, mitigating the weaknesses of each individual method (e.g., the "cold start" problem for new users or items). Neural networks, particularly Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers, are increasingly used for more sophisticated personalization, capturing complex sequential patterns in user behavior and understanding nuanced content representations.
  
  
  2. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Understanding User Intent
NLP enables apps to understand and process human language, crucial for personalizing interactions and content. Gauging user sentiment from reviews, feedback, or in-app messages to tailor responses or product suggestions.Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying key entities (people, places, products) in text to understand user interests and context. Discovering underlying themes in user-generated content to categorize interests and personalize content delivery.
  
  
  3. Reinforcement Learning (RL): Learning Through Trial and Error
RL algorithms learn by interacting with their environment (the app and the user) and receiving rewards or penalties based on their actions. This is excellent for optimizing sequences of interactions. An RL agent could learn to dynamically adjust the order of notifications or the layout of content based on which arrangements lead to higher user engagement and task completion.
  
  
  Practical Applications of AI Personalization Across App Categories
The impact of AI personalization can be seen in virtually every app category:
  
  
  1. E-commerce & Retail Apps:
 Suggesting items based on browsing history, purchase history, cart contents, and similar users' behavior.Personalized Pricing & Promotions: Offering targeted discounts or bundles based on loyalty, purchase patterns, and predicted responsiveness. Rearranging product listings, banners, and categories to highlight items most relevant to the individual user. Amazon's "Frequently bought together" and "Customers who viewed this item also viewed" sections are classic examples of collaborative filtering in action.
  
  
  2. Media & Entertainment Apps (Streaming, Music, News):
 Recommending movies, TV shows, music tracks, or news articles based on viewing/listening history, genre preferences, and mood.Personalized Playlists & Feeds: Curating dynamic playlists or news feeds that adapt to changing user interests.Notification Optimization: Sending personalized push notifications about new releases or trending content that the user is likely to engage with. Spotify's "Discover Weekly" playlist is a prime example of sophisticated AI-driven content recommendation.
  
  
  3. Productivity & Utility Apps:
Smart Task Prioritization: Reordering to-do lists or suggesting the next action based on user habits and deadlines.Personalized Interface Layouts: Adapting the app's UI to make frequently used features more accessible.Automated Workflow Suggestions: Proposing shortcuts or automations based on observed user workflows. Gmail's "Smart Reply" feature uses NLP to suggest contextually relevant responses to emails.
  
  
  4. Social Media & Communication Apps:
 Prioritizing posts and updates from friends, followed accounts, or topics of interest.Friend/Connection Suggestions: Recommending people to connect with based on mutual friends, shared interests, or location.Personalized Ad Targeting: Delivering advertisements that are most relevant to the user's inferred interests and demographics.
  
  
  5. Health & Fitness Apps:
Personalized Workout Plans: Creating dynamic exercise routines based on fitness levels, goals, and progress. Suggesting meal plans and recipes tailored to individual nutritional needs and preferences.Progress Tracking & Motivation: Providing personalized insights and motivational messages based on user data.
  
  
  Building Your Personalization Strategy: Key Considerations for Developers
Data is King (and Queen): Identify what data points are crucial for understanding your users (e.g., clicks, views, purchases, time spent, search queries, ratings). Clean, accurate, and well-structured data is essential for effective AI models. Always prioritize user privacy. Be transparent about data collection and obtain explicit consent. Comply with regulations like GDPR and CCPA.Choose the Right AI Model: For initial personalization, simpler algorithms like item-based collaborative filtering might suffice. As your data grows and user understanding deepens, explore more complex models like deep learning or hybrid approaches.Consider Computational Resources: Some advanced models require significant processing power. Implement mechanisms for users to rate content, provide feedback, or explicitly state preferences. Track user interactions (clicks, dwell time, skips) as indirect indicators of preference. Design your AI systems to continuously learn from new data and feedback, adapting to evolving user tastes.A/B Testing and Evaluation: Regularly A/B test different personalization strategies and algorithms to quantify their effectiveness. Track key performance indicators (KPIs) like conversion rates, engagement time, click-through rates, and retention.Technical Implementation:Leverage AI/ML Platforms: Utilize cloud-based AI services (AWS Personalize, Google Cloud AI Platform, Azure Machine Learning) or open-source libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn) to streamline development. Ensure your personalization infrastructure can scale to handle growing user bases and data volumes.
  
  
  The Future of AI Personalization: Hyper-Personalization and Beyond
The journey of AI personalization is far from over. We're moving towards , where every interaction, every piece of content, and every feature is tailored to the individual in real-time. This includes:Contextual Personalization: Adapting experiences based on the user's current situation, location, time of day, and even their emotional state.Proactive Personalization: Anticipating user needs and offering solutions before the user even realizes they have a need. Ensuring fairness, transparency, and accountability in personalization algorithms to avoid bias and discrimination.AI for app personalization is no longer a luxury; it's a necessity for building successful and enduring applications. By embracing AI-driven techniques, developers can move beyond generic experiences and craft deeply engaging, user-centric journeys that foster loyalty and drive growth. The ability to understand, predict, and adapt to individual user needs is the key to unlocking the full potential of your app in today's competitive digital landscape.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🧰 Top Developer Tools to Watch in 2025</title><link>https://dev.to/doc_e_ai/top-developer-tools-to-watch-in-2025-511n</link><author>Doc-e.ai</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 12:36:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the ever-evolving world of software development, staying up to date with the latest tools isn't just helpful—it's essential.

  Orchestrating User Journeys: The Power of AI-Powered Recommendation Systems
In today's hyper-connected digital landscape, users are bombarded with an overwhelming amount of information and choices. From streaming services suggesting their next binge-worthy series to e-commerce platforms curating personalized product assortments, the ability to cut through the noise and deliver relevant experiences is paramount. This is where the magic of AI-Powered Recommendation Systems truly shines, acting as intelligent guides that orchestrate user journeys and drive engagement.For developers and tech enthusiasts, understanding the mechanics and strategic implementation of these systems is no longer a niche skill but a core competency. These systems are the unsung heroes behind many successful digital platforms, transforming passive browsing into active discovery and fostering deeper user loyalty.
  
  
  Beyond "People Who Bought This Also Bought That": The Evolution of Recommendation Engines
Early recommendation systems often relied on simple, rule-based approaches or basic statistical methods. While effective in their time, these methods lacked the sophistication to capture nuanced user preferences and the ever-evolving nature of tastes. The advent of Artificial Intelligence, particularly advancements in machine learning and deep learning, has revolutionized this space, enabling the creation of far more intelligent and personalized experiences.At their core, AI-powered recommendation systems aim to predict what a user is likely to be interested in based on various data points. This data can be broadly categorized into two main types: Direct user input, such as ratings, reviews, likes, or dislikes. Inferred user preferences from their behavior, such as purchase history, browsing patterns, time spent on content, search queries, and even social media interactions.
  
  
  Pillars of AI-Powered Recommendation: Algorithms and Techniques
Several key AI-powered algorithms and techniques form the backbone of modern recommendation systems:
  
  
  1. Collaborative Filtering: The Power of the Crowd
Collaborative filtering is perhaps the most widely adopted approach. It operates on the principle that users who have agreed in the past will likely agree in the future. There are two primary flavors:User-Based Collaborative Filtering: This method identifies users with similar preferences to a target user and recommends items that these similar users have liked but the target user hasn't yet encountered. If User A likes movies X, Y, and Z, and User B likes movies X, Y, and W, then User A might be recommended movie W because User B, who is similar, enjoyed it.Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: This approach focuses on the similarity between items. If a user has liked a particular item, the system recommends other items that are similar to it, based on the behavior of other users. If many users who watched "The Matrix" also watched "Inception," then a user who watches "The Matrix" is likely to enjoy "Inception." Matrix factorization techniques, such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), are commonly used to implement collaborative filtering. These techniques decompose a user-item interaction matrix into lower-dimensional latent factor matrices, capturing underlying user preferences and item characteristics.Python Snippet (Conceptual using  library):
  
  
  2. Content-Based Filtering: The Power of Attributes
Content-based filtering recommends items similar to those a user has liked in the past, based on the attributes of the items themselves. This approach is particularly useful when there's limited user interaction data but rich item metadata. If a user enjoys science fiction movies with strong female protagonists, a content-based system would recommend other science fiction movies that also feature strong female leads, analyzing keywords, genres, directors, and actors. Techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) are used to represent item content as vectors. Cosine similarity is then employed to measure the similarity between these content vectors.Python Snippet (Conceptual using ):
  
  
  3. Hybrid Recommendation Systems: The Best of Both Worlds
Pure collaborative or content-based systems have their limitations. Hybrid approaches combine multiple recommendation techniques to leverage their strengths and mitigate their weaknesses, leading to more robust and accurate recommendations. The scores from different recommender systems are combined using weighted averages. The system switches between different recommenders based on certain conditions (e.g., data sparsity). Recommendations from different systems are presented together.Feature Combination Hybrid: Features from one system are used as input for another. A music streaming service might use collaborative filtering to identify users with similar listening habits and content-based filtering to analyze the genre, tempo, and mood of songs. A hybrid system could then combine these insights to recommend new artists or tracks that both match the user's known preferences and align with the characteristics of music they already enjoy.
  
  
  4. Deep Learning for Recommendations: Unlocking Deeper Patterns
Deep learning models, particularly those leveraging neural networks, have propelled recommendation systems to new heights.Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): Can learn complex, non-linear relationships between users, items, and contextual information. They can effectively model sequential data, such as browsing history, to capture temporal dependencies.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers: Excellent for sequence-aware recommendations, understanding the order in which users interact with items.Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Represent users and items as nodes in a graph, allowing for the modeling of complex relationships and interactions. Netflix's recommendation engine is known to utilize deep learning models to understand intricate patterns in viewing habits, device usage, and even time of day to offer highly personalized content suggestions. Models like Wide & Deep learning (combining linear models with deep neural networks) or factorization machines can effectively capture both memorization and generalization in recommendations.
  
  
  Practical Considerations for Developers
Building and deploying effective AI-powered recommendation systems involves several practical considerations:Data Collection and Preprocessing: High-quality, clean data is crucial. This involves handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data consistency. Feature engineering plays a vital role in extracting meaningful signals from raw data. Recommendation systems need to handle a massive number of users and items. Choosing appropriate algorithms and infrastructure is key. Distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark are often employed.Real-time vs. Batch Recommendations: Depending on the application, recommendations might need to be generated in real-time (e.g., for dynamic website content) or in batches (e.g., for daily email digests). This refers to the challenge of recommending items to new users or recommending new items that have little to no interaction data. Hybrid approaches and content-based filtering are often used to address this. Beyond accuracy, metrics like precision, recall, Mean Average Precision (MAP), and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) are essential for evaluating the effectiveness of recommendation systems. Continuously experimenting with different algorithms, parameters, and UI implementations through A/B testing is crucial for optimizing recommendation performance. While deep learning models can be powerful, understanding  a recommendation is made can be challenging. Techniques for explainable AI (XAI) are becoming increasingly important for building user trust.
  
  
  The Future of Recommendations: Personalization, Context, and Beyond
The field of AI-powered recommendation systems is constantly evolving. Future trends include:Context-Aware Recommendations: Incorporating real-time context such as location, time of day, device, and even current user mood.Reinforcement Learning for Recommendations: Using RL to learn optimal recommendation policies that maximize long-term user engagement.Explainable and Fair Recommendations: Developing systems that are not only accurate but also transparent and free from bias.Conversational Recommendations: Integrating recommendations into dialogue systems for a more interactive and intuitive experience.AI-powered recommendation systems are no longer a luxury; they are a necessity for any digital platform aiming to thrive in today's competitive landscape. By understanding the underlying algorithms, embracing advanced AI techniques, and thoughtfully addressing practical implementation challenges, developers and tech enthusiasts can harness the power of these systems to craft truly engaging and personalized user experiences, ultimately driving business success and fostering lasting user loyalty. The journey of a user through a digital world is increasingly being orchestrated by the intelligent hand of AI, and the possibilities are as vast as the data itself.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Flutter CI/CD: Automate &amp; Deploy Fast</title><link>https://dev.to/sushan_dristi_ab98c07ea8f/flutter-cicd-automate-deploy-fast-3e24</link><author>Sushan Dristi</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 12:30:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
  
  
  Streamlining Your Flutter Development: Building a Robust CI/CD Pipeline
In the fast-paced world of mobile development, delivering high-quality Flutter applications efficiently is paramount. For developers and tech enthusiasts alike, understanding and implementing a robust Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is no longer a luxury – it’s a necessity. This article will delve into the core concepts of Flutter CI/CD, explore its benefits, and guide you through building your own streamlined workflow, empowering you to release better apps, faster.
  
  
  What is CI/CD and Why Does it Matter for Flutter?
At its heart, CI/CD is a set of practices that automate the software development lifecycle.Continuous Integration (CI): This is the practice of frequently merging code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository. Each integration is then verified by an automated build and automated tests. The goal is to detect integration errors as early as possible, preventing "integration hell" and ensuring a stable codebase.Continuous Deployment (CD): This extends CI by automatically deploying all code changes that pass the automated tests to a production or staging environment. Continuous Delivery is a precursor where code is deployed to a staging environment but requires manual approval before going to production.For Flutter developers, CI/CD brings a multitude of benefits: Automating builds, testing, and deployments significantly reduces the time it takes to get new features and bug fixes into the hands of your users. Automated tests, from unit tests to integration tests, catch bugs early in the development process, leading to more stable and reliable applications. Automating repetitive tasks minimizes the risk of human error, ensuring consistency and accuracy in your build and deployment processes.Increased Developer Productivity: Developers can focus on writing code rather than managing complex build and deployment procedures, boosting overall productivity. A shared repository with automated checks fosters better collaboration among team members, as everyone is working with a verified and integrated codebase.
  
  
  The Building Blocks of a Flutter CI/CD Pipeline
A typical Flutter CI/CD pipeline can be broken down into several key stages:Source Code Management (SCM): This is where your Flutter project code resides. Popular choices include GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. A version control system is crucial for tracking changes, facilitating collaboration, and triggering pipeline events.Continuous Integration Server: This is the engine that orchestrates your pipeline. Popular CI/CD platforms include: Tightly integrated with GitHub, offering a flexible and powerful way to automate workflows. A robust solution built into GitLab, providing comprehensive features for CI/CD. A highly customizable and widely adopted open-source automation server, capable of handling complex pipelines. A mobile-focused CI/CD platform designed specifically for building, testing, and deploying mobile apps, including Flutter. This stage involves compiling your Flutter project for the target platforms (iOS, Android, web, desktop). This typically includes:  Fetching dependencies ()  Running code analysis ()  Building the release artifacts (APK for Android, IPA for iOS, etc.) This is where automated tests are executed to ensure the quality of your application. Key test types include: Test individual functions or classes in isolation. Test individual Flutter widgets. Test the interaction between different parts of your application or the application as a whole. Once the build and tests are successful, this stage involves deploying your application to various environments: For internal testing and quality assurance. Releasing to app stores (Google Play Store, Apple App Store) or other distribution channels.
  
  
  Practical Implementation: A GitHub Actions Example
Let’s illustrate how to set up a basic CI/CD pipeline for a Flutter project using GitHub Actions. This example will cover building and testing for Android.1. Create a Workflow File:In your Flutter project's root directory, create a  folder. Inside this folder, create a YAML file, for instance, .Explanation of the GitHub Actions Workflow:: Defines the name of your workflow.: This workflow will trigger on  events to the  branch and on  events targeting the  branch.: A workflow can contain one or more jobs. Here, we have a single job named .: Specifies the operating system environment for the job. For Android builds, Ubuntu is a common and suitable choice. For iOS, you would need to use .: A job is composed of a series of steps.

: This action checks out your repository's code so the workflow can access it.subosito/flutter-action@v2: This is a popular action that sets up the Flutter SDK in the runner environment. You specify the  and .: Fetches all project dependencies.: Runs static analysis to identify potential code issues.: Executes all unit and widget tests in your project.flutter build apk --release: Builds a release APK for Android. You can customize this command to build different variants or for different platforms.actions/upload-artifact@v3: This action allows you to upload files generated during the workflow. In this case, we're uploading the built APK. This is useful for manual inspection or further deployment.2. Triggering the Pipeline:Whenever you push code to the  branch or create a pull request targeting , GitHub Actions will automatically execute this workflow. You can monitor the progress and results on the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository.
  
  
  Expanding Your Pipeline: Beyond Basic Builds
The example above is a starting point. A comprehensive Flutter CI/CD pipeline can incorporate more advanced features: Integrate tools like  to generate code coverage reports, providing insights into the thoroughness of your tests. Beyond , use tools like  with custom linting rules to enforce coding standards. For more complex scenarios, consider end-to-end UI testing frameworks like  or .Continuous Delivery to Staging: Set up automated deployments to a staging environment (e.g., Firebase App Distribution, TestFlight for iOS) upon successful builds.Continuous Deployment to Production: For fully automated production releases, you'll need to integrate with app store deployment tools and handle release management carefully. This often involves manual approval steps for critical releases. Configure notifications (e.g., Slack, email) to alert your team about build failures or successes.Environment Variables and Secrets: Securely manage API keys, signing certificates, and other sensitive information using your CI/CD platform's secrets management features.
  
  
  Choosing the Right CI/CD Platform
The choice of CI/CD platform depends on your team's existing infrastructure, budget, and specific needs: Excellent for projects already hosted on GitHub, offering seamless integration and a generous free tier. A strong contender if your team uses GitLab for SCM, providing an all-in-one solution. Specifically tailored for mobile development, making it a great choice for Flutter projects, especially those with complex mobile-specific build requirements. Offers unparalleled flexibility and customization, but requires more setup and maintenance.
  
  
  Challenges and Best Practices
 Ensure your automated tests are stable and don't produce false positives or negatives. Flaky tests can undermine the confidence in your pipeline. Optimize your build process to keep build times manageable. Cache dependencies, use efficient build commands, and leverage parallel execution where possible.Platform-Specific Builds: Managing iOS and Android builds requires different environments and configurations. Consider using specialized macOS runners for iOS builds. Protect your CI/CD environment and sensitive data. Implement proper access controls and use secrets management tools. Clearly document your CI/CD pipeline, including the workflow files, setup instructions, and troubleshooting guides.A well-defined Flutter CI/CD pipeline is a powerful asset for any development team. By automating your build, test, and deployment processes, you can significantly accelerate your release cycles, improve code quality, and empower your developers to focus on what they do best: building amazing Flutter applications. Embrace CI/CD, and watch your development workflow transform.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Impact of AI on Organizations</title><link>https://dev.to/superpayments/the-impact-of-ai-on-organizations-2ci4</link><author>Aidan McGinley</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 12:30:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What if everything we believe about AI's impact on organizational structure is backward? The widespread assumption is that artificial intelligence will inevitably lead to smaller, leaner teams.  This is characterised by the pithy comment 'Do more with less'.  However that assumption may be fundamentally wrong. Here, I outline why the organizations that thrive in the AI era won't be those that downsize, but those that leverage AI to build and manage larger, more impactful teams than were previously possible.
  
  
  The Economics of Team Size
To understand how AI will impact optimal team size, we first need to understand what determines team size in the first place. In any organization, there are two key functions that determine the optimal number of employees: the cost function and the value function.Adding an employee incurs two types of costs:Fixed costs: These are straightforward - salary, benefits, equipment, office space, etc.Variable costs: These are subtler but often more significant. They stem from organizational complexity and are based on principles like Dunbar's number and the exponential growth of communication paths as teams expand.When you plot the marginal cost of hiring employee N, you get a hockey stick curve. Early on, fixed costs dominate, resulting in a relatively flat line. But as the team grows, variable costs take over, causing the curve to bend sharply upward. Anyone who has managed a rapidly growing team will recognize this pattern intuitively - it gets exponentially harder to add people past a certain point.On the value side, let's consider a simplified model of diminishing returns. While real organizations exhibit much more complex patterns, including potential network effects and complementarities between employees, a basic diminishing returns model can still offer useful insights. In this simplified view, your first hire delivers significant value, and each subsequent hire adds value, though typically at a decreasing rate. This creates a generally downward-sloping line when we plot the marginal value of employee N. While this is a significant simplification of organizational reality, it serves to illustrate our key points about AI's impact.The optimal team size occurs where these two curves intersect - the point where the marginal cost of adding another employee equals their marginal value contribution. Past this point, each new hire costs more than the value they bring.Now, here's where it gets interesting. AI doesn't just shift these curves - it fundamentally reshapes them. Let's examine how:The baseline value per employee increases as AI amplifies individual productivityThe diminishing returns effect may be moderated as AI tools support productivity at scaleAI can facilitate more effective employee specializationThis causes the value curve to move upwards indicating more value per employeeThe fixed cost component might increase slightly due to AI tool costsThe variable cost curve may become more manageable as AI helps with certain aspects of organizational complexitySome communication and coordination costs can be better handled with AI-powered toolsThese attributes lead to lower costs per employee causing the cost curve to move downwards or to the rightWhen you plot these new curves, the intersection point tends to move to the right. This suggests that the optimal team size for an AI-enabled organization could be larger than for a traditional one.This insight has profound implications for how we think about AI's impact on organizations:Instead of viewing AI as a replacement for human workers, we should see it as a catalyst for organizational scalingThe focus should be on how AI can help manage complexity and maintain productivity at scaleCompanies that understand this will gain competitive advantages by building larger, more capable teams that deliver more valueHere we've covered an economic model for describing how AI will affect organisations.  In the next post we will explore how these theoretical insights translate into practice by examining the impact on a software engineering team.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Flutter Apps: Build Smarter</title><link>https://dev.to/sushan_dristi_ab98c07ea8f/ai-flutter-apps-build-smarter-b0n</link><author>Sushan Dristi</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 12:04:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
  
  
  The Flutterverse Awakens: Unleashing the Power of AI in Your Cross-Platform Apps
The world of mobile development is in constant flux, and for cross-platform developers, Flutter has carved out a significant niche. Its declarative UI, rich ecosystem, and single codebase approach offer unparalleled efficiency. But what if we told you that Flutter is about to get a whole lot smarter? Enter Artificial Intelligence (AI) – the transformative force that's poised to revolutionize how we build and interact with Flutter applications.For developers and tech enthusiasts alike, the prospect of integrating AI into Flutter opens up a universe of possibilities. Imagine apps that learn user preferences, predict behavior, automate complex tasks, and offer truly personalized experiences. This isn't science fiction; it's the burgeoning reality of AI-powered Flutter applications.
  
  
  Why AI and Flutter: A Synergistic Partnership
Flutter's core strengths make it an ideal canvas for AI integration. Its reactive nature and efficient rendering engine are perfectly suited to handle the data-intensive computations often associated with AI models. Furthermore, Flutter's cross-platform capabilities mean that AI-powered features can be deployed seamlessly across Android, iOS, web, and even desktop, maximizing reach and impact.Think about it: instead of painstakingly building platform-specific AI features, you can leverage Flutter's single codebase to implement sophisticated AI functionalities that benefit all your users. This not only accelerates development but also ensures a consistent and high-quality user experience across devices.
  
  
  Diving into the AI Toolkit for Flutter Developers
So, how do we actually bring AI into our Flutter projects? The answer lies in a growing ecosystem of libraries, APIs, and frameworks that bridge the gap between Flutter's UI capabilities and the intelligence of AI.
  
  
  1. On-Device AI: Bringing Intelligence Closer to the User
For many applications, performing AI tasks directly on the device offers significant advantages in terms of latency, privacy, and offline functionality.TensorFlow Lite (TFLite): This is arguably the most popular and robust solution for on-device machine learning in Flutter. TFLite allows you to deploy TensorFlow models trained for mobile and edge devices. Flutter developers can integrate TFLite using packages like  or .Practical Example: Image ClassificationImagine a Flutter app that can identify objects in photos. Using TFLite, you can integrate a pre-trained image classification model (e.g., MobileNet) to perform this task.(Note: This is a simplified snippet. Real-world TFLite integration involves careful model loading, input tensor preparation, and output tensor interpretation based on the specific model used.) For tasks like text recognition, barcode scanning, face detection, and image labeling, ML Kit provides pre-built, on-device APIs. The  package offers seamless integration with Flutter.Practical Example: Text Recognition
  
  
  2. Cloud-Based AI: Leveraging Powerful Backends
For more computationally intensive tasks, or when leveraging advanced AI models that are too large for on-device deployment, cloud-based AI services are the way to go. Beyond ML Kit, Firebase offers services like Cloud Firestore for data storage, Cloud Functions for serverless execution of AI logic, and integration with other Google Cloud AI services.Google Cloud AI Platform: This comprehensive suite offers services for custom model training, deployment, and a range of pre-trained APIs for vision, natural language processing, speech-to-text, and more. You can integrate these services into your Flutter app by making API calls from your backend or directly from your Flutter app using packages like  or platform-specific SDKs. Amazon Web Services provides a similar array of AI services, including Amazon Rekognition for image and video analysis, Amazon Comprehend for natural language processing, and Amazon Transcribe for speech-to-text.Azure Cognitive Services: Microsoft Azure offers a suite of AI services that can be integrated into Flutter applications, covering vision, speech, language, and decision-making.Practical Example: Natural Language Processing (Sentiment Analysis)You could use a Flutter app to send user-generated text (e.g., product reviews) to a cloud-based NLP API (like Google Cloud Natural Language API or a custom model hosted on a cloud platform) to perform sentiment analysis. The API would return a sentiment score (positive, negative, neutral), which your Flutter app could then display or use to trigger actions.(Note: This example assumes you have a backend service (like a Cloud Function) that takes text and returns a sentiment analysis result. You'll need to set up and configure this backend separately.)
  
  
  3. Generative AI and LLMs in Flutter
The recent surge in Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3/4 presents exciting new avenues for Flutter development. While directly running massive LLMs on a mobile device is currently challenging, you can integrate with LLM APIs through your backend or specialized SDKs.Code Generation and Assistance: Tools like GitHub Copilot, which are powered by LLMs, can significantly boost developer productivity. While not directly integrated  a Flutter app, they enhance the Flutter development .Content Creation and Summarization: Imagine Flutter apps that can generate personalized marketing copy, summarize long articles, or even help users draft emails using LLMs. Building intelligent chatbots and virtual assistants within your Flutter apps becomes much more feasible with LLM integrations.Considerations for LLM Integration: Securely manage API keys and user authentication. LLM API calls can incur costs and latency. Optimize usage and consider caching. Crafting effective prompts is crucial for getting desired outputs from LLMs.
  
  
  The Future is Intelligent: What's Next for AI-Powered Flutter Apps?
The integration of AI into Flutter is still in its early stages, but the trajectory is clear: smarter, more personalized, and more automated applications. AI will enable Flutter apps to understand user behavior and preferences at a granular level, delivering tailored content, recommendations, and user interfaces. Apps will move from reactive responses to proactive suggestions, anticipating user needs and offering solutions before they're even asked. AI can power features that make Flutter apps more accessible to a wider range of users, such as real-time translation, speech-to-text for input, and image descriptions for visually impaired users. Repetitive and complex tasks within apps can be automated using AI, freeing up users to focus on more meaningful interactions.
  
  
  Challenges and Best Practices
While the potential is immense, there are challenges to consider:Model Size and Performance: On-device models need to be optimized for size and computational efficiency.Data Privacy and Security: Handling user data for AI processing requires careful consideration of privacy regulations and robust security measures.Model Management and Updates: Keeping AI models up-to-date and managing their deployment can be complex. Be mindful of potential biases in AI models and ensure fair and responsible use of AI. Begin with integrating simple AI features before tackling complex projects. Select on-device or cloud-based AI solutions based on your specific needs. Profile and optimize your AI-powered Flutter app for speed and efficiency. Gather user feedback to iterate and improve your AI features. The AI landscape is constantly evolving; keep abreast of new libraries, techniques, and best practices.Flutter's inherent flexibility and efficiency make it a formidable platform for building modern, engaging applications. By embracing the power of AI, developers can elevate their Flutter creations to new heights, delivering experiences that are not only functional but also intelligent, personalized, and truly innovative.

  Flutter Testing Strategies: Building Robust and Reliable Applications
In the dynamic world of mobile development, delivering a seamless and bug-free user experience is paramount. For Flutter developers, this translates to a rigorous and well-defined testing strategy. Flutter, with its declarative UI and rich widget tree, offers a powerful foundation for creating beautiful and performant applications. However, without a robust testing approach, even the most elegant Flutter app can falter under the weight of unexpected bugs and regressions.This article delves into the essential Flutter testing strategies that empower developers to build reliable, maintainable, and high-quality applications. We'll explore the different layers of testing, practical approaches, and how to integrate them effectively into your development workflow.
  
  
  The Pillars of Flutter Testing: A Multi-Layered Approach
Flutter testing isn't a monolithic concept; it's a multi-layered approach designed to catch bugs at different stages of development. Understanding these layers is crucial for building a comprehensive testing strategy:
  
  
  1. Unit Tests: The Foundation of Logic
Unit tests are the bedrock of your testing pyramid. They focus on testing individual functions, methods, or classes in isolation, without any dependencies on the UI or external services. The goal is to verify that each unit of code behaves as expected. Catch logic errors at the earliest possible stage. Well-written unit tests act as living documentation for your code. Enables confident refactoring of code, knowing that existing functionality is preserved. Unit tests are typically very fast to run, providing quick feedback.Practical Example (Widget Logic):Let's consider a simple counter widget where we want to test the increment and decrement functionality.  Testing business logic, utility functions, data models, and helper classes.  Verifying complex algorithms and calculations.
  
  
  2. Widget Tests: The Building Blocks of Your UI
Widget tests, as the name suggests, focus on testing individual Flutter widgets. They allow you to render a widget in isolation and interact with it as a user would, verifying that the UI behaves correctly and responds to user input as expected. Ensure your widgets render correctly and react to user interactions. Test UI components independently, reducing the complexity of larger screens. Faster than integration tests, providing rapid feedback on UI changes.Practical Example (Button Tap):Let's test a button that increments a counter displayed on the screen.  Testing individual UI components, their appearance, and their response to user interactions.  Verifying layout, state changes, and event handling within a widget.
  
  
  3. Integration Tests: The Symphony of Your App
Integration tests, also known as end-to-end (E2E) tests, focus on testing the entire application or significant portions of it. They simulate real user scenarios, interacting with multiple widgets, services, and external dependencies to ensure that all parts of your app work harmoniously.End-to-End Scenario Validation: Ensure that user flows and critical features work seamlessly across the entire application. Test interactions between different components and external services.Realistic User Simulation: Mimic real-world user behavior, uncovering issues that unit or widget tests might miss.Practical Example (Navigation and Data Flow):Testing a scenario where a user taps a button, navigates to a new screen, and sees updated data. This often involves setting up mock data or a mock backend.  Testing complete user flows, critical functionalities, and complex interactions involving multiple widgets.  Validating navigation, data persistence, and API integrations.
  
  
  Beyond the Core: Advanced Testing Strategies
While unit, widget, and integration tests form the backbone, several advanced strategies can further enhance your Flutter app's quality:
  
  
  1. Mocking and Stubbing: Isolating Dependencies
When testing components that rely on external services (e.g., network requests, databases, platform channels), it's crucial to isolate your tests from these dependencies. Mocking and stubbing allow you to create "fake" versions of these dependencies that you can control, ensuring your tests focus solely on the logic of the component being tested. The  package is a popular choice for creating mocks in Dart. Mocking a network service to return specific data.
  
  
  2. Golden Tests (Snapshot Tests): Visual Regression Testing
Golden tests are invaluable for visual regression testing. They capture "golden" images of your widgets and compare them against subsequent renders. Any unexpected visual changes in your UI will be flagged, helping you catch regressions introduced by code changes. Flutter's built-in  package provides excellent support for golden tests.Important Considerations for Golden Tests: Ensure your golden files are generated and tested in a consistent environment (e.g., same device settings, font scaling). Use descriptive file names for your golden images. When intentional UI changes are made, you'll need to update the golden files.
  
  
  3. Performance Testing: Ensuring Responsiveness
While not strictly functional, performance testing is crucial for a smooth user experience. You can use Flutter's built-in profiling tools or specific packages to identify performance bottlenecks, optimize rendering, and ensure your app remains responsive. Offers robust performance profiling, including CPU, memory, and UI rendering. Runs tests with profiling enabled. Ensure your app maintains a consistent frame rate (e.g., 60 FPS).Expensive Operation Identification: Profile your app to find and optimize CPU-intensive tasks. Use DevTools to identify and fix memory leaks.
  
  
  4. Accessibility Testing: Inclusive Design
Ensuring your Flutter app is accessible to all users is vital. Flutter provides tools and best practices for accessibility testing. Understand and leverage Flutter's semantic tree for screen readers. Use properties like  widget, , and  to improve accessibility. Ensure sufficient color contrast for readability. Test if your app can be navigated using a keyboard.
  
  
  Integrating Testing into Your Workflow
A robust testing strategy is only effective if it's integrated seamlessly into your development workflow:Test-Driven Development (TDD): Consider writing tests  writing the actual code. This forces you to think about requirements and expected behavior upfront.Continuous Integration (CI): Automate your tests by integrating them into a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Codemagic). This ensures that all tests are run automatically on every code commit, catching regressions early. Aim for high code coverage, but don't treat it as the sole metric of success. Focus on testing critical paths and complex logic. Conduct regular code reviews where tests are also scrutinized for quality and completeness.
  
  
  Conclusion: Embracing a Culture of Quality
Flutter testing is not merely a phase; it's a continuous process that should be ingrained in the culture of your development team. By embracing a multi-layered testing strategy – from granular unit tests to comprehensive integration tests – and leveraging advanced techniques like mocking and golden tests, you can build Flutter applications that are not only feature-rich but also remarkably robust, reliable, and a joy for users to interact with. Invest in your testing strategy, and you'll reap the rewards of higher quality, reduced maintenance overhead, and ultimately, more successful applications.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Direct &amp; Actionable:</title><link>https://dev.to/sushan_dristi_ab98c07ea8f/direct-actionable-4nen</link><author>Sushan Dristi</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 11:32:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
  
  
  Unlocking the Power of Language: A Developer's Guide to Natural Language Processing (NLP)
The digital landscape is awash in text and speech – emails, social media posts, customer reviews, voice commands, and so much more. For developers, this deluge of human language presents a monumental challenge and, more excitingly, an incredible opportunity. This is where Natural Language Processing (NLP) steps in, bridging the gap between human communication and machine understanding.Gone are the days when NLP was confined to academic research labs. Today, NLP is a cornerstone of modern software development, powering everything from intelligent chatbots and sentiment analysis tools to sophisticated search engines and translation services. For developers, mastering NLP means unlocking new dimensions of functionality and creating truly intelligent, user-centric applications.But what exactly  NLP, and how can developers harness its power? This article aims to demystify NLP, providing a practical overview for developers and tech enthusiasts eager to dive into this transformative field.
  
  
  The Core Concepts: Deconstructing Human Language
At its heart, NLP is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way. This involves a multifaceted approach, breaking down language into its constituent parts and analyzing them for meaning and intent. Key concepts include: The process of breaking down a larger body of text into smaller units, or tokens. These tokens can be words, punctuation marks, or even sub-word units. Think of it as dissecting a sentence into its individual building blocks. The sentence "NLP is fascinating!" would be tokenized into ["NLP", "is", "fascinating", "!"].Stemming and Lemmatization: These are techniques used to reduce words to their root or base form. Stemming is a cruder process, often chopping off suffixes (e.g., "running" -> "runn"). Lemmatization, on the other hand, uses vocabulary and morphological analysis to return the base or dictionary form of a word, known as the lemma (e.g., "running" -> "run", "better" -> "good"). This normalization helps in treating variations of the same word as equivalent.Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: Assigning a grammatical category (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to each token. This helps in understanding the grammatical structure of a sentence and the role each word plays. In "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", POS tagging would identify "The" as a determiner, "quick" as an adjective, "fox" as a noun, and so on.Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying named entities in text, such as persons, organizations, locations, dates, and quantities. NER is crucial for extracting structured information from unstructured text. In "Apple announced its new iPhone in California.", NER would identify "Apple" as an organization and "California" as a location. Determining the emotional tone or opinion expressed in a piece of text, categorizing it as positive, negative, or neutral. This is invaluable for understanding customer feedback, social media trends, and brand perception. Assigning predefined categories or labels to text documents. This is used in spam detection, topic modeling, and categorizing customer support tickets. Representing words as dense numerical vectors in a high-dimensional space. Words with similar meanings are closer to each other in this space. Popular examples include Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText. These embeddings capture semantic relationships between words, significantly improving the performance of downstream NLP tasks.
  
  
  Practical Applications for Developers
The theoretical underpinnings of NLP translate into a wealth of practical applications that developers can leverage:Chatbots and Virtual Assistants: This is perhaps the most visible application of NLP. Developers can build intelligent chatbots that understand user queries, provide relevant information, and even perform actions. Frameworks like  and libraries like  (Natural Language Toolkit) and  are invaluable here.*   **Code Snippet (Conceptual using spaCy):**
    ```python
    import spacy

    nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

    def greet_user(message):
        doc = nlp(message)
        for token in doc:
            if token.text.lower() in ["hello", "hi", "hey"]:
                return "Hello there! How can I help you today?"
        return "I'm not sure I understood. Can you rephrase?"

    print(greet_user("Hi, I need some help."))
    print(greet_user("What's the weather like?"))
    ```
Sentiment Analysis for Business Intelligence: Analyzing customer reviews, social media mentions, and survey responses to gauge public opinion about products or services. This data can inform marketing strategies, product development, and customer service improvements.*   **Example Scenario:** A developer could build a system that scrapes product reviews from an e-commerce site, processes them using a sentiment analysis model, and provides a dashboard of the overall sentiment for different products.
Search and Information Retrieval: Enhancing search functionality by understanding user intent rather than just keyword matching. NLP can enable semantic search, where the system understands the meaning behind a query and returns more relevant results. While complex, building or integrating machine translation services allows applications to break down language barriers and communicate with a global audience. Libraries like Hugging Face Transformers offer state-of-the-art pre-trained translation models. Automatically generating concise summaries of long documents, articles, or reports, saving users time and effort in extracting key information.Spam Detection and Content Moderation: Building systems to identify and filter out unwanted content, such as spam emails or offensive social media posts, creating safer online environments.
  
  
  Essential Tools and Libraries for Developers
The NLP ecosystem is rich with powerful libraries and frameworks that simplify the development process:NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): A foundational library for NLP tasks in Python. It offers modules for tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, POS tagging, and more. While powerful, it can sometimes be slower than more modern alternatives for certain tasks. A more efficient and opinionated library for production-ready NLP. It's known for its speed and ease of use, offering pre-trained models for various languages and tasks like NER and dependency parsing.Hugging Face Transformers: A revolutionary library that provides access to a vast collection of pre-trained state-of-the-art NLP models, including BERT, GPT, and T5. This library makes it incredibly easy to fine-tune these models for specific tasks and integrate them into applications. Primarily focused on topic modeling and document similarity analysis, Gensim is excellent for working with large text corpora. While a general-purpose machine learning library, Scikit-learn provides excellent tools for text feature extraction (e.g., TF-IDF) and various classification algorithms that can be applied to NLP tasks.
  
  
  Getting Started: A Developer's Roadmap
Embarking on your NLP journey as a developer can be an exciting endeavor. Here's a potential roadmap: Python is the de facto language for NLP due to its extensive libraries and community support.Understand Core NLP Concepts: Familiarize yourself with the fundamental techniques outlined earlier.Experiment with Libraries: Start with NLTK or spaCy for basic tasks.

  Unleashing the Power of Your Voice: Integrating Voice Recognition into Flutter Apps
In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, user experience reigns supreme. We're moving beyond traditional touch interfaces, and voice is emerging as a powerful, intuitive, and increasingly common mode of interaction. For Flutter developers, this opens up a fascinating new frontier: seamlessly integrating voice recognition into their applications. Imagine enabling users to control your app with spoken commands, dictating notes, or even conducting complex searches hands-free. This article will dive deep into the world of voice recognition in Flutter, exploring its capabilities, practical implementation, and the exciting possibilities it unlocks.
  
  
  The Growing Importance of Voice in Mobile Applications
Voice interfaces are no longer a novelty. From smart speakers like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant to in-car infotainment systems and the accessibility features on our smartphones, voice-powered interactions are becoming deeply ingrained in our daily lives. This shift is driven by several key factors: Speaking is often faster and more natural than typing, especially for longer inputs or when users are engaged in other activities. Voice recognition can be a game-changer for users with disabilities, providing them with a more inclusive and empowering way to interact with technology. This is crucial in scenarios like driving, cooking, or when multitasking, allowing users to remain focused on their primary tasks.Natural Language Understanding: As speech-to-text and natural language processing (NLP) technologies advance, the ability to understand conversational commands becomes more sophisticated, leading to richer and more intelligent interactions.Flutter, with its cross-platform capabilities and declarative UI, is perfectly positioned to leverage these advancements. By integrating voice recognition, you can significantly enhance the usability, accessibility, and overall appeal of your Flutter applications.
  
  
  Navigating the Flutter Voice Recognition Landscape
Flutter itself doesn't natively provide a robust, built-in solution for voice recognition. However, the Flutter ecosystem is rich with powerful plugins that bridge this gap, allowing us to harness the capabilities of underlying native speech recognition engines on both iOS and Android.The most prominent and widely used plugin for this purpose is . This plugin acts as a bridge, abstracting away the complexities of interacting with the native Speech Recognition APIs of each platform. Let's explore how to get started with it.
  
  
  Getting Started with The first step is to add the  dependency to your  file:After adding the dependency, run  in your terminal to fetch the package.Voice recognition requires access to the device's microphone. You'll need to declare the necessary permissions in your native project files.Android (android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml):iOS ():NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescriptionThis app needs access to your microphone to use voice recognition.NSMicrophoneUsageDescriptionThis app needs access to your microphone to record audio.3. Core Implementation: A Practical ExampleLet's build a simple Flutter application that listens for voice input and displays the recognized text._speech = stt.SpeechToText(): Initializes an instance of the  class. This is a crucial step. It initializes the speech recognition service. The  callback provides updates on the listening status, and  is for handling any errors. It returns a boolean indicating if the service is available. A boolean flag to track the current listening state. Starts the listening process. The  callback receives the recognized words from the speech. Stops the listening process. The  toggles between listening and stopping, and a  widget displays the recognized words. An error message is shown if microphone access is denied.
  
  
  Advanced Features and Considerations
The  plugin offers more than just basic speech-to-text conversion. Here are some advanced features and considerations: Speech recognition engines are highly dependent on language. The  plugin allows you to specify the locale for recognition, enabling support for multiple languages.You can get a list of available locales using . The  method can also provide partial results as the user is speaking, offering a more dynamic and responsive UI. You can control this with the  parameter in the  method.Speech Recognition Engine Specifics: While  abstracts much of the complexity, keep in mind that the underlying speech recognition engines (Google Speech Recognition on Android, Apple's Speech Recognition on iOS) have their own capabilities and limitations. Factors like background noise, accent, and clarity of speech can influence accuracy. Robust error handling is essential. The  callback in  and potential network errors (if the service relies on cloud-based recognition) should be addressed. Providing clear visual feedback to the user about the listening state (e.g., a pulsating microphone icon, visual indication of speech activity) is crucial for a good user experience. Always be transparent with your users about why you need microphone access and clearly explain how their voice data will be used. Follow best practices for handling user data and permissions.
  
  
  Beyond Basic Transcription: Intent Recognition and NLP
While transcribing spoken words is the foundation, the true power of voice interfaces lies in understanding the  behind those words. This is where Natural Language Processing (NLP) comes into play.For more advanced voice interactions, you might consider integrating NLP services. These services can: Recognize specific actions the user wants to perform (e.g., "Play music," "Set a timer"). Pull out key information from the spoken input (e.g., the song title, the duration of the timer).Handle Conversational Flow: Understand context and maintain a natural dialogue with the user.While Flutter plugins for direct NLP integration with speech might be more specialized, you can achieve this by:Capturing Speech with : Get the transcribed text.Sending Text to an NLP Service: Utilize cloud-based NLP services like Google Cloud Natural Language API, AWS Comprehend, or Rasa for intent recognition and entity extraction.Acting on Recognized Intents: Implement logic in your Flutter app based on the NLP service's output.This approach allows for sophisticated voice control and conversational capabilities within your Flutter applications.
  
  
  Use Cases and Applications
The integration of voice recognition in Flutter opens up a plethora of exciting application possibilities:Dictation and Note-Taking Apps: Effortlessly capture thoughts and ideas.Voice-Controlled E-commerce: Search for products, add to cart, and even checkout using voice commands. Interact with connected devices in your home through your Flutter app. Empower users with visual impairments or mobility issues.Interactive Learning Platforms: Allow students to answer questions or navigate content with their voice. Implement voice commands for in-game actions. Build more engaging and natural conversational interfaces.Voice recognition is no longer a futuristic concept; it's a present-day reality that can significantly enhance your Flutter applications. By leveraging plugins like  and understanding the principles of user experience and, potentially, NLP, you can create more intuitive, accessible, and engaging experiences for your users. As the field of voice technology continues to mature, Flutter developers are well-equipped to harness its power and build the next generation of voice-enabled applications. So, start experimenting, explore the possibilities, and unleash the power of your users' voices!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pros and Cons of Popular Programming Languages — Which One Should You Choose?</title><link>https://dev.to/theodor_coin_4/pros-and-cons-of-popular-programming-languages-which-one-should-you-choose-45je</link><author>Theodor Coin</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 11:17:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Choosing a programming language can feel overwhelming, especially when you’re starting out or looking to switch gears.

  Flutter Meets GraphQL: Building Dynamic, Efficient, and Scalable Mobile Applications
In the ever-evolving landscape of mobile development, developers are constantly seeking robust and efficient tools to craft exceptional user experiences. Flutter, Google's UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase, has rapidly gained traction for its performance, developer productivity, and beautiful UIs. Simultaneously, GraphQL, a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data, has emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional REST APIs, offering greater flexibility and efficiency in data fetching.The synergy between Flutter and GraphQL presents a compelling proposition for modern application development. This article delves into why this combination is so powerful, explores the key benefits, and provides practical insights for integrating them into your Flutter projects.
  
  
  Why the Flutter and GraphQL Love Affair?
Traditionally, mobile applications relied heavily on REST APIs for data retrieval. While effective, REST can sometimes lead to issues like over-fetching (downloading more data than necessary) and under-fetching (requiring multiple requests to gather all required data). This is where GraphQL shines.GraphQL allows clients to request exactly the data they need, no more and no less. This translates to: Smaller payloads mean faster data transfer and a better user experience, especially on mobile networks.Improved Developer Experience: Clients have more control over the data they receive, simplifying data management and reducing the need for complex data manipulation on the client side. Single endpoints can serve multiple queries, eliminating the need for multiple round trips to the server. GraphQL APIs define their data with a schema, providing a clear contract between the client and server, which aids in early error detection and better tooling.Flutter, with its declarative UI and efficient rendering engine, is perfectly poised to leverage these GraphQL advantages. The ability to precisely define data requirements in Flutter aligns seamlessly with GraphQL's query-centric approach.
  
  
  Key Libraries and Tools for Flutter and GraphQL Integration
To harness the power of GraphQL within your Flutter applications, you'll need a few key libraries: This is the de facto standard package for integrating GraphQL into Flutter projects. It provides a  to interact with your GraphQL endpoint, a  abstraction for managing network requests (HTTP, WebSockets, etc.), and powerful widgets like , , and  that make integrating GraphQL data into your UI declarative and intuitive. This package assists in parsing GraphQL query strings into a structured format that  can understand. For making HTTP requests, which is fundamental for most GraphQL communication.
  
  
  Practical Implementation: Fetching Data with Let's walk through a basic example of fetching data from a GraphQL API in Flutter. Imagine you have a GraphQL API that returns a list of books, each with a title and author.1. Setting up the GraphQL Client:First, you'll need to initialize your . This typically involves defining your GraphQL endpoint and setting up an  if authentication is required.2. Defining Your GraphQL Query:Create your GraphQL query as a string. You'll specify the fields you want to retrieve.The  widget from  simplifies the process of executing queries and handling their results.  The  parameter takes  where we provide our parsed GraphQL query using .  The  function receives the . We check for exceptions and loading states, and then render our list of books. holds the fetched data, which we cast to  for our  list.
  
  
  Mutations and Subscriptions
Beyond fetching data, GraphQL also supports mutations (for changing data) and subscriptions (for real-time updates).  provides  and  widgets similarly to , allowing you to seamlessly integrate these operations into your Flutter app. For updating, creating, or deleting data, you'd use a  widget, similar in structure to , but designed for executing operations that modify data on the server. To receive real-time updates (e.g., for chat applications or live dashboards), you'd employ the  widget, which establishes a persistent connection (often via WebSockets) to receive data as it changes on the server.
  
  
  Benefits of This Powerful Combination
Faster Development Cycles: GraphQL's schema and Flutter's declarative UI accelerate development by providing clear contracts and reducing boilerplate code. Efficient data fetching directly impacts application speed and responsiveness, crucial for a positive user experience. As your application grows, GraphQL's flexible querying and Flutter's robust architecture provide a solid foundation for scaling.Type Safety and Predictability: The strongly typed nature of GraphQL schemas, combined with Flutter's Dart, leads to more predictable and maintainable code. By avoiding over-fetching and under-fetching, you minimize the need for complex data handling logic on the client, reducing potential sources of bugs and technical debt.
  
  
  Considerations and Best Practices

In this article, we’ll explore how Suno AI works, trace its evolution, highlight the very latest features, unpack legal and ethical concerns, and show you how to get started yourself. I’ll speak directly to you throughout. Ready to make some music with AI? Let’s go!Suno AI is a generative artificial intelligence music creator, launched in December 2023 by Suno, Inc., a Cambridge‑based startup founded by former Kensho engineers: Michael Shulman, Georg Kucsko, Martin Camacho, and Keenan Freyberg . Designed to democratize music production, Suno transforms text prompts into complete songs, blending vocals, instrumentation, genre-appropriate arrangements, and even artwork—all via web, mobile, and integration into Microsoft Copilot.As users type prompts describing genre, mood, lyrics, or instrumentation, Suno’s underlying AI models interpret that input, extract musical elements, and generate high‑quality, often multi‑minute compositions. It’s comparable to ChatGPT—but for music .Suno AI’s rapid development is reflected in its release history:: Initial launch.: Release of v3 model, enabling free 4‑min song generation.: Launch of v4 model.: Suno released  with major enhancements .
  
  
  Artistic depth vs AI convenience
 can feel superficial; more advanced editing is often needed .: work best with Western genres; niche or experimental styles may be less convincing .: prompt outputs can vary, making consistent results challenging .: polishing AI-generated tracks still requires producer skill.
  
  
  The Bark and Chirp models
Under the hood, Suno AI relies on two core neural models: , which crafts realistic vocal melodies and lyrics, and , which handles instrumentation and sound effects. Both are diffusion‑style generators trained on vast collections of audio, allowing them to learn patterns of rhythm, harmony, and timbre.When you type a prompt, Suno AI’s natural‑language pipeline parses keywords (genre, mood, tempo, theme) and transforms them into internal representations. These guide Bark and Chirp during generation, ensuring the output aligns with your vision. For instance, if you mention “soulful ballad,” Bark adjusts vocal inflection while Chirp selects richer chord progressions .After parsing, the models generate audio samples in segments, stitching them together into coherent tracks. A post‑processing module refines transitions and balances levels, so you get a polished song without needing to tweak equalizers or compressors yourself.
  
  
  How does Suno transform text prompts into music?
When you type a prompt like “uplifting electronic track with female vocals about morning coffee,” Suno’s pipeline kicks in. First, a text encoder parses your words into a high-dimensional representation. Next, a sequence model decodes this representation into musical features—melody, harmony, rhythm, and even vocal timbre. Finally, a neural vocoder renders the audio waveform, producing full songs complete with instrumentation and lyrics. This entire process takes about 60 seconds, giving you a quick, interactive creation experience.

  Building Robust Flutter Apps: Navigating the Landscape of Architecture Patterns
Flutter's declarative UI paradigm and hot-reload feature have revolutionized mobile development, empowering developers to build beautiful, performant applications for multiple platforms with a single codebase. However, as projects grow in complexity, maintaining a clean, scalable, and testable codebase becomes paramount. This is where Flutter architecture patterns come into play.Choosing the right architectural pattern is not merely about following trends; it's about establishing a solid foundation that promotes maintainability, testability, and team collaboration. It dictates how your code is organized, how different parts of your application communicate, and ultimately, how easily you can adapt to evolving requirements. This article will delve into some of the most popular and effective Flutter architecture patterns, equipping you with the knowledge to make informed decisions for your next project.
  
  
  Why Bother with Architecture? The Pillars of Well-Structured Code
Before diving into specific patterns, let's reiterate the core benefits of adopting a well-defined architecture: Clearly separated concerns make it easier to understand, debug, and modify code without introducing unintended side effects. A robust architecture can accommodate increasing complexity and features as your application grows. Well-defined interfaces and separation of logic enable easier unit, widget, and integration testing. A consistent structure promotes a shared understanding among developers, facilitating smoother teamwork. Proactive architectural planning prevents the accumulation of messy, hard-to-manage code.
  
  
  Popular Flutter Architecture Patterns: A Comparative Look
While no single pattern is a silver bullet, understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each allows you to select the best fit for your project's specific needs.
  
  
  1. Provider: Simplicity and State Management Elegance
Provider is arguably the most popular and officially recommended state management solution in Flutter. It leverages the  mechanism to efficiently provide data down the widget tree. Its simplicity and ease of integration make it an excellent choice for small to medium-sized applications or for managing local widget state. A mixin that allows you to notify listeners when data changes. A widget that exposes a  instance to its descendants. A widget that listens for changes in a  and rebuilds itself accordingly. / : Methods to access the provided  instance.  Managing UI state (e.g., toggling a button, showing/hiding a modal).  Sharing simple data across widgets.  When you prioritize ease of learning and implementation.
  
  
  2. Riverpod: Unlocking Provider's Full Potential
Riverpod, created by the same author of Provider, is a reimagining of the state management library, aiming to address some of Provider's limitations, particularly around compile-time safety and testability. It provides a more robust and flexible solution for managing state and dependencies. Riverpod introduces various provider types (e.g., , , , , ) that encapsulate different types of data and logic. Similar to Provider, but often more flexible in how they subscribe to changes. Riverpod's use of generic types and compile-time checks significantly reduces runtime errors. Providers can be scoped to different parts of your application, offering better control over data lifecycle.  Larger and more complex applications.  When compile-time safety and enhanced testability are critical.  When you need more control over provider scopes and dependencies.  For asynchronous operations and streams.
  
  
  3. BLoC (Business Logic Component): Separating UI from Logic
BLoC is a popular pattern for managing state in Flutter applications, promoting a clear separation between the UI and business logic. It utilizes streams for communication, making it ideal for handling complex asynchronous operations and managing state transitions effectively. Actions triggered by the UI. Representations of the UI's current condition. A class that receives events, processes them, and emits states. Used for unidirectional data flow from BLoC to UI.  Complex state management scenarios with intricate logic.  Applications requiring extensive asynchronous operations.  When a strict separation of concerns is a priority.  For building testable and maintainable business logic.Example Snippet (using  package):
  
  
  4. GetX: The All-in-One Solution
GetX is a microframework that simplifies Flutter development by providing solutions for state management, route management, dependency injection, and more. Its focus on performance and ease of use has made it a popular choice for many developers. Similar to  but more efficient for updating specific widgets. Reactively listens to observable variables () and rebuilds widgets when their values change. Classes that hold the state and business logic, often extended from . Simplified with , .  Rapid prototyping and development.  When you prefer an all-in-one solution for state and route management.  For developers who value conciseness and minimal boilerplate.
  
  
  5. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel): Decoupling and Testability
MVVM is a more traditional architectural pattern that emphasizes the separation of concerns between the UI (View), the data (Model), and the logic that bridges them (ViewModel). It's particularly valuable for complex applications where extensive testing and maintainability are crucial. Represents the data and business logic. The UI layer, responsible for displaying data and capturing user input. It should be as "dumb" as possible. Acts as an intermediary between the View and the Model. It exposes data from the Model in a format that the View can easily consume and handles user interactions by updating the Model. The ViewModel should not have direct references to the View.  Large and complex applications requiring high testability and maintainability.  When you need a clear separation between UI and business logic.  For projects with a strong emphasis on team collaboration and code organization.Implementing MVVM in Flutter:While Flutter doesn't have a built-in MVVM implementation, you can achieve it by combining state management solutions (like Provider, Riverpod, or BLoC) with a clear separation of your components. The ViewModel would typically be managed by your chosen state management solution.Conceptual Example (using Provider for ViewModel):
  
  
  Choosing the Right Pattern: A Decision Framework
The "best" architecture is context-dependent. Consider these factors when making your choice:Project Size and Complexity: Simple apps might thrive with Provider, while complex ones might benefit from BLoC or Riverpod. Leverage your team's existing knowledge and comfort levels.Testability Requirements: If extensive unit testing is a priority, patterns with clear separation and stream-based communication (like BLoC) can be advantageous. How do you anticipate your app growing? Choose a pattern that can adapt to future demands. For rapid prototyping, solutions like GetX can offer a faster initial development pace.It's also important to note that these patterns are not mutually exclusive. You can often combine elements of different patterns or use them to manage different aspects of your application. For example, you might use Provider for UI state and BLoC for complex business logic.
  
  
  Beyond the Big Names: Other Considerations
While the patterns above are prominent, Flutter's flexibility allows for other architectural approaches, including: A more comprehensive approach that emphasizes layers of abstraction and dependency inversion for maximum testability and maintainability. For robust dependency injection, which is crucial for larger projects.
  
  
  Conclusion: Architecting for Success
Flutter's ecosystem offers a rich selection of architecture patterns, each with its own strengths and philosophies. By understanding the core principles behind Provider, Riverpod, BLoC, MVVM, and others, you can make informed decisions that lead to cleaner, more maintainable, and scalable Flutter applications. Don't be afraid to experiment and adapt; the most effective architecture is the one that best serves your project's unique requirements and your team's workflow.Embracing a well-defined architecture from the outset is an investment that pays dividends throughout the lifecycle of your Flutter application. It's the key to building not just functional apps, but robust, resilient, and future-proof digital experiences.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI for App Personalization: Boost Engagement</title><link>https://dev.to/sushan_dristi_ab98c07ea8f/ai-for-app-personalization-boost-engagement-53-chars-55al</link><author>Sushan Dristi</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 10:26:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
  
  
  Beyond the Generic: Unlocking Hyper-Personalization with AI in Your Apps
In today's crowded digital landscape, a one-size-fits-all approach to user experience is a surefire path to mediocrity. Users expect more. They crave experiences that anticipate their needs, cater to their preferences, and feel uniquely crafted for them. This is where the transformative power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) enters the stage, revolutionizing app personalization and elevating user engagement to unprecedented heights.For developers and tech enthusiasts, understanding and implementing AI-driven personalization isn't just a competitive edge; it's becoming a fundamental requirement for building successful, sticky applications. This article will delve into the core concepts, practical applications, and technical considerations of using AI to deliver hyper-personalized experiences within your apps.
  
  
  The Evolution of Personalization: From Rules to Intelligence
Historically, personalization in apps often relied on static, rule-based systems. Think "if user has X item in cart, show them Y product." While effective to a degree, these methods were limited by their rigidity and inability to adapt to dynamic user behavior.AI, particularly machine learning (ML), has shattered these limitations. Instead of predefined rules, AI algorithms learn from vast datasets of user interactions, preferences, and contextual information. This allows them to identify intricate patterns, predict future behavior, and dynamically adjust the app's interface, content, and features in real-time.
  
  
  Pillars of AI-Driven App Personalization
At its heart, AI for app personalization revolves around understanding and responding to the individual user. This can be broken down into several key pillars:
  
  
  1. User Behavior Analysis and Prediction
This is the bedrock of AI personalization. By analyzing how users interact with your app – clicks, scrolls, time spent on pages, search queries, purchase history, feature usage – ML models can build a comprehensive profile of each user. Recommending items based on what similar users have liked or interacted with. Think Netflix or Amazon. Recommending items similar to those the user has previously shown interest in, based on item attributes.Sequence Modeling (e.g., RNNs, LSTMs): Understanding the temporal nature of user actions to predict the next likely interaction or need.Clustering Algorithms (e.g., K-Means): Grouping users with similar behaviors to tailor experiences to these segments. An e-commerce app could use collaborative filtering to suggest products that users who purchased the same item as the current user also bought.This snippet illustrates the concept of finding similar items based on user interactions, forming the basis of recommendation engines.Understanding the "when," "where," and "how" of user interaction is crucial. This includes factors like time of day, location, device, current task, and even external events.Rule-based systems integrated with ML: Using ML to predict contextual states and then applying rules for personalization. Understanding temporal patterns in behavior. Leveraging location data. A travel app could offer flight deals to destinations the user has recently searched for, but only during their typical travel planning hours (e.g., evenings).
  
  
  3. Dynamic Content and UI Adaptation
This is where personalization truly comes alive. AI can dynamically adjust various aspects of the app's presentation and functionality.Personalized Content Feeds: Displaying articles, videos, or products most relevant to the user's interests.Adaptive User Interfaces: Rearranging navigation, highlighting features, or changing button placements based on user behavior.Customized Notifications: Sending alerts at optimal times and with tailored messages. Guiding new users through features most likely to be relevant to them. A news app could use natural language processing (NLP) to understand the sentiment and topics within articles, then present a personalized feed based on user reading history and expressed preferences.This snippet demonstrates how NLP can be used to understand content, a crucial step in personalizing what users see.
  
  
  4. Predictive Personalization (Proactive Engagement)
The ultimate goal is to move beyond reacting to user actions to anticipating their needs.Predictive Churn Prevention: Identifying users at risk of leaving and offering targeted incentives or support.Proactive Feature Discovery: Suggesting features a user might benefit from but hasn't yet discovered. Offering relevant actions before the user even articulates them (e.g., suggesting a calendar reminder based on a conversation). A fitness app could predict when a user might be experiencing a plateau and proactively suggest new workout routines or motivational content.
  
  
  Implementing AI for App Personalization: Key Considerations
Embarking on the AI personalization journey requires careful planning and execution: High-quality, well-structured data is paramount. This involves collecting relevant user interaction data, consent management, and robust data pipelines.Choosing the Right AI Models: The choice of ML model depends on the specific personalization task. For recommendations, collaborative filtering and content-based methods are common. For sequential data, RNNs are powerful. For text analysis, NLP models are essential.Integration with Existing Infrastructure: Seamlessly integrating AI models into your app's backend and frontend is critical. Consider using cloud-based ML platforms (AWS SageMaker, Google AI Platform, Azure ML) or dedicated recommendation engine services.A/B Testing and Iteration: Continuously test and refine your personalization strategies. A/B testing allows you to measure the impact of different AI models and personalization approaches on key metrics like engagement, conversion rates, and user satisfaction.Ethical Considerations and Transparency: Be mindful of data privacy, bias in algorithms, and user trust. Clearly communicate how personalization works and provide users with control over their data. Avoid "creepy" personalization that feels intrusive. As your user base grows, your AI infrastructure must scale to handle the increased data and processing demands.
  
  
  The Future is Personalized
AI for app personalization is not a fleeting trend; it's a fundamental shift in how we design and build digital experiences. By leveraging the power of AI, developers can move beyond generic interfaces and create apps that are not only functional but also deeply engaging, intuitive, and uniquely tailored to each individual user. This leads to increased customer loyalty, higher conversion rates, and ultimately, more successful and impactful applications.The journey to hyper-personalization is ongoing, requiring a commitment to data-driven decision-making, continuous learning, and a user-centric mindset. Embrace the power of AI, and unlock a new era of personalized user experiences in your apps.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Ultimate Guide to Image Formats: GIF vs JPG vs PNG (And When to Convert Between Them)</title><link>https://dev.to/hardik_b2d8f0bca/the-ultimate-guide-to-image-formats-gif-vs-jpg-vs-png-and-when-to-convert-between-them-51ml</link><author>Hardi</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 10:25:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As developers and designers, we deal with images constantly. Whether you're optimizing a website, building an app, or creating marketing materials, choosing the right image format can make or break your project's performance and visual quality.Let's dive deep into the three most common image formats and understand when to use each one.
  
  
  The Big Three: Understanding Each Format

  
  
  JPEG/JPG: The Photography Champion
JPEG dominates the web for good reason. Its lossy compression algorithm excels at reducing file sizes while maintaining acceptable quality for photographs.: Lossy (discards data to reduce file size): 24-bit (16.7 million colors): Not supported: Photographs, complex images with gradients: A typical photo might be 2-3MB as PNG but only 200-500KB as JPEG with minimal visible quality loss.
  
  
  PNG: The Quality Perfectionist
PNG was designed to replace GIF with better compression and full color support. It's the go-to format when quality cannot be compromised.: Lossless (no quality loss): 24-bit or 32-bit (with alpha channel): Full alpha transparency: Not supported (APNG exists but limited browser support): Logos, icons, graphics with text, screenshots: PNG-8 exists as a palette-based version (256 colors) that can be smaller than PNG-24 for simple graphics.
  
  
  GIF: The Animation Veteran
Despite being from 1987, GIF remains relevant primarily for its animation capabilities and widespread support.: Lossless but limited: 8-bit (256 colors maximum): Basic (on/off, no partial transparency): Supported with frame-based animation: Simple animations, memes, basic graphics
  
  
  Real-World Performance Comparison
Let's look at actual file sizes for the same image:Original photo (1920x1080):
├── PNG: 2.1MB (lossless)
├── JPEG (90% quality): 284KB
├── JPEG (70% quality): 156KB
└── GIF: 1.8MB (dithered, poor quality)

Logo with transparency (500x200):
├── PNG: 45KB (perfect)
├── JPEG: 38KB (no transparency, white bg)
└── GIF: 67KB (limited colors)
Sometimes you need to convert between formats. Here are common scenarios:Adding transparency to existing graphicsPreparing images for print (quality preservation)Creating graphics with sharp text or linesScreenshots and UI elementsReducing file sizes for web optimizationEmail attachments (size limits)Creating simple animationsLegacy system requirements
  
  
  Code Example: Optimizing Images in Your Workflow
Here's a simple Node.js example using Sharp for programmatic image conversion:
  
  
  Web Performance Best Practices
 - 70-90% quality usually provides the best size/quality balance - Logos, icons, and images with transparency - Modern format with better compression (but check browser support)Implement responsive images - Serve different formats based on browser capabilities

  
  
  Quick Conversion Solutions
For developers who need quick format conversions without setting up complex toolchains, online converters can be invaluable during development and testing phases. Tools like ConverterToolsKit provide instant conversions while you're prototyping or need to quickly test different formats.Understanding image formats isn't just about technical specs - it's about making informed decisions that impact user experience, page load times, and project success. Graphics with transparency → PNG
 → JPEG (with quality adjustment)The key is testing different formats with your specific content and measuring the results. What works for one project might not work for another.What's your go-to image format for web development? Have you experimented with newer formats like WebP or AVIF?

  The Why: Unlocking the Power of CI/CD for Flutter
Traditionally, the software development lifecycle involved manual testing, building, and deployment stages, which were often time-consuming, error-prone, and prone to bottlenecks. CI/CD transforms this by automating these processes, fostering a culture of frequent integration and rapid delivery. For Flutter, this translates to: Automating builds and deployments means you can get new features and bug fixes into the hands of your users much quicker. Automated testing at various stages catches bugs early, preventing them from reaching production. Eliminating manual steps minimizes the risk of human error, ensuring consistency and reliability.Increased Developer Productivity: Developers can focus on writing code, rather than wrestling with manual build and deployment tasks. Continuous delivery allows for quicker feedback from stakeholders and users, enabling agile iteration.
  
  
  The What: Deconstructing the Flutter CI/CD Pipeline
A CI/CD pipeline is a series of automated steps that take your code from development to production. For a Flutter project, this typically involves the following key stages:
  
  
  1. Continuous Integration (CI): The Foundation of Collaboration
CI is the practice of merging code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository frequently. Each integration is then verified by an automated build and automated tests. A cornerstone of CI is a robust version control system like Git, hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. This allows for tracking changes, collaborating effectively, and managing different branches. This is where your Flutter project is compiled into deployable artifacts. For Flutter, this means generating  files for Android and  files for iOS.Example using :
flutter build apk 
flutter build ipa /path/to/ExportOptions.plist
The  file is crucial for iOS builds, specifying signing certificates and provisioning profiles. This is arguably the most critical part of CI. For Flutter, this includes: Testing individual functions or methods in isolation. Testing individual Flutter widgets in isolation. Testing the complete app flow, simulating user interactions. These are typically run on emulators or physical devices.flutter integration_test/app_test.dart
Static Code Analysis (Linting): Tools like  and  help enforce coding standards and identify potential issues before runtime.dart analyze 
flutter analyze You can configure linting rules in a  file.
  
  
  2. Continuous Delivery (CD): Getting Your App to Users
CD extends CI by automatically deploying your application to various environments after successful integration and testing. A pre-production environment that mirrors production as closely as possible. This is where you can perform further testing, including user acceptance testing (UAT). The live environment where your users access the application.App Store/Play Store Deployment: Automating the upload process to Apple App Store Connect and Google Play Console. This often involves using command-line tools provided by the respective platforms or third-party services. For internal testing or beta releases, you can use platforms like Firebase App Distribution, TestFlight, or custom enterprise solutions.Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates: For specific scenarios, tools like CodePush (though primarily for React Native, similar concepts can be explored with Flutter for web or other dynamic updates) can be relevant.
  
  
  Building Your Flutter CI/CD Pipeline: Tools and Platforms
Several platforms and tools can help you establish your Flutter CI/CD pipeline. The choice often depends on your project's complexity, team size, and existing infrastructure. A powerful and popular choice for automating workflows directly within GitHub.

  Mastering the Flow: Advanced Flutter State Management for Scalable and Maintainable Apps
Flutter's declarative UI paradigm, while incredibly powerful, relies heavily on efficient and predictable state management. As your applications grow in complexity, the simple  can quickly become a bottleneck, leading to unmanageable code, performance issues, and a frustrating development experience. This is where advanced state management techniques come into play, empowering you to build robust, scalable, and maintainable Flutter applications.In this article, we'll dive deep into the world of advanced Flutter state management, exploring powerful patterns and popular solutions that go beyond the basics. Whether you're a seasoned Flutter developer or a tech enthusiast keen on understanding the inner workings of high-performance mobile apps, this guide will equip you with the knowledge to effectively manage your application's state.
  
  
  Why Go Beyond ? The Case for Advanced State Management
While  is sufficient for simple UIs and local component state, it struggles with: Passing state down through multiple widget layers becomes cumbersome and inefficient. Rebuilding entire widget subtrees when only a small part of the state changes can lead to performance degradation. Centralizing state logic becomes challenging, leading to scattered and difficult-to-maintain code. Widgets that depend heavily on local state can be harder to unit test in isolation. Managing asynchronous operations, user interactions, and data synchronization across different parts of the app can become a tangled mess.Advanced state management solutions address these challenges by providing structured ways to: Store application-wide state in a single, accessible location. Separate business logic and state manipulation from the UI widgets. Ensure that only the necessary widgets are rebuilt when state changes. Make it easier to test individual components and state logic independently. Provide a clear and consistent pattern for teams to follow.
  
  
  Exploring the Landscape: Popular Advanced State Management Solutions
Flutter's flexibility means there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. The "best" approach often depends on the project's complexity, team preferences, and specific requirements. Here are some of the most popular and effective advanced state management solutions:
  
  
  1. Provider: The Foundation of Modern Flutter State Management
The  package, built by the Flutter team itself, is a highly recommended and widely adopted solution. It leverages the  mechanism in Flutter to make data accessible to descendant widgets efficiently. A class that allows you to notify listeners (widgets) when its state changes. A widget that provides an instance of  to its descendants. A widget that listens to changes in a  and rebuilds itself when notified. A method to access the  from the widget tree.Let's manage a simple counter:Provider is an excellent starting point for most Flutter applications. It's simple to learn, flexible, and scales well for moderate to complex applications. It's particularly effective for:  Sharing simple data across widget trees.  Managing UI state like theme preferences, authentication status, etc.  Implementing simple data fetching and caching.
  
  
  2. Riverpod: The Next Evolution of Provider
Riverpod is a complete rewrite of Provider, aiming to solve some of its limitations while retaining its ease of use. It introduces a compile-time safe approach to state management, reducing runtime errors and improving developer experience. A global provider that doesn't depend on . For simple immutable states. For mutable states managed by . / : For asynchronous data. / : Widgets that can consume providers.Practical Example (using ):Riverpod is a fantastic choice for new projects or when refactoring existing ones. Its compile-time safety and global provider approach make it very robust and scalable. Consider Riverpod for:  Applications with complex state dependencies.  Teams prioritizing type safety and early error detection.  Projects requiring efficient handling of asynchronous operations.
  
  
  3. BLoC (Business Logic Component) / Cubit: For Robust Event-Driven Architectures
The  package is a powerful and popular solution for managing state in a predictable and reactive way. It's inspired by the BLoC design pattern, which separates UI from business logic through events and states. Cubit is a simpler, more streamlined version of BLoC. Represent user interactions or actions that trigger state changes. Represent the different UI states of your application. The core logic component that receives events and emits states. Provides a Bloc/Cubit to its descendants. Rebuilds the UI when the Bloc's state changes. For performing side effects (e.g., navigation, showing snackbars) when the state changes.Practical Example (using Cubit):BLoC is a robust choice for larger, more complex applications where a clear separation of concerns and an event-driven architecture are crucial. Cubit is a great alternative for simpler state management needs within a BLoC-like structure. Consider BLoC/Cubit for:  Applications with complex business logic and multiple interconnected states.  Projects requiring extensive testing of business logic.  Teams familiar with event-driven architectures.
  
  
  4. GetX: The All-in-One Solution
GetX is a micro-framework that aims to simplify Flutter development by providing state management, dependency injection, route management, and utility functions in a single package. For simple state updates. For reactive state management using observables. A controller that manages state.Practical Example (using  and ):GetX is a good option for developers who prefer an opinionated, all-in-one solution that simplifies many aspects of Flutter development. It's particularly beneficial for:  Rapid prototyping and development.  Smaller to medium-sized projects where simplicity is prioritized.  Developers looking for integrated route and dependency management.
  
  
  Choosing the Right Tool for the Job
The decision of which state management solution to adopt is crucial for your project's success. Consider these factors:Project Size and Complexity: For smaller projects, Provider or Cubit might suffice. For larger, more intricate applications, Riverpod or BLoC could offer better scalability. If your team is already proficient with a particular solution, leveraging that expertise can accelerate development. While all these solutions are designed to be manageable, some might have a steeper learning curve than others.Community Support and Documentation: A strong community and comprehensive documentation can be invaluable when encountering challenges. Some solutions offer unique features like compile-time safety (Riverpod), event-driven architecture (BLoC), or integrated utilities (GetX) that might align with your project's needs.
  
  
  Beyond the Basics: Best Practices for Advanced State Management
Regardless of the solution you choose, adhering to best practices will ensure your state management remains robust and maintainable: Only store what's necessary for the UI. Avoid storing UI-specific details within your state models. Clearly distinguish between business logic, data fetching, and UI presentation. While not always strictly enforced by every solution, striving for immutable state updates can prevent unexpected bugs. Understand how your chosen solution handles rebuilds and ensure you're not unnecessarily re-rendering large parts of your UI. Thoroughly test your state logic to ensure correctness and prevent regressions. Especially in larger teams, clear documentation on how state is managed is essential for onboarding and maintenance.Mastering advanced Flutter state management is a vital step in building sophisticated, performant, and maintainable applications. By understanding the strengths of solutions like Provider, Riverpod, BLoC, and GetX, and by adhering to best practices, you can effectively manage the flow of data and logic in your Flutter projects. The journey of state management in Flutter is one of continuous learning and adaptation, and embracing these advanced techniques will undoubtedly empower you to create exceptional mobile experiences.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Essential Features of a Secure Cryptocurrency Exchange Platform</title><link>https://dev.to/danieljt/essential-features-of-a-secure-cryptocurrency-exchange-platform-29f6</link><author>Daniel Jt_Marketing2024</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 09:25:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
Cryptocurrency is booming, but with great power comes great vulnerability. As millions dive into digital assets, ensuring the security of a cryptocurrency exchange platform is more important than ever. It’s not just about building a shiny platform; it’s about protecting billions in value.
In this article, we’ll explore the essential features that make a crypto exchange not just functional, but fortified.What is a cryptocurrency exchange?A cryptocurrency exchange is a digital platform where users can buy, sell, or trade cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others. It operates similarly to a stock exchange but for digital assets, allowing users to convert fiat money into crypto and vice versa. Exchanges may be decentralized or centralized exchange scripts.Features of Cryptocurrency Exchange PlatformUser Authentication & Access Control
If a user’s password is the lock, 2FA is the deadbolt. A must-have in any , 2FA adds a critical extra layer of protection using OTPs or authentication apps like Google Authenticator.Biometrics like fingerprints or facial recognition create unique barriers to intrusion. Multi-signature wallets require multiple keys to access funds, making it nearly impossible for hackers to gain full control.
End-to-end encryption ensures that only the sender and recipient can read the data, not even the server. This is the foundation of trust between a platform and its users.Always check for that “https://” in the URL. It’s more than just a padlock icon—it encrypts traffic to block out eavesdroppers.
Cold wallets are offline storage systems. Unlike hot wallets that are connected to the internet, cold wallets store funds in a disconnected, hack-proof environment.Using cold wallets for bulk user funds prevents massive losses in case of an attack. It’s like keeping your treasure in a vault rather than a drawer.Secure Transaction Protocols
Every transaction should be tracked in real time to detect anomalies instantly. Think of it as having CCTV inside a bank vault.Automated alerts notify admins of irregular behavior, like multiple login attempts or huge fund transfers, giving your team a chance to act before damage is done.
A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack floods your servers with fake traffic, crashing your site and exposing security gaps.Without DDoS protection, your platform becomes a sitting duck. Firewalls and traffic filters are your first line of defense.
KYC ensures that every user is verified, protecting your exchange from fraud and illegal activity.AML monitors user transactions for patterns that indicate money laundering, helping you stay compliant and secure.
Ethical hackers test your system’s weaknesses through penetration testing. Bug bounty programs incentivize global experts to find and report vulnerabilities.Third-party audits provide credibility and peace of mind for your users, showing them your platform has been professionally vetted.
Not every employee should have god-mode access. Role-based access ensures that only authorized personnel can touch sensitive data.Every admin action should be logged. If something goes wrong, you need to know who did what, when.Scalability & Load Handling
As your user base grows, so does your attack surface. Your security strategy must scale in tandem with your architecture.Proper load balancing prevents overloads and ensures smooth user experiences even during traffic spikes.
Every interface must be secured individually. Mobile apps, web browsers, and APIs all present unique vulnerabilities.Implement platform-specific protections, such as mobile encryption layers and secure API gateways, for comprehensive defense.
Only collect what’s necessary. Less data means fewer points of attack.Staying compliant with regulations like GDPR isn’t optional; it’s essential for trust and legal safety.Why You Need a Reliable Partner like Justtry Technologies
Partnering with an expert  can give your platform a major head start with secure architecture and faster deployment.
Our Justtry Technologies brings deep domain expertise, pre-built solutions, and continuous support to secure your platform before and after launch. Also, a crypto exchange USA-based  
In the ever-evolving crypto landscape, security is not a luxury; it’s a necessity. From multi-layer authentication to secure scripts and compliance, every detail counts. Your platform’s future depends on the trust you earn today, like a crypto exchange clone script.
So, is your exchange built to protect not just digital assets, but also user confidence?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why SEO Services in the USA Are Vital for Your Business Growth</title><link>https://dev.to/mediasearch/why-seo-services-in-the-usa-are-vital-for-your-business-growth-129k</link><author>Media Search Group</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 09:18:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the modern world of digital and mobile the ability to rank on search engines is no longer just a nice thing to have, it's an absolute necessity.

Even with years of experience and valuable skills, an old-fashioned layout, vague language, or irrelevant content can keep you out of the running. Whether you're reentering the workforce, pivoting careers, or simply haven’t updated your resume in years, a modern redesign is essential to make a strong impression in today’s job market.The first step in modernizing your resume is updating the format. Traditional templates with dense paragraphs, decorative fonts, and overused borders no longer appeal to recruiters or pass through Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). Opt for a clean, minimalist layout that emphasizes clarity. Use modern fonts like Calibri or Helvetica, consistent spacing, and clear section headings. Keep the design functional and easy to scan—white space and bullet points go a long way in improving readability.Next, replace the outdated objective statement with a strong professional summary. Rather than stating what you hope to gain from a position, use this section to communicate your value. A compelling summary highlights your top achievements, core skills, and areas of expertise tailored to the specific job you’re applying for. Focus on what makes you unique and the results you've delivered in past roles.Modern resumes emphasize achievements over responsibilities. Instead of listing duties, shift your language to reflect results and impact. Use action verbs like "led," "designed," "implemented," or "increased," followed by specific outcomes. Quantify whenever possible—mention percentages, dollar amounts, or time saved to show the tangible effect of your work. This approach demonstrates your ability to deliver results, which resonates more with employers than generic task descriptions.Revise the content to reflect only the most relevant experience. If you’ve been working for over a decade, there’s no need to include every job from early in your career—especially if they don’t relate to your current goals. Focus on the last 10–15 years and the positions that align best with the role you’re pursuing. Remove outdated technologies, obsolete skills, and experience that no longer serves your narrative.Incorporate a modern skills section. Highlight both hard and soft skills, ensuring they match the job description. Break your skills into categories like “Technical Skills,” “Project Management,” or “Data Analysis” to make them easier to scan. If you've learned new tools, platforms, or technologies—especially those in demand in your industry—be sure to include them.Add sections that reflect current hiring trends. These may include certifications, industry awards, relevant projects, or links to professional profiles like LinkedIn or an online portfolio. Including URLs in the contact section gives hiring managers quick access to your digital presence, showcasing a well-rounded professional brand.If applicable, include remote or hybrid work experience. Since remote collaboration is now common across industries, employers value candidates who are already familiar with virtual tools and workflows. Specify your comfort level with platforms like Zoom, Slack, Trello, or other industry-specific systems.Review your language for clarity, modern tone, and inclusivity. Avoid jargon, clichés, and outdated corporate speak. Instead, aim for precise, confident statements that convey your strengths clearly. Check for grammatical consistency, including verb tenses and punctuation. Use present tense for current roles and past tense for previous ones.Lastly, ensure your resume is mobile- and ATS-friendly. Many recruiters view resumes on their phones, so a responsive, scannable layout is key. Avoid elements that ATS systems can’t interpret, such as columns, headers, footers, or text boxes. Save your file in .docx or PDF format, depending on what the job application specifies.A resume redesign isn't just cosmetic—it’s a strategic overhaul to align your professional story with today’s hiring standards. With an updated layout, powerful content, and relevant keywords, your resume can reflect not only who you were, but who you are now—and where you're ready to go. A modern, well-crafted resume helps you stand out and puts you in the best position to move forward with confidence.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Make Your Resume ATS-Friendly</title><link>https://dev.to/rac/how-to-make-your-resume-ats-friendly-ni9</link><author>Zack Rac</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 08:52:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As companies increasingly rely on technology to streamline the hiring process, understanding how to make your resume ATS-friendly is essential. ATS, or Applicant Tracking System, is software that helps employers filter and rank resumes before they are seen by a human. If your resume isn’t optimized for ATS, it may get rejected automatically—even if you're highly qualified. To bypass the digital gatekeeper, your resume must be formatted and written in a way that both the system and the hiring manager can easily understand.The first step to making your resume ATS-friendly is to use a clean, simple format. ATS software is designed to read text, not graphics. Avoid using complex layouts, images, tables, or text boxes, which can confuse the system or cause content to be skipped entirely. Stick to standard fonts like Arial, Times New Roman, or Calibri, and use clear headings such as “Work Experience,” “Education,” and “Skills.” Save your resume as a Word document (.doc or .docx) or a plain-text file (.txt), unless the job posting specifically asks for a PDF.Keywords are another critical element of an ATS-friendly resume. These are the specific words and phrases that match the job description. Carefully read the job posting and identify important skills, qualifications, and tools mentioned. Then, naturally incorporate those keywords throughout your resume, especially in your professional summary, skills list, and job descriptions. Using the right keywords increases the chances that your resume will rank highly in ATS searches.Structure your resume with clear, consistent formatting to make it easy for the ATS to parse. List your experiences in reverse chronological order, starting with your most recent job. For each position, include the job title, company name, location, and dates of employment on one line or in a standard pattern. Use bullet points to describe your responsibilities and achievements, and begin each bullet with a strong action verb to convey impact.When listing your skills, separate them into a dedicated section and use the exact terms that match the job requirements. For example, if a job listing asks for “project management software,” use that phrase directly rather than a variation like “project tools.” Also, include both acronyms and full terms when possible—for instance, write both “SEO” and “Search Engine Optimization”—to ensure compatibility with different types of ATS keyword recognition.Avoid using headers and footers, as some ATS systems cannot read the text within them. Place all relevant information in the main body of the document. Likewise, steer clear of unusual section titles such as “Career Highlights” or “Professional Snapshot.” Stick with conventional titles like “Summary,” “Experience,” and “Education” to ensure the ATS can categorize your information correctly.Don’t try to trick the system by stuffing your resume with keywords. ATS software is becoming more advanced and can detect irrelevant or repetitive use of terms. Focus on incorporating keywords in a meaningful and context-appropriate way, and back them up with measurable results and achievements that demonstrate your qualifications.If you have certifications, licenses, or technical proficiencies that are relevant to the job, list them clearly and separately. Many ATS systems have fields that specifically scan for certifications or tools, so it’s helpful to include a “Certifications” or “Technical Skills” section to increase your visibility.Lastly, test your resume by running it through an ATS resume checker or pasting it into a plain text editor to see how it appears without formatting. This can help you identify any parts that may not translate well and ensure your content remains readable.Making your resume ATS-friendly is not just about getting past the software—it’s about ensuring your best qualifications are seen by a real person. With the right structure, keywords, and attention to detail, you can significantly improve your chances of landing interviews and moving one step closer to your ideal job.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Boosting Your Academic Integrity with AI Citation Tools</title><link>https://dev.to/researchwize/boosting-your-academic-integrity-with-ai-citation-tools-5gfj</link><author>ResearchWize</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 08:32:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ Custom header & fresh rewrite for Dev.to readers.

Unlike static portfolio allocation, dynamic portfolio optimization requires continuous adjustments to asset holdings in real-time, contending with high dimensionality, inherent non-linearity, and the ever-changing, volatile nature of market conditions. Factors such as transaction costs, liquidity constraints, and an investor's evolving risk profile further complicate the decision-making process. Traditional optimization methods often fall short in capturing these complex, time-varying dynamics, leading to sub-optimal returns and increased risk exposure. This article explores a cutting-edge solution: a hybrid framework that synergizes the bio-inspired Jellyfish Search Optimizer (JSO) with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to create an adaptive and robust approach to dynamic investment portfolio management.
  
  
  The Jellyfish Search Optimizer (JSO): A Bio-Inspired Metaheuristic
The Jellyfish Search Optimizer (JSO) is a relatively new metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the mesmerizing behavior of jellyfish in the ocean, specifically their food-finding movements. As detailed in "Recent advances in use of bio-inspired jellyfish search algorithm for solving optimization problems" published in , JSO mimics two primary movement patterns: following ocean currents and moving within a jellyfish swarm.Ocean Current Movement (Exploration): Jellyfish are drawn to ocean currents because they carry abundant nutrients. This movement simulates the global exploration phase of the algorithm, where the search space is broadly explored to identify promising regions.Swarm Movement (Exploitation): Within a swarm, jellyfish exhibit both passive and active movements, gradually converging towards areas with higher food concentrations. This represents the exploitation phase, where the algorithm refines solutions within promising regions. A crucial aspect of JSO is its time control mechanism, which dynamically balances exploration and exploitation throughout the optimization process. Initially, exploration is prioritized to discover diverse solutions, and as time progresses, exploitation becomes more dominant to fine-tune the best solutions found.JSO's advantages lie in its simplicity, rapid convergence, and a commendable balance between exploration and exploitation, making it well-suited for complex, high-dimensional optimization landscapes where traditional gradient-based methods might struggle.

  Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for Financial Markets
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for sequential decision-making in dynamic environments, making it highly relevant for financial applications. In finance, DRL agents learn optimal trading and portfolio management strategies by interacting directly with the market environment. The agent observes the market state, takes actions (e.g., buying, selling, holding assets), and receives rewards (e.g., profits, Sharpe ratio improvements) or penalties (e.g., losses, high transaction costs). Through this continuous feedback loop, DRL algorithms like Deep Q-Networks (DQN) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) can learn to maximize cumulative returns while adhering to specified risk constraints.DRL's ability to process vast amounts of raw financial data (e.g., price movements, volume, news sentiment) through deep neural networks allows it to uncover intricate, non-linear relationships and adapt to evolving market patterns. However, DRL in finance faces challenges such as sample inefficiency, difficulty in exploring large state-action spaces, and the risk of converging to sub-optimal local optima, especially in highly volatile markets. A comprehensive review of DRL in finance can be found in "Deep Reinforcement Learning in Finance: A Review" on arXiv.org.
  
  
  The Hybrid JSO-DRL Framework: A Synergistic Approach
The motivation behind combining JSO and DRL stems from their complementary strengths. DRL excels at learning adaptive strategies in dynamic environments, but its performance is highly sensitive to hyperparameter tuning and can suffer from local optima traps. JSO, with its strong global search capabilities and efficient balance of exploration and exploitation, can effectively address these DRL limitations.Proposed Architecture (Conceptual):The hybrid JSO-DRL framework operates in a multi-phase manner:Phase 1: JSO-Enhanced DRL Hyperparameter Tuning: JSO can be employed as a meta-optimizer to search for the optimal hyperparameters of the DRL agent, such as the learning rate, discount factor, neural network architecture (number of layers, neurons), and activation functions. This initial phase ensures that the DRL agent starts its learning process with a highly optimized configuration.Phase 2: JSO-Guided Exploration/Exploitation: During the DRL training process, JSO can periodically intervene to guide the DRL agent's exploration. If the DRL agent appears to be stuck in a local optimum (e.g., plateauing performance), JSO can introduce perturbations to its policy or explore new, potentially overlooked state-action spaces. This prevents premature convergence and encourages the DRL agent to discover more globally optimal strategies.Phase 3: Adaptive Strategy Refinement: The DRL agent continuously learns and refines its portfolio allocation strategy based on real-time market feedback. JSO acts as an intermittent "meta-optimizer," monitoring the DRL agent's long-term performance and re-tuning its parameters or re-initiating exploration if signs of stagnation or performance degradation are detected.
  
  
  Potential Advantages of the Hybrid Approach
The integration of JSO and DRL offers several compelling advantages for dynamic investment portfolio optimization: JSO's robust exploration capabilities can help the DRL agent navigate complex financial environments more effectively, preventing it from getting trapped in sub-optimal local optima.Improved Hyperparameter Optimization: Automating the tuning of DRL hyperparameters using JSO can lead to more robust and higher-performing DRL agents, reducing the need for manual trial-and-error.Adaptability and Robustness: The continuous interaction between JSO and DRL allows the system to adapt more quickly and robustly to changing market conditions, volatility, and unforeseen events.Potentially Faster Convergence: By guiding the DRL agent's learning process and preventing stagnation, JSO can potentially accelerate the convergence of DRL training to superior portfolio strategies. The hybrid model leverages JSO's ability to perform a global search across the DRL's parameter or policy space, leading to more optimal overall solutions.
  
  
  Challenges and Future Directions
Despite its promising potential, the JSO-DRL hybrid approach presents several challenges:Increased Computational Complexity: The nested optimization process, where JSO optimizes DRL, significantly increases computational demands, requiring substantial processing power and time. Designing effective and comprehensive reward functions for DRL in finance remains a critical challenge. The reward function must accurately reflect investment goals (e.g., risk-adjusted returns, drawdown control) and account for real-world complexities like transaction costs and market impact.High-Frequency Data and Real-time Execution: Implementing such a complex model for high-frequency trading or real-time execution requires extremely efficient algorithms and infrastructure to handle massive data streams and rapid decision-making. Hybrid models, especially those involving deep learning, can be opaque. Understanding  the model makes certain portfolio decisions can be difficult, posing challenges for risk management and regulatory compliance.Generalizability and Testing: Thorough testing across diverse financial instruments, market regimes (bull, bear, volatile, stable), and economic conditions is crucial to validate the model's generalizability and robustness. Further research could explore its application to different asset classes (e.g., cryptocurrencies, commodities) and more complex portfolio constraints.The dynamic nature of financial markets necessitates advanced optimization techniques for effective portfolio management. The proposed hybrid approach, combining the global search prowess of the Jellyfish Search Optimizer with the adaptive learning capabilities of Deep Reinforcement Learning, offers a novel and powerful framework to address the inherent complexities of real-time investment decisions. By synergizing their strengths, this bio-inspired computational intelligence model holds significant promise for enhancing portfolio performance, improving adaptability to market shifts, and ultimately revolutionizing the landscape of dynamic investment management. While challenges related to computational cost, interpretability, and robust reward design remain, this hybrid JSO-DRL framework opens exciting avenues for future research and practical applications in the evolving world of algorithmic finance.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Real-World UI Problem You Can’t Ignore”</title><link>https://dev.to/swetty_sultania_834f90237/a-real-world-ui-problem-you-cant-ignore-4cio</link><author>Nuro Design</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 08:00:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[🧩 “Why Do Users Rage Click?

To mitigate this challenge, you can use intelligent techniques such as AI unit test generation.With AI unit test generation, you can streamline the process of writing unit test scripts by automating test creation, reducing manual effort, and enhancing your overall testing process.AI unit test generation is the process of using artificial intelligence to automatically create unit test scripts for software applications.Instead of manually writing test cases for unit testing, AI tools analyze the the logic, structure, and behavior of the code to identify key functions, edge cases, and potential failure points. Based on this analysis, they generate unit tests that include inputs, expected outputs, and assertions.When unit tests are generated through artificial intelligence, the team reaps the following benefits, impacting the method and quality of software development process.  Test cases generated through AI cover a wider range, as the goal of the software is to cover all aspects of the functionality. This includes edge cases as well that testers often overlook.  AI unit test generation targets each line of code, even if the tests may become more complex. This results in better test coverage and, therefore, a better unit test suite.  AI-based unit testing can automatically modify the unit test scripts when the codebase is changed or updated, so you do not need to maintain these tests.  When AI is deployed to generate unit tests, you have more time to invest in code enhancement or work on other functionalities.  Since you invest time in other development tasks, this can be directly associated with costs that have a visible ROI. AI unit test generation, therefore, becomes a great way for the team to save costs in unit testing.Generating unit tests using AI requires integration between machine learning models and software testing processes. At a higher level, a framework is designed whose high-level components look as follows:Large Language Model Configuration and Integration: To work on AI technology, an LLM model is required. This model is tuned and fed according to the tasks it will perform. The team and the organization decide which model to choose.
The model automates the generation of unit test scripts in the desired programming language. It can also have additional functionalities, such as prioritizing functions and providing options to regenerate tests if required. However, these are considered enhancements rather than core requirements. The integrated LLM model generates test scripts and saves them in a separate file with extensions that match the targeted programming language. In this stage, the tests generated in the previous stage are executed. This stage also connects with the reporting module, where the test results are documented automatically.Analysis and Regeneration: The final results are presented to the tester, and if regeneration is required, the model has to be run again. Here, there can be multiple modifications according to the tester’s requirements.
For instance, the tester can run a different model to see if it generates better output. If the framework is designed autonomously, all these options can also be chosen automatically.This is a generic framework design for AI unit test generation. You can also add other modules to make it more productive and efficient, depending on their requirements. However, the stated modules have to be present as a foundation.To make effective use of AI for unit testing, there are some strategies that you can follow:  Use AI to generate realistic synthetic test data. This type of data covers a variety of test cases and may be used to assess how a software application will behave across a variety of conditions.  Define specific goals for your AI unit testing efforts. Also, defined objectives to ensure a focused and structured testing approach, targeting key areas effectively.  Test individual components in isolation to unearth issues within specific units. It will make your debugging simpler and efficient.  Adopt a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, where you first write automated tests, then develop the code required to pass those tests.
By doing so, you can have a good understanding of the expected behavior of all the components of the software application, and at the same time, your test scripts will cover all functionality from the beginning. It also makes it easier to find and fix issues quickly during the development process.  Besides leveraging AI, integrate your test suites with CI/CD tools. This way, the tests will execute on each code commit, keeping high code quality and ensuring faster bug detection.Unit tests can be generated automatically through AI using the following tools.KaneAI is a GenAI native end-to-end test assistant for high-speed quality engineering teams. It is built on modern LLMs, where you can write test steps in natural language command instructions.It can be used to generate unit tests using high-level objectives or tags through third-party software such as Jira, Slack, and GitHub, and debug errors automatically. The unit tests generated here can be integrated with the CI/CD pipeline for enhanced testing.Once tests are generated, they need to be run and managed regularly. You can look for tools that do more than just basic input-output tasks, and that’s where LambdaTest’s AI-native Test Manager comes in.With LambdaTest Test Manager, you get everything in one place — test case creation, management, execution, and reporting. You can create test cases manually or use AI to speed things up.ChatGPT is one of the most popular GenAI tools. It takes English-based prompts (test steps) and generate unit tests.     It helps you with code explanation, refactoring, debugging, and optimization. It supports multiple programming paradigms, such as object-oriented and functional programming, tailoring responses based on user requirements.Claude is an AI assistant built by Anthropic, working on Generative AI technology similar to ChatGPT. It takes input from the user and presents the output after analysis. For AI unit test generation, the input can be the instructions to generate unit tests.Similar to ChatGPT, it comes in free and paid versions. The free version has limited features and a reduced model performance compared to the paid version. The tool is more inclined towards code generation, which makes it a good choice for automatically generating unit tests.GitHub Copilot is an AI unit test generation tool that seamlessly integrates into Visual Studio Code and provides multiple model options for interaction.It can take multiple programming files as input and update all of them based on the input provided. Therefore, when unit test generation is required, you need not worry about finding the context of multiple files to edit, which ultimately saves a lot of time.Diffblue Cover helps you generate unit tests, specifically in Java. It can be integrated into IntelliJ and CI pipelines, generating automatic unit tests by understanding the code in the files and covering all the edge cases.It monitors the code files for which the unit tests were generated, and when any change is found, the unit test cases are automatically adjusted accordingly. In addition, this AI unit test generation tool can provide test coverage details in a visual format.Workik is an AI-powered platform that simplifies the software development process by automating various tasks, including unit test generation. It has an AI-driven unit test case generator that generates test cases for multiple programming languages.It provides a VS Code extension that enables effortless test case generation and debugging assistance within the code editor.Functionize is an AI-powered testing platform that leverages machine learning to automate test creation and reduce the need for manual test creation.It can detect and fix issues on its own, so you don’t have to spend time troubleshooting. With Generative AI, Functionize also generates a variety of test cases, making regression testing more thorough and keeping software stable.Bito is an AI-driven coding assistant that streamlines your development process by automating test generation and code reviews. It integrates seamlessly into your development lifecycle, automatically generating and updating unit tests to achieve 100% code coverage.Its capabilities extend to generating function/method tests, including boundary and edge cases. This enhances code reliability and reduces the time developers spend writing tests.UnitTestBot is an IntelliJ plugin that generates tests and human-readable test descriptions. The test cases generated through UTBot do not require manual intervention. They are “ready to use” with valid inputs, method bodies, assertions, and comments.The rest of everything is taken care of by the tool. UTBot also claims to find hidden bugs in the source code with a 0 rate of false positives. It means all the hidden bugs it finds are indeed real and would have impacted the application at some time. This is a great feature to increase the test coverage and enhance the application’s quality.Windsurf is an AI-powered extension available for popular IDEs such as JetBrains, VS Code, Eclipse, Visual Studio, and Xcode.It can be used to interact with the code editor and generate unit tests in simple English. However, instead of automatically generating the tests, the tester has to specify the method name using “@,” and the tool can only generate 60–70% of the tests.Though AI unit test generation can help optimize your testing process but it comes with a few challenges:  AI models heavily rely on large volumes of high-quality data for training and decision-making. However, gathering and curating such data is often more difficult than it seems. If the data is insufficient or of low quality, it can result in incorrect predictions and reduce the effectiveness of the AI model.  Some AI models — especially those based on deep learning can make it hard to understand how they reach their conclusions. So, this lack of transparency can lead to mistrust, especially when the model makes predictions that turn out to be wrong or unexpected.  AI models may sometimes report defects that don’t exist (false positives) or miss real ones (false negatives). These issues can lead to wasted effort or overlooked bugs, reducing the overall testing efficiency.  You also need to frequently maintain and update AI models to retain their effectiveness when scaling software applications. Without proper efforts towards updates and maintenance, such models can quickly lose their respective relevance and turn out to be outdated.Unit tests play an important role in reducing bugs, maintenance time, and all the costs associated with these processes. They can point out bugs at specific locations at the start of the cycle and perfect each module as the code base increases.However, with strict deadlines and shorter timelines, unit testing does get sidelined, often completing the test cases for formalities and writing them according to the methods so that they do not fail and consume more time.While we cannot shorten the time it takes to write test scripts for the feature, we can leverage AI to generate unit tests automatically, and need not worry about maintaining them in the long run.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Elevating Customer Retention with Real-Time Engagement Strategies</title><link>https://dev.to/plgosblogs/elevating-customer-retention-with-real-time-engagement-strategies-294e</link><author>PLGOSBlogs</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 07:27:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The power of customer engagement strategies lies in the ability to respond quickly to real-time behaviors and needs.

Whether you're a startup launching your first chatbot or a large enterprise integrating conversational AI into complex systems, your hosting choice will impact performance, security, cost, and scalability.
Botpress is known for its flexibility, particularly when compared to many off-the-shelf chatbot platforms. You’re not confined to a proprietary ecosystem. Instead, Botpress gives you the freedom to deploy locally, in the cloud, or as a SaaS product, depending on your business needs, regulatory environment, and technical infrastructure.In this blog, we’ll explore the three primary hosting options for Botpress AI chatbot development Local, Cloud, and SaaS discussing their strengths, limitations, and ideal use cases to help you make the best decision for your organization. Whether you're focused on AI development, web development, app development, or custom software development, choosing the right hosting setup is key to chatbot success.
Local Hosting: Full Control and On-Premise Security
Local hosting involves running the Botpress server on your own infrastructure. This means setting up Botpress on a local machine, private server, or internal data center. For organizations prioritizing data privacy, compliance, or system-level control, local hosting is often the default choice.
In custom software development environments where sensitive data is handled such as finance, government, or healthcare local hosting ensures that data never leaves the organization's network. This is particularly important for companies bound by regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or ISO standards.A major benefit of local hosting is the level of customization it offers. You can tailor system performance, memory allocation, database configurations, and logging mechanisms to suit your specific use case. Additionally, updates and changes happen on your timeline.
However, local hosting demands technical resources. You’ll need server administration skills, DevOps knowledge, and possibly support from a Botpress AI chatbot development company to ensure proper deployment, security patches, and scalability.
Cloud Hosting: Flexibility and Scalability
Cloud hosting involves deploying Botpress on cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure. This option is ideal for businesses that require scalability, availability, and easier remote access without the hassle of managing physical infrastructure.In the context of web development or app development, cloud hosting provides reliable uptime and global reach. Bots hosted in the cloud can scale automatically during traffic spikes, which is essential for applications that handle high volumes of concurrent users. It also offers integration with other cloud services like storage, databases, monitoring tools, and advanced AI services.
Cloud hosting supports advanced AI development needs, especially when integrating large language models or machine learning tools that consume significant resources. It also allows easier collaboration between distributed teams who may need shared access to bot configurations and analytics.The downside? You’re still responsible for managing the cloud instance. While infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) options make things easier, you’ll need to monitor usage, handle backups, maintain uptime, and implement security protocols. A Botpress AI chatbot development company can streamline this by setting up CI/CD pipelines, automated monitoring, and secure deployment environments tailored to your business needs.SaaS Hosting: Convenience Without the Complexity
For teams looking for speed, simplicity, and minimal maintenance, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) hosting is a compelling option. Botpress Cloud, the platform’s official managed hosting service, takes care of everything—from installation and upgrades to security and scalability.SaaS hosting allows businesses to focus solely on chatbot development without worrying about the backend. For startups and SMEs with limited technical resources, SaaS makes Botpress AI chatbot development as easy as logging into a web portal, creating conversation flows, and going live in a matter of hours.
This model is great for teams involved in app development or web development projects that require rapid prototyping and iteration. SaaS hosting also often includes built-in analytics, integrations, and automatic scaling features.However, the trade-off is reduced control. Custom modules, external API integrations, and system-level configurations may be limited or subject to vendor terms. Additionally, SaaS platforms often operate on subscription models that can become expensive over time, especially at scale.
For companies requiring extensive customization or that are concerned about data ownership, a more hands-on hosting approach either local or cloud may be more appropriate.Comparison Summary

That’s not just a dream, it’s the reality for teams who have embraced AI code tools, but only if they take the crucial step of training AI on their own codebase. As a CTO or Product Engineering Manager, you’re already juggling speed, quality, and security. The question is: are you ready to unlock the next level of software excellence with AI code reviews that truly understand your context?
  
  
  Why Custom AI Code Reviews Matter
Modern software teams face a paradox: codebases are growing faster than our ability to review them thoroughly. Traditional code reviews are essential for quality and code security, but they’re also a bottleneck. AI code tools promise to automate and accelerate these reviews — flagging bugs, enforcing style, and even spotting security vulnerabilities.But here’s the catch: generic AI models often miss the nuances of your codebase. They can’t “see” your architecture, your business logic, or your team’s conventions. Even the most advanced Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) fail when tasks get complex: they pattern-match, not truly reason.
  
  
  The Limits of AI “Thinking” in Code Review
Recent research shows that today’s LLMs excel at simple, pattern-based checks: formatting, linting, basic syntax, and common security flaws. But when it comes to high-context, high-complexity issues like architectural decisions, business logic, or nuanced security policies, AI’s “thinking” breaks down.This isn’t just theoretical. In practice, code review isn’t just about the code in front of you. It’s about understanding the system’s history, business intent, and team norms. Human reviewers connect these dots; AI, without help, can’t.
  
  
  How to Customize AI Code Reviews for Real Results
So, how do you make AI code reviews work for your team? Here’s what I’ve learned from building and using Panto AI:Index Your Codebase and Context: Don’t just feed the model code. Index your architecture diagrams, design docs, Jira tickets, and commit history. This gives the AI the context it needs to make relevant suggestions. Feed the model your coding guidelines, security policies, and team conventions. This ensures it’s not just flagging generic issues, but enforcing your standards.Integrate Classical Tools: Use static analysis, linters, and security scanners alongside the AI. Let the AI focus on the high-level, contextual issues, while deterministic tools handle the basics. Track which AI suggestions your team accepts or rejects. Use this feedback to refine the model’s understanding over time.This approach of enriching the AI’s context and combining it with classical analysis is what makes AI code tools truly effective.
  
  
  The Business Value of Custom AI Code Reviews
Customizing AI for your codebase isn’t just a technical win; it’s a business enabler:Faster, More Consistent Reviews: AI-assisted reviews can cut review time by a third or more, letting your team ship faster without sacrificing quality.

While these "black box" AI systems deliver remarkable capabilities, their intricate internal workings often remain opaque, making it challenging to understand their real-time performance, decision-making logic, and potential biases. This opacity, often termed the "black box problem," carries significant consequences: unexpected behaviors leading to system failures, performance degradation impacting user experience, biased decisions causing ethical dilemmas, and ultimately, substantial financial losses.AI observability emerges as the critical solution to this challenge. It's not merely about monitoring basic system health; it demands continuous, high-fidelity insights into a myriad of AI-specific metrics. This includes tracking model accuracy, inference latency, confidence scores, input/output data distributions, and resource utilization. Without a clear window into these evolving metrics, diagnosing issues, optimizing performance, and ensuring the reliability and fairness of AI systems becomes an arduous, often reactive, task. As highlighted in "Seeing Through the Fog: AI Observability with Time Series Databases" on Medium, understanding these patterns over time is crucial for effective AI management.
  
  
  Why Traditional Databases Fall Short for AI Time-Series Data
The unique demands of AI observability, particularly the need to handle vast volumes of timestamped data, quickly expose the limitations of traditional database systems:Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS): While excellent for structured, transactional data with well-defined schemas, RDBMS like PostgreSQL struggle with the high-frequency, append-only nature of time-series data. Their design prioritizes ACID compliance, leading to poor write performance when ingesting millions of data points per minute. Furthermore, their indexing strategies are not optimized for sequential time-based queries across large datasets, and their schema rigidity makes it difficult to adapt to the constantly evolving metrics of AI models. Document stores such as MongoDB offer schema flexibility, which is beneficial for evolving data structures. However, they typically lack the time-series specific optimizations found in purpose-built databases. This results in inefficient storage, as generic compression algorithms don't leverage the predictable patterns in time-series data, and slower query performance for time-based aggregations and range queries. As noted by Timescale, specialized time-series databases can achieve significantly better compression ratios (e.g., 90-95% storage reduction) compared to general-purpose NoSQL solutions.The core issue is that traditional databases are not architected to efficiently manage the "volume, velocity, and variability" inherent in time-series data. This is where Time-Series Databases (TSDBs) step in, offering a specialized solution tailored for chronological data.
  
  
  The Technical Anatomy of AI Observability with TSDBs
Time-Series Databases are purpose-built to store, retrieve, and analyze data points indexed by time. Their architecture is fundamentally different, allowing them to excel where traditional databases falter in AI observability.The foundation of effective AI observability lies in robust data collection. AI agents and models must be instrumented to emit a continuous stream of relevant metrics. This includes: How long it takes for the model to process an input and return a prediction. The model's internal confidence in its predictions.Input/Output Distributions: Changes in the characteristics of the data flowing into and out of the model, which can indicate data drift. CPU, GPU, memory, and network usage during inference. Accuracy, precision, recall, feature importance weights, attention patterns in transformer models, and token consumption rates for LLMs.Here's a Python snippet illustrating how a simple AI inference might capture metrics ready for ingestion into a TSDB:These metrics, each with a precise timestamp, form the time-series data stream that TSDBs are designed to handle.
  
  
  Storage Layer Architecture
TSDBs employ specialized architectures to manage massive volumes of time-series data efficiently: Time-series data is largely immutable and always appended, making TSDBs optimized for high write throughput. Data is organized by metric (column) rather than by row, which allows for highly efficient compression and faster analytical queries on specific metrics.Specialized Compression Algorithms: TSDBs use techniques like delta encoding, Gorilla compression, and run-length encoding to achieve significant storage reductions (often 10x or more) by leveraging the sequential and often repetitive nature of time-series data.Hot-Warm-Cold Storage Tiers: Data is automatically moved between different storage tiers based on its age. Recent, "hot" data resides on fast storage for quick access, while older, "cold" data is moved to cheaper, highly compressed storage for long-term retention. This ensures cost-effectiveness while maintaining data accessibility for historical analysis.
  
  
  Time-Series Database Advantages for AI
The architectural choices of TSDBs translate into several key advantages for AI observability:High Ingestion Rates and Query Performance: TSDBs are built for speed, enabling them to ingest millions of data points per second and execute time-based queries (e.g., aggregations over specific time windows) with sub-second latency.Efficient Data Compression: As mentioned, their specialized compression algorithms drastically reduce storage footprint, making it economically feasible to store years of high-resolution AI telemetry.Built-in Time-Based Functions: TSDBs offer native functions for common time-series operations like  for aggregation, / for retrieving specific values within a time window, downsampling for reducing data resolution over time, and retention policies for automated data lifecycle management.Handling High Cardinality: AI systems can generate millions of unique time series due to various dimensions (e.g., model version, agent ID, user session, geographic region). TSDBs are engineered to handle this "cardinality explosion" without significant performance degradation, unlike many traditional databases. While not as schema-less as some NoSQL databases, many modern TSDBs offer sufficient flexibility to add new metrics and dimensions dynamically as AI models evolve, without requiring disruptive schema migrations. This is crucial for agile AI development and experimentation.
  
  
  Practical AI Observability Use Cases
With TSDBs as their backbone, AI observability platforms can unlock a wealth of insights: Track critical metrics like inference latency, throughput, and resource consumption (CPU, GPU, memory). This allows for real-time identification of bottlenecks and performance regressions. For example, a sudden spike in latency for a specific model version might indicate a problem with a recent deployment. Monitor the statistical properties of model inputs, outputs, and internal states over time. Subtle shifts in data distributions or confidence scores can signal model drift, where the model's performance degrades due to changes in the real-world data it encounters. TSDBs excel at identifying these gradual, time-dependent anomalies. Pinpoint unusual patterns that deviate significantly from learned baselines. This can indicate various issues, from model errors and data corruption to cyberattacks or unexpected external events impacting the AI system.Multi-Agent Orchestration: Correlate metrics across multiple interacting AI agents to understand complex causal chains and emergent behaviors. In systems where different AI components collaborate, observing their synchronized or asynchronous metrics in a TSDB can reveal how one agent's behavior influences another, providing a holistic view of the AI ecosystem.Here's a simplified SQL query, conceptually similar to what you might use with InfluxDB or TimescaleDB, to find the average latency for a specific AI agent over the last hour:This type of query, optimized for time-series data, allows engineers to quickly drill down into specific periods and agents to diagnose issues.
  
  
  Choosing the Right TSDB for AI Observability
Selecting the appropriate TSDB is crucial for building a robust AI observability stack. Popular choices, each with its strengths, include: A strong contender, especially for high-ingestion rate scenarios. It offers its own query language (Flux and InfluxQL) and is known for its performance and scalability. Built as an extension on PostgreSQL, it offers the familiarity and power of SQL while providing specialized features for time-series data, including automatic partitioning, columnar compression, and continuous aggregates. This makes it a good choice for those already invested in the PostgreSQL ecosystem or who prefer SQL for complex analytics and joining time-series data with other relational data. A fast, cost-effective, and scalable monitoring solution that is Prometheus-compatible. It excels at handling high cardinality and large volumes of metrics. While primarily a monitoring and alerting toolkit, Prometheus includes a built-in TSDB optimized for system and application metrics. It's widely adopted in cloud-native environments and integrates well with Kubernetes, though it's not a general-purpose TSDB and might require federation for long-term storage at scale.For visualization,  stands out as a powerful and flexible open-source platform that integrates seamlessly with most TSDBs. It allows for the creation of rich, interactive dashboards that can bring AI observability metrics to life, enabling real-time insights and historical trend analysis. For a deeper dive into the nuances of these databases, resources like "The Best Time-Series Databases Compared" by Timescale offer valuable insights.To further understand the foundational concepts of these databases, exploring resources that delve into understanding time-series databases can provide a comprehensive overview of their architecture and benefits.
  
  
  The Future: TSDBs and Vector Databases for Advanced AI Analytics
The frontier of AI observability is rapidly expanding, with an emerging trend of combining TSDBs with vector databases. As AI models increasingly rely on embeddings (numerical representations of data like text, images, or audio), the ability to store and query these high-dimensional vectors becomes paramount.Vector databases, such as Milvus, are optimized for similarity search on these embeddings. By integrating TSDBs with vector databases, organizations can:Perform Semantic Search on AI Logs/Traces: Instead of just keyword-matching logs, engineers can search for semantically similar patterns in AI system behavior by vectorizing log entries and querying them.Analyze Model Embeddings Over Time: Track how a model's internal representations (embeddings) evolve or drift over time, offering deeper insights into model stability and potential issues.Enhance Anomaly Detection: Combine time-series metrics with vector similarity searches on embeddings to detect more sophisticated anomalies that might not be apparent from numerical metrics alone. For instance, an unusual pattern in image embeddings combined with a spike in inference latency could signal a specific type of model failure.This synergy, explored in articles like "Improving Analytics with Time Series and Vector Databases" by Zilliz, represents the next wave in AI observability, enabling even more sophisticated and granular analysis of complex AI systems. As AI continues to permeate every industry, the role of specialized databases like TSDBs, and their integration with emerging technologies, will be indispensable in unlocking the black box and ensuring the reliable, transparent, and ethical operation of next-generation AI.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Integrate AI Models with Node.js Using Genkit</title><link>https://dev.to/maikelev/how-to-integrate-ai-models-with-nodejs-using-genkit-5807</link><author>Maikelev</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 03:54:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this tutorial, we'll use Gemini's gemini-2.5-flash model to implement two key functionalities.Bidirectional Translation: Translate text between English and Spanish (and vice versa).: Refine and optimize the quality of a given text.Check the supported models from Genkit to explore other AI models you can integrate into your projects.Google's open-source framework for integrating AI into your projects, acting as an AI wrapper with extended functionalities.Genkit.dev: Before we start with the code, it's crucial to understand that Genkit operates exclusively in server environments (such as Node.js, Cloud Functions, etc.). Currently, there are no SDKs or methods for its direct client-side implementation.We'll start by setting up our project's basic structure and installing the necessary dependencies:ia-translate
ia-translate
npm init 
npm genkit @genkit-ai/googleai dotenv

  
  
  2) Install additional dependencies
npm cors express zod

Using a basic API, I was able to create a MCP server that allowed me to call Australian Football League (AFL) data and supply that as context to LLMs so I can ask it question about AFL results, teams, stats etc. using that API.That blog post talked about how we can use MCP servers that run locally on our machines using  transport. In this article, I'll talk about how we can use  (SSE) transport to build remote MCP servers that we can host on Azure Container Apps.
  
  
  What are MCP servers again?
Model Context Protocol, or MCP for short, is an open protocol that standardizes how applications can provide context to LLMs. MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools to help us build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs.When we use LLMs, they'll need to integrate with a variety of different tools and data sources. MCP provides a list of pre-built integrations that we can integrate with LLMs. It also gives us the flexibility to change between different LLMs and different vendors (so from GPT to Deepseek for example).
  
  
  How do remote MCP servers work?
Currently, MCP defines two standard transport mechanisms for client-server communication:, which is communication over standard in and standard out.For remote servers, Streamable HTTP transport allows the server to operate as an independent process that can handle multiple client connections.Streamable HTTP uses HTTP POST and GET requests, along with  (SSE) to stream multiple server messages.For this to work, our MCP servers must provide an HTTP endpoint that supports both POST and GET methods. Thankfully, the C# SDK provides a package called ModelContextProtocol.AspNetCore that we can use to scaffold this capability.In this article, I'm just going to go through the basics of deploying my MCP server to Azure Container Apps. I'll go into more detail in a future post on how we can implement security to ensure that our MCP servers don't get abused!To read more about how the Streamable HTTP transport mechanism works in MCP, check out the documentation.
  
  
  Using the ModelContextProtocol.AspNetCore package
The MCP C# SDK provides the ModelContextProcotol.AspNetCore package that enables .NET applications to implement MCP server capabilities. Installing the NuGet package can be done using the dotnet cli like so:dotnet add package ModelContextProtocol.AspNetCore N.B - At the time of writing, I'm using version 0.2.0-preview.3This will give us the extension we need to build our remote MCP server using the Streamable HTTP transport mechanism. With the NuGet package installed, we can set up our  class like so:There's two important blocks of code that we need to examine here:In this block, we're registering the MCP server and its dependencies into our application's dependency injection container.The  method configures the server to use HTTP as its transport mechanism, meaning that we'll be able to communicate with it over HTTP POST and GET. The  method is the same as before when we used  transport, as it just registers the tools that we've defined in our application to the MCP server.The other important line of code is this one:This extension will set up the HTTP endpoints required for our remote MCP server. We can dive into the definition of this extension method using the  key in VS Code:There's quite a bit to unpack here, so let's break this down: starts by retrieving the  from the dependency injection container. It'll throw an exception if we haven't registered our MCP Server with HTTP Transport. If we have registered the required services in our DI container, it'll create a route group using the provided pattern (or an empty string default) for the base path for all MCP endpoints.Within this route group,  endpoints are created to map the POST endpoints to handle incoming requests to our MCP server, accepting JSON requests and producing either  for streaming responses or standard accepted responses.There's also a conditional check based on the  configuration option. In Stateful mode, additional  and  endpoints are mapped for the streamable HTTP handler. The  enables server-initiated communication through streaming, and the  endpoint allows clients to clean up server-side resources.There's also conditional mapping for legacy  with  when our server is not in  mode, which includes a dedicated  endpoint for handling  connections and a  endpoint for sending messages.The method returns an IEndpointConventionBuilder to allow us to chain additional configuration such as authorization policies, CORS settings, or any other endpoint conventions we want to add.
  
  
  Deploying to Azure Container Apps
With our application code taken care off, we can containerize our MCP server just like we would with any other ASP.NET Core application through a :dotnet restore dotnet build  /app/build

dotnet publish  /app/publish /p:UseAppHostOur application will be exposed on port , so in our Bicep code for our MCP server, we need to make sure our Container App's will accept incoming traffic on port 8080:resource mcpServer 'Microsoft.App/containerApps@2025-01-01' = {

Deploying an MCP server to Azure Container Apps isn't any different to any other type of application. To see the full code sample (Both C# and Bicep), check out my repository on GitHub.I use GitHub Actions to deploy the sample, and hopefully you'll see that apart from setting up the endpoints in our MCP server app, there's no extra configuration that we need to do to host our remote server on Azure Container Apps, or any other platform (such as Azure Functions or App Service).
  
  
  Testing our remote MCP server
Once our MCP Server has been deployed, we can interact with it using an MCP client, like Visual Studio Code.N.B - I know, asking GitHub Copilot in VS Code for AFL data seems strange. It's just a demo at the end of the day. Imagine I'm using an MCP server for Azure DevOps, or MS Docs, and you'll appreciate why this functionality is handy.To add our MCP Server to Visual Studio Code, press  and run the  command. Choose HTTP (Server-sent events) as the transport and enter the URL of your Container App with the  endpoint on the server.VS Code will then add the MCP server to the  configuration file. It should look something like the following:Next to the server in the JSON file, click  and your MCP server should be connected to the server.Open up GitHub Copilot chat, and you can start interacting with your MCP server in  Mode. Let's see how Carlton () did in the AFL last year:When we ask our question, GitHub Copilot chat will use the GetStandingsByRoundAndYear tool on our AFL MCP Server, and use the data it retrieves as context to answer our question. Press  to use the tool, and we get the following response from GitHub Copilot:Hopefully after reading this article you have a better understanding on how we can build and host remote MCP servers using the ModelContextProtocol.AspNetCore package in the MCP C# SDK and then host our servers on a PaaS service like Azure Container Apps.We haven't even touched on security yet, which is  important for implementing MCP servers. At the time of writing, work is being done on Authorization support in the C# SDK. In a future article, I'll discuss how we can secure our MCP servers to prevent misuse.If you have any questions about this, please feel free to reach out to me on BlueSky! I'm loving BlueSky at the moment. It has a much better UX and performance than Twitter these days.Until next time, Happy coding! 🤓🖥️]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Semantic Synergy: How Knowledge Graphs and LLMs are Reshaping the Future of the Web</title><link>https://dev.to/vaib/the-semantic-synergy-how-knowledge-graphs-and-llms-are-reshaping-the-future-of-the-web-1e4g</link><author>Coder</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 02:01:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The convergence of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of the Semantic Web, promising a digital landscape that is not only more intelligent but also remarkably accurate and context-aware. This powerful synergy addresses inherent limitations of each technology when used in isolation, creating a more robust and reliable foundation for AI-driven applications.
  
  
  Grounding LLMs with Knowledge Graphs
Large Language Models, while adept at generating coherent and grammatically correct text, often struggle with factual accuracy, a phenomenon commonly referred to as "hallucination." This limitation stems from their training on vast, unstructured datasets, which do not inherently provide a verifiable framework for facts. This is where Knowledge Graphs become indispensable. KGs offer a structured, verifiable repository of facts and relationships, acting as an external, authoritative memory for LLMs.By integrating KGs, LLMs can query and retrieve precise, domain-specific information, significantly reducing the propensity for generating incorrect or misleading outputs. As noted by DataCamp, "An LLM with access to contextual and domain-specific information can use that knowledge to formulate meaningful and correct responses. KGs allow LLMs to programmatically access relevant and factual information, thus better responding to user queries." This grounding mechanism transforms LLMs from mere text generators into knowledgeable assistants capable of providing fact-checked, reliable information.
  
  
  LLMs Enhancing Knowledge Graph Operations
The benefits of this synergy are bidirectional. While KGs ground LLMs, LLMs, in turn, can revolutionize the way Knowledge Graphs are created, enriched, and queried. Traditionally, building and maintaining KGs has been a labor-intensive process, requiring significant manual effort to extract entities and relationships from unstructured data. LLMs can automate and accelerate these tasks, acting as powerful engines for:Entity and Relationship Extraction: LLMs can process vast amounts of unstructured text – from scientific papers and news articles to customer reviews – and automatically identify entities (people, places, organizations, concepts) and the relationships between them. This capability streamlines the initial population of KGs.Knowledge Graph Enrichment: As new information emerges, LLMs can continually scan and integrate this data into existing KGs, keeping them up-to-date and comprehensive. This dynamic knowledge integration is crucial for applications requiring real-time information.Natural Language Querying: KGs are typically queried using specialized languages like SPARQL or Cypher, which require technical expertise. LLMs bridge this gap by translating natural language queries from users into the appropriate graph query language. They can also interpret the structured output from the KG and present it back to the user in a human-readable format. This makes KGs accessible to a much broader audience, democratizing access to structured knowledge. As DataCamp highlights, LLMs "convert plain-language user requests to query language and by generating human-readable text from the KG’s output. Thus, they allow non-technical users to interface with KGs."
  
  
  Real-World Applications of the Synergy
The combined power of KGs and LLMs is unlocking transformative applications across diverse industries:Advanced Semantic Search: Traditional keyword-based search often falls short in understanding user intent and context. By leveraging KGs, search engines can understand the relationships between entities and concepts, while LLMs can interpret complex natural language queries. This leads to more precise and contextually relevant search results, moving towards the vision of Web 3.0 where search engines evaluate the meaning and context of queries.Intelligent Chatbots and Virtual Assistants: The integration of KGs provides conversational AI with a structured knowledge base, allowing them to offer more accurate, consistent, and less error-prone responses. This enhances their ability to engage in complex, multi-turn conversations and provide up-to-date information, as seen in the evolution of virtual assistants.Enhanced Recommendation Systems: KGs can model intricate relationships between users, items, and their attributes (e.g., a user's past purchases, preferences, and the characteristics of products). LLMs can then analyze this rich, structured data to generate highly personalized and accurate recommendations, going beyond simple collaborative filtering.Drug Discovery and Healthcare: In the medical domain, KGs can integrate vast amounts of scientific literature, clinical trial data, patient records, and drug information, representing complex biological pathways and disease mechanisms. LLMs can then assist researchers in extracting new insights, identifying potential drug targets, and accelerating the drug discovery process by querying this integrated knowledge base.Fraud Detection and Risk Analysis: KGs are adept at representing complex networks of relationships, such as financial transactions, social connections, and supply chains. By analyzing these intricate patterns, KGs can help identify anomalies and suspicious activities that might indicate fraud or pose a risk. LLMs can then enhance this by interpreting unstructured data (e.g., transaction notes, communication logs) to feed into the KG or to explain detected anomalies in natural language.
  
  
  The Role of Semantic Web Standards
The foundation upon which Knowledge Graphs are built and, by extension, the entire synergy with LLMs, lies in core Semantic Web standards. Technologies like RDF (Resource Description Framework) and OWL (Web Ontology Language) are critical for creating the structured, machine-readable data that KGs rely on.RDF provides a standard model for data interchange on the Web. It represents information in triples (subject-predicate-object), forming a graph structure where each component is identified by a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). This linked data approach enables the seamless integration of information from disparate sources. OWL, built on top of RDF, provides a richer means to define ontologies – formal representations of knowledge in a specific domain. Ontologies specify classes, properties, and the relationships between them, allowing for more sophisticated reasoning and inference within a knowledge graph.Consider a simple RDF snippet illustrating how an article and its related concepts can be represented, forming a basic knowledge graph:This snippet demonstrates the fundamental principle of representing data as interconnected nodes and edges, a core concept in the Semantic Web and the backbone of Knowledge Graphs. For a deeper dive into these foundational concepts, you can explore resources on the Semantic Web.The synergy between Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models represents a monumental leap forward in artificial intelligence and the realization of a truly intelligent web. By combining the factual accuracy and structured nature of KGs with the linguistic understanding and generative capabilities of LLMs, we are moving towards a future where AI systems are not only more powerful but also more reliable, transparent, and capable of understanding and interacting with the world in a profoundly human-like way. This convergence is not just reshaping the web; it's defining the future of how we access, process, and interact with information on a global scale.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI &amp; Trading Bot Developer | Creator of Custom AI Avatars &amp; Market Tools | Real Results, No Bullshit</title><link>https://dev.to/artem2004/custom-ai-avatars-trading-bots-real-results-no-templates-personal-support-from-start-to-10lp</link><author>Artem Malkhanov</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 01:45:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[My name is Artyom.

It was marketed like a cheat code for infrastructure. One CLI to rule them all.But the reality? It’s dashboards on top of dashboards. Alerts that ping you into oblivion. CI/CD pipelines that break when Mercury’s in retrograde. And secrets that still end up in Slack messages.€50 free credits for 30 days trial Promo code: It’s not that DevOps is a lie it’s just… messier than advertised.You don’t see this in the glossy conference talks. But every DevOps engineer knows the truth: behind every “green build” is a trail of bash scripts, GitHub issues, and at least one broken promise.This article isn’t a rant. It’s a debug log a list of 10 silent frustrations every DevOps engineer deals with but rarely talks about. If you’ve ever stared at a failing pipeline and whispered “why,” this one’s for you.You push your code. Tests fail. You change nothing. Rerun the job. It passes.Welcome to the haunted house known as CI.There’s no greater productivity killer than a flaky pipeline. It’s like trying to deploy with a slot machine maybe you’ll get a green build today, maybe you’ll get  and a mystery timeout.The worst part? Everyone just accepts it.“Yeah, that test fails sometimes. Just rerun.”“Oh, GitHub Actions is weird with concurrency.”“Jenkins has , okay?”And so we rerun. Again. And again. Until the green checkmark blesses our PR like it’s some kind of ritual.This isn’t DevOps this is DevOps by hope and retries. CI tools should be a source of confidence, not confusion. But until we treat flaky tests and janky runners as real bugs (not just vibes), we’ll keep pretending reruns are a fix instead of an error in disguise.We all  we take secrets seriously. But let’s be honest half the time, we’re just hoping no one notices that  sitting in  in a Notion doc last updated 6 months ago.Secrets management is the one part of DevOps where every solution still feels duct-taped: is powerful, but configuring it without summoning a cursed token is another story. is sleek, until you hit usage limits. exists, but the UX feels like it was built as punishment.The real issue? Human behavior.Secrets live in weird places:Someone’s Downloads folder labeled Every team has “that one secret” that never got rotated and now holds production together like a forgotten Horcrux. Worse, secrets leak quietly until one day, you get an email from GitGuardian and suddenly you’re in incident response mode.Until secrets are  treated like code versioned, reviewed, rotated, and locked down we’re just playing hide-and-seek with our own infra.And spoiler: the internet  finds what you hide poorly.Your dashboard looks amazing. There’s a dark mode theme, graphs that spike like a DJ set, and a Prometheus panel with 47 metrics.And yet… no one knows what any of it actually means.Observability is supposed to help us understand our systems. But let’s be honest: half the time it’s just noise. You get alerts that say:pod_memory_usage_bytes threshold exceeded: Endless scroll with zero structure: Dozens of panels, all red, none actionable: Everyone says it’s amazing, no one has it set up rightThen there’s the  of observability tools. Somehow your monitoring bill is now higher than your compute bill. You have Datadog, New Relic, Prometheus, and Loki all running at once, but you still had to grep logs manually last week.The truth? Visibility doesn’t equal understanding.Observability only works when it’s:Tied to real incidents, not theoretical thresholdsOtherwise, it’s just expensive art and your 2am alert will be the same five-line Slack message that says nothing helpful.There’s a special kind of dread that comes from hearing your phone buzz at 2:43 AM. You don’t even look at it anymore you just  it’s not good.Being on-call was supposed to be rotational, balanced, and backed by automation. But most of the time, it feels like passive punishment.You wake up to a CPU spike that resolved itself before you even unlocked your phoneThe alert is real, but the runbook hasn’t been updated since Kubernetes v1.18Your backup never woke up… because no one updated the escalation policyPager fatigue is real not just because of the interruptions, but because so many alerts are . No context. No urgency. Just noise in the dark.And even when you’re not on-call, you carry the mental load. You second-guess deploys on Friday. You babysit feature flags. You fear “the quiet.”The solution isn’t to remove on-call it’s to :Use smarter alerting (SLOs, not metrics)Rotate for real, not just in theoryAnd for the love of uptime no alerts without actionable contextBecause no system is worth trading your sanity for.Terraform is supposed to make infra-as-code clean, declarative, and collaborative.But then two engineers run  in different branches, and suddenly you’re debugging a state file like it’s a corrupted save in Skyrim. that never release that no one notices until production looks different than staging shows changes no one asked for accidentally nukes your entire dev environmentYou’re told to “use workspaces” and “store state in remote backends,” but it still feels like handling radioactive material. One wrong move, and you’ve got an S3 bucket with public access and no logging… again.Then there’s the :Shared modules no one maintainsSecret variables sprinkled like seasoning across PRs that are just diffs of JSON noise and  togglesTerraform is powerful no doubt. But when it’s in the hands of a whole team, the complexity multiplies. Fast.Until we treat Terraform like software with testing, ownership, and proper CI it’ll keep biting the hands that code it.Welcome to microservices, where every service has:You deploy something. It breaks. You check the repo. The last commit was from an intern who left six months ago. The Slack channel is empty. The  links to a Confluence doc that 404s.Dev says, “Ask ops, they run it.”Ops says, “Ask dev, they built it.”QA says, “Wasn’t flagged in staging.”Security says, “We flagged it. No one fixed it.”No one  owns the service but everyone owns the consequences.Ownership in DevOps isn’t about assigning blame. It’s about:Setting clear escalation pathsKeeping docs current (yes, actually)Labeling infra clearly in dashboards and alert configsIn a world of ephemeral containers and disposable clusters, ownership isn’t automatic. It’s a decision. And when no one makes that decision, you get chaos in a nice CI badge wrapper.Shift left started with good intentions: Catch bugs early. Improve security. Shorten feedback loops.Then it slowly morphed into: “Hey devs, can you also own security, infra, monitoring, and cost optimization in this sprint?”Now, every PR is a battlefield:Infra team wants you to add TerraformSecurity drops a dozen linter warningsQA says you didn’t test across all 3 staging clustersYour manager wants it merged by EOD“Shift left” was supposed to be empowerment. It turned into delegation without support.Devs aren’t trained in ops. Ops aren’t trained in app logic. And yet the expectation is that everyone knows how to do everything, perfectly, with no mistakes and no extra time.Spoiler: shifting left without shifting  is just pushing blame left.Better DX (developer experience), not just more responsibilityActual collaboration, not email handoffsBecause DevOps isn’t about shifting burdens. It’s about building bridges ones that don’t collapse when someone adds a new pre-commit hook.The CI pipeline is green. The deployment succeeded. But nothing works. Welcome to the magical world of  the undocumented scripts, custom wrappers, YAML black magic, and tiny bash one-liners holding your whole system together.Nobody owns this glue. Nobody wrote tests for it. But everyone is afraid to delete it.There’s a  folder that hasn’t been touched since 2021CI includes ./deploy.sh && ./fix.sh && ./nudge.shYour job depends on a cron job you didn’t know existed until it failedSomeone wrote a Python CLI tool with no readme but 20 dependenciesThese things break silently. They don’t trigger alerts. They don’t log errors. They just quietly fail, leaving you wondering why the config map wasn’t updated or why traffic is routing to the wrong service.Infra glue is where DevOps tech debt goes to hide.Add ownership and version controlDocument even the small stuff (especially the small stuff)Refactor glue into pipelines and repeatable modulesIf it’s important, make it visible. If it’s not, kill it.Because nothing is scarier than a  file that no one remembers writing… but everyone’s afraid to remove.You open your task board. It’s packed with infra cleanup tickets, automation upgrades, and “migrate to Terraform 1.6” cards from three quarters ago.Then your phone buzzes DNS is broken again. You drop everything. Another fire. Another urgent deploy. Another config rollback that wasn’t versioned properly.You patch what’s breakingYou promise to revisit that long-term fix “next sprint”But the sprint ends. Then the next one. And that tech debt backlog? It’s basically a DevOps museum now.No time to improve infrastructureBecause you’re always reacting to infrastructureWhich never improves… because no one has timeIt’s not that teams don’t care. It’s that they’re stuck in  drowning in red alerts, half-migrated configs, and endless status check-ins.Block dedicated “non-fire” time each sprintTie infra tickets to actual OKRs (not just “good to have”)Assign real owners to lingering tasks or kill themCelebrate the boring wins: the cleanup no one sees, but everyone benefits fromBecause DevOps isn’t just about keeping things running it’s about creating space to make them better.We love DevOps the automation, the culture, the tooling. But let’s not pretend it’s all perfect.Behind every green CI badge is a bash script no one wants to touch. Behind every alert is someone who hasn’t slept through the night in weeks. And behind every “devs should own it” post is a team already stretched thin.This isn’t a rage-quit moment. It’s a reality check. These 10 frustrations don’t mean DevOps is failing they mean we still have work to do:Stop pretending reruns are good enoughAnd treat observability and on-call like human issues, not just tech onesYou’re not alone in this. If you’ve felt burnt out, buried in tickets, or betrayed by a pipeline at 1am welcome. You’re in good company.DevOps isn’t about having no problems. It’s about building systems that survive them.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Revolutionize your CLI: add AI to kubectl for smarter Kubernetes management</title><link>https://dev.to/devlinktips/revolutionize-your-cli-add-ai-to-kubectl-for-smarter-kubernetes-management-5bim</link><author>Devlink Tips</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 22:55:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you’ve ever stared at a  error at 2:17 AM while sipping cold coffee, you know the pain.  is the Swiss Army knife of Kubernetes, but let’s be honest it’s more like a vintage blade than a smart multitool. It gives you the data, but not the .The Kubernetes command-line tool is fast, flexible, and deeply ingrained in dev workflows. But it’s also stubbornly literal. You ask it for pod logs, it delivers logs pages of them without context, without insight. Want to understand why your deployment is failing? Better hope you enjoy spelunking through YAML and Stack Overflow.€50 free credits for 30 days trial Promo code: Now imagine this: You type kubectl ai explain pod error, and instead of a wall of logs, you get a clear, human-like explanation. Maybe even a fix suggestion. Maybe even the actual YAML to redeploy it cleanly. That’s the promise of LLM-powered command-line intelligence.This isn’t sci-fi. Developers are already wiring up GPT-4, Claude, and local models into their Kubernetes workflows. The CLI is evolving and this time, it’s learning to talk back.In this article, we’ll explore the rise of AI-augmented kubectl tools, how to build your own, and what to watch out for when your terminal gets a brain of its own.Let’s be real most of us don’t wake up excited to debug Kubernetes. We just want our pods to work and our deployments to stop breaking. But Kubernetes doesn’t care. It gives you logs. It gives you  output. It gives you YAMLs that could be ancient scrolls.So, what if your CLI actually ?That’s where AI comes in.Adding AI to  isn’t just a novelty it’s about upgrading your workflow from reactive to proactive. You’re no longer grepping through logs like a caveman. Instead, you’re asking:“Why is this pod crashing?”“What’s missing from this service definition?”“Can you generate a deployment for this container?”And getting human-readable answers back. Fast.: Stop Googling  for the 80th time.: Describe what you want, get a full YAML back.: New teammates can ask the CLI  something is broken and get answers without pinging you at midnight.Instead of memorizing every  flag, you can delegate the grunt work to a language model that’s read every K8s doc ten times over.The CLI becomes less of a tool and more of a teammate.AI in the CLI isn’t just a cool hack it’s already shipping. A few standout projects are taking the idea seriously, and some are surprisingly polished.Here’s a quick tour of what’s out there:A lightweight plugin that connects your  CLI to OpenAI’s GPT API. You type in a question like:And it parses the logs +  output, then gives you a human-like explanation. Built by Google Cloud devs — solid, minimal, does what it says.Think of this as , but with opinions. It analyzes your cluster for issues (e.g., failing pods, misconfigured services) and returns clear explanations like a Kubernetes-savvy buddy who’s seen it all before.Bonus: You can run it locally or hook it up to OpenAI or Azure’s LLMs.Experimental, but promising. Wraps LLM prompts around your cluster queries and commands. The idea: type natural language and it converts it into  commands + responses. Ideal for YAML generation, context help, and simplified command creation.Still early, but it’s targeting enterprise needs including multi-cluster management with smart AI overlay. Less plug-and-play, more customizable platform.→ Often discussed on r/kubernetes and in early-stage GitHub repos.The ecosystem is moving fast. Most of these tools are open source, so you can fork, tweak, and even build your own custom wrapper. And yes people are doing that, too.At a glance, it feels like magic: ask your CLI a vague question, and it spits out a perfect explanation or deployment YAML. But under the hood, it’s a series of very smart hacks wrapped around .Most tools hook into  as a plugin or wrap around it. Some use Go-based plugins (), others use shell wrappers or CLIs in Python/Node. Either way, the first move is hijacking your input before it ever hits the cluster.Behind the scenes, this triggers a real kubectl describe pod <name> and , then scrapes the output.If you’ve ever piped  into an LLM, you know it’s noisy. So the tools typically:Pull in relevant metadata (labels, status, container info)Structure logs in prompt-friendly formatThink: prompt engineering, but for command-line chaos.Here’s where it gets spicy:Some tools call OpenAI (GPT-4 or 3.5), Claude, or Azure’s models.Others use local LLMs like Ollama, LM Studio, or a self-hosted llama.cpp instance.You choose: cost vs control. Cloud APIs are accurate and quick to set up. Local models are slower but free and secure.AI + infra access = potential danger.Obfuscate secrets in logs (e.g., base64 values from Secrets)Limit scope (avoid full cluster dumps unless asked)Run in dry-run or read-only mode by defaultThe best setups let you define custom sanitization logic, so your GPT doesn’t accidentally learn your staging credentials.In short, these tools don’t reinvent  they just bolt on an LLM brain. And depending on your setup, that brain might be local, hosted, or fine-tuned to your cluster's quirks.You don’t need to be a Kubernetes core maintainer to add AI to your CLI. In fact, with just a few shell commands and an API key, you can bolt GPT onto  like a brain implant.Let’s scaffold a basic plugin that:Takes a natural-language questionRuns a real  commandFeeds the output to GPT-4Returns a helpful responseWe’ll use Bash for simplicity. Create a file called  (yes, just like a plugin)."Explain why my deployment isn't progressing""Suggest a fix for this failing container""Generate a YAML for an nginx Deployment with 3 replicas""Write a service that exposes port 443"Pair with tools like  or  if you want to clean or convert responses back into structured files.Add a  flag that just prints the GPT response without applying anything.Wrap it into a Go CLI with  for cross-platform support.Hook into kubectl plugin architecture for native integration ( friendly).And just like that, you’ve turned  into your new AI-powered sidekick.Once you’ve got basic AI responses working in your CLI, it’s hard not to think bigger. Here are some of the more advanced ways developers (and chaotic good SREs) are turning AI-powered kubectl tools into real DevOps accelerators.“It’s waiting for a missing ConfigMap. You can fix it with:kubectl create configmap my-config --from-literal=foo=barNow imagine it goes one step further:And boom it applies the fix.This is the dream but with a healthy dose of . Tools like  are already exploring this. The safest implementations always preview the patch before running .Your cluster might have multiple namespaces, custom kubeconfigs, or even multiple clusters.Good AI plugins read the current context:Then tailor responses to  environment. This avoids vague suggestions and helps generate YAMLs with the right , , or even .Tired of copy-pasting from old deployments?And boom you’ve got a clean manifest. Bonus: plug it directly into .Advanced users are building prompt templates to enforce internal standards (naming conventions, label schemas, RBAC policies). You’re not just generating YAML you’re generating .Large Language Models are smart, but they still hallucinate. Some tools are now adding:: Only apply if GPT is >90% sure: Always preview what would be applied: Record every prompt + responseIn short: treat AI like a junior teammate with genius ideas… who still needs a code review.Let’s be clear AI in your CLI is super cool… until it confidently suggests you delete the entire namespace.While LLMs are great at pattern matching and language generation, they  understand consequences the way you do. That’s why trust must be earned and verified especially when your production cluster is involved.kubectl repair statefulset to fix broken PVC mounts.”Helpful-sounding? Sure. Real? Not even close.LLMs will occasionally invent kubectl commands or APIs that don’t exist. They’re not trying to lie they’re just guessing based on patterns. This is why dry-run, manual confirmation, and guardrails matter.…then sending that to GPT? You just piped your base64-encoded tokens to an external service.Even if you’re using HTTPS, this data leaves your machine. That’s a risk — especially in regulated environments.Obfuscate or strip secrets before sending to AILimit API scopes or token accessConsider local LLMs if privacy is criticalCloud-hosted LLMs (like GPT‑4 or Claude) are powerful, but:Local LLMs (like LLaMA via Ollama or LM Studio) are:Slower (unless GPU-accelerated)A smart CLI lets you toggle between the two, depending on context. Local for infra auditing, cloud for complex diagnostics.If your AI-powered plugin applies a fix to production, you need a paper trail:Logging this ideally to your existing observability stack isn’t optional. It’s table stakes.TL;DR: AI is a powerful teammate, but not a senior engineer. Treat it like an overconfident intern who  ship a segfault to prod if you’re not watching.If we’re already feeding logs into GPT to debug pods, what’s the next frontier?The AI + DevOps intersection is just warming up and Kubernetes is only one part of the bigger puzzle. Here’s where things are headed:Right now, most AI plugins work reactively: you ask a question, it answers.Your AI agent investigates the affected podIt summarizes the problemThen opens a PR with the fixThat’s not sci-fi. Early integrations are happening: already supports scanning Prometheus metricsSome teams are using LLMs to summarize Grafana dashboards or suggest scaling policiesSoon, your monitoring tools won’t just  you they’ll  the issue and suggest a fix.Why should every team write their own nginx-deployment-generator?We might see a , where users can:Share reusable prompt templatesPublish cluster-specific assistantsCreate “AI roles” for networking, security, storage, etc.Think VSCode extensions but for your CLI.Edge workloads are constrained, remote, and often flaky. That’s where local LLMs shine.Micro-agents running on edge nodes that explain failures locallyOffline diagnosis using embedded modelsOn-device RBAC-aware YAML generationBonus: zero-trust architectures could benefit from AI that  policy enforcement and never leaks credentials.LLMs themselves are becoming infra.

Get ready to write YAML for your .It’s not about replacing engineers. It’s about freeing them from the soul-crushing grind of deciphering pod logs, so they can actually build things.Kubernetes isn’t going anywhere but how we interact with it is changing fast.

With  from , this isn’t just a bunch of bar charts. It’s a raw snapshot of what it actually feels like to be a developer in 2024: the wins, the warnings, the WTFs.This year’s data reads like a Slack rant from an overcaffeinated dev team:Rust is still winning “Most Loved” like it’s rigged.AI tools like Copilot and ChatGPT are everywhere but not everyone’s sold.Burnout is no longer subtle. It’s loud. Especially for mid-career devs.WordPress lives. Angular survives. And yes, everyone still uses Python.But beyond the numbers, the story is personal. You can see the tension: between learning and exhaustion, productivity and paranoia, hype and reality.€50 free credits for 30 days trial Promo code: So if you’re wondering what tech stacks are getting real love, which roles are rising, how devs are  using AI, and why more people are feeling tired than inspired this is your inside look.Let’s plug into what dev life really looked like in 2024 and why your voice still matters going into 2025.If 2023 was the year of AI hype, 2024 is when reality hit harder than a missing semicolon.The Stack Overflow survey didn’t deliver just one big “aha!” moment it delivered three overlapping plotlines that defined the developer experience this year:For the , Rust ranked as the most loved language. At this point, it feels less like a trend and more like a personality trait. Devs keep choosing it not because they’re forced to, but because they .Why? Memory safety without garbage collection. Great tooling. Strong community. Also, it makes you feel like a wizard when something compiles.Meanwhile, Python and JavaScript remain the actual workhorses. Not as sexy. Still everywhere.AI tools saw massive adoption: of devs now use AI assistants GitHub Copilot leads the pack, with ChatGPT close behindBut only  of developers say AI tools make them more productiveTranslation? Devs are using AI but they don’t fully  it yet.AI-generated code still needs debugging. The hallucinations aren’t funny anymore. And the fear of relying too much is real.A big red flag this year:  reported lower satisfaction than juniors.Mid-career burnout seems to be peaking. People love building but they’re tired of sprint cycles, meetings, and side hustles that feel like second jobs. Even with remote work, the boundaries are blurry.And yet? Most devs still code outside of work.This year’s data isn’t just about what tools we use it’s about  while using them. In 2024, the dev world didn’t just evolve. It  and some of us are still trying to recover.Developers are loyal. But only to the tools that don’t make them want to scream into the void at 3am.Each year, Stack Overflow asks devs what technologies they , , or  they could use more and 2024’s answers are a mix of predictable champions, stubborn villains, and a few surprises you might have rage-uninstalled last week. once again claims the crown. It’s the Beyoncé of programming languages everyone loves it, even if they’ve never used it in production. remains a favorite in DevOps land. It just works (mostly), and developers trust it like an old command line friend. takes top spot among databases.

Developers know what’s good, what’s bad, and what they wish they could use more. But company stacks, project realities, and legacy anchors often force compromise.That’s why “dreaded but still dominant” is the saddest genre of developer tooling.AI is everywhere in dev land right now. In your IDE. In your terminal. In your Jira tickets (sadly). It’s writing code, generating tests, suggesting regex, and occasionally… hallucinating nonsense with the confidence of a senior engineer who didn’t read the docs.According to the 2024 survey: of professional developers use AI tools  is the most-used assistant ranks second for day-to-day coding helpBut only  of devs say these tools actually make them more productiveThat’s not a landslide endorsement — it’s a cautious “meh.”AI tools are fast. But speed doesn’t always mean better.Code suggestions that  good but don’t compileOver-reliance that erodes problem-solving skillsHallucinations that are hard to spot in large diffs“Fixing the AI’s code” becoming its own full-time jobOne senior backend dev from Germany summed it up perfectly:“I use ChatGPT and Copilot every day, but I still double-check everything. They help but don’t replace my logic.”There’s a growing gap between  and .Devs like having AI tools available but don’t  in them yetMany are using AI to unblock ideas, write boilerplate, or explain unfamiliar syntaxBut when it comes to shipping real features? Manual review still rulesIn other words, AI is a sidekick, not the hero.AI tools are no longer optional. They’re part of the stack. But that doesn’t mean they’re magic. For now, developers are treating them like interns: useful, fast, and in need of supervision.You’ve heard it: “If you love what you do, you’ll never work a day in your life.” Cool idea. Until you’re juggling sprint tickets by day and debugging your side hustle at 2am wondering when “fun” turned into “fatigue.”The 2024 survey put numbers behind that creeping feeling most developers have had for years: burnout isn’t rare it’s routine.For the first time,  reported  than juniors.Juniors are still wide-eyed, shipping their first builds, getting excited about cool libraries. Seniors? They’re the ones holding the production system together with zip ties and Terraform.They aren’t just coding. They’re:Planning migrations no one will approveWriting documentation no one will readIt’s no wonder the joy dips as experience rises.Developers love to build. But the survey shows that many:Code outside work because they feel like they Worry they’re falling behind if they don’t have a GitHub side repoUse evenings and weekends to “stay relevant”That’s not a hobby. That’s unpaid overtime.The line between passion and pressure is thin and a lot of devs are quietly burned out from crossing it too many times.Sure, most devs now work remotely or hybrid. That helps. But Slack doesn’t care if you’re in bed. PagerDuty still rings at 3am. And async culture often means “always online.”Remote doesn’t automatically mean balanced.As one ML engineer from Canada put it:“Burnout sneaks up when you’re doing side projects and sprints at work. There’s no off switch.”Burnout isn’t a badge of honor. And in 2024, it’s not subtle it’s systemic. The real question isn’t “do you love code?” It’s: “Can you keep loving it without burning out?”Forget job titles on LinkedIn this section reveals where the real money flows, who’s working from where, and which roles are rising fast (while some quietly fade into the background).The 2024 survey shows a dev world that’s , , and increasingly shaped by ML, DevOps, and niche high-ROI skills. still top the salary charts (no surprises there).Developers who code in , , and  earn the most per skill small communities, high impact.Languages like , , and  are still dominant but don’t always pay the best.If you’re coding in Rust and living in Zurich, congratulations you’re probably doing fine. continue to be the most common job title by a long shot. saw a big jump likely due to growing infrastructure complexity and platform demands.Machine Learning engineers also climbed, with AI hype now generating real job titles. and  are trending down slightly, possibly due to shifting market demand and tool evolution.The generalist is still king but the  and  devs are quickly catching up.Over  of developers now work either remote or hybrid.Full-on return-to-office? Not happening.Most devs say remote work improves flexibility but they still crave better async communication and clearer boundaries.The pandemic changed how developers work and it’s sticking.Now it’s less about  you work and more about how well your stack handles Slack noise, meetings, and mental fatigue.Bottom line: The modern developer isn’t just shipping code they’re juggling tools, time zones, Terraform scripts, and burnout. And whether you’re full-stack or deep in the ML trenches, your role in 2024 looks more , more , and more  than ever.If you still think you need a computer science degree to become a developer, the 2024 survey just hit you with a .This year’s data makes it clear: developers don’t wait for permission to learn — they find the docs, hit YouTube, and figure it out in public.Only  of respondents had a Bootcamp grads and  now outnumber degree holdersThe fastest learners? Usually the ones who had to Google their way through their first error logNobody’s asking “Where did you study?” anymore. They’re asking, “Can you ship this, and do you write good commits?” of developers prefer  like YouTube, Stack Overflow, and free documentationInteractive courses, Discord groups, open-source contributions, and Twitch coding streams are risingOffline study? Not so much.Even universities are playing catch-up with what’s already happening on Dev.to, GitHub, and Reddit.Learning in 2024 isn’t about memorizing Big O notation it’s about:Setting up a Docker container without rage-quittingFiguring out the difference between Prisma and Sequelize at 1amKnowing when to say “nah, we don’t need a blockchain for that”The best developers don’t just know things. They know how to .So if you’re wondering whether you’re “qualified” to be a dev in 2024… You are if you’re willing to learn in public, Google with speed, and accept that the docs are your true professors.The dev world is global, curious, and let’s be real still not nearly as diverse as it should be.Stack Overflow’s 2024 survey gives us a clearer picture of  is writing the code that runs the world. And while some regions are rising, and more people are breaking in without degrees, the gaps in gender, access, and background are still very real., , and  continue to climb in survey responses proof that global dev culture is thriving far beyond Silicon Valley.The U.S. still leads in volume, but the margin is shrinking as more devs from South Asia, South America, and Europe add their voice.Tools, languages, and even memes now have a global accent.Only  of all respondents identified as Non-binary and gender-diverse devs made up less than In 2024, this number feels especially disappointing not because women aren’t coding (they are), but because many still don’t feel seen, welcomed, or counted.It’s not just about who writes the code. It’s about who feels  in the room, in the repo, in the community thread.The average developer has  of experienceBut over  have been coding for This is a community with depth and fresh energy. You’ve got seniors managing legacy C++ apps from the 2000s sitting right next to juniors pushing Rust to production for the first time.The gap between “veteran” and “beginner” is wide but that’s what makes the dev world so dynamic.Demographics aren’t just statistics. They shape how docs are written, which tools succeed, and what kind of dev culture we build next.We’ve made progress. But we’ve got a lot more lines of code (and culture) to refactor.Survey data is great. But sometimes, a single sentence from a burned-out backend dev or a salty frontend engineer captures the  better than 20 graphs ever could.These are the raw, real, painfully accurate developer quotes from the 2024 Stack Overflow survey that made us laugh, nod, and wince a little.I use ChatGPT and Copilot every day, but I still double-check everything. They help but don’t replace my logic.” Senior Backend Dev, GermanyThis one hits the AI productivity nail on the head. They’re tools, not wizards. We still carry the cognitive load.Why are we still using WordPress in 2024? That’s the real survey question.You can almost hear the PHP trauma. Legacy tech may be hated but it’s still running 43% of the web. Oof.Burnout sneaks up when you’re doing side projects and sprints at work. There’s no off switch.This is the quiet truth no productivity tool wants to market: context-switching and coding for fun don’t mix well when you’re tired.These aren’t just quotes. They’re every dev group chat condensed into bullet points.And they prove what this whole survey is really about: not just tools and tech but the people behind the screen, trying to make sense of a fast-changing industry while still getting things to compile.If one thing’s clear from the 2024 survey, it’s this: AI isn’t a maybe anymore it’s a given. It’s in your editor. It’s in your browser. It’s in the autocomplete suggestions for your commit messages.But here’s the thing: AI didn’t replace developers. It revealed what developers actually need.Yes, tools like Copilot and ChatGPT are changing workflows. But they’re not replacing dev intuition, debugging instincts, or plain old experience.AI is great at boilerplate.It’s fast at scaffolding.It’s decent at explaining foreign codebases.But when it comes to , , and “wait, does this even scale?” moments human devs still run the show.The future might be LLMs and Rust, but the present is… WordPress, Java, and janky shell scripts from 2012 that no one dares touch.And that’s not a failure it’s an opportunity.Modernizing, refactoring, and rethinking legacy systems will be one of the biggest challenges and career advantages for devs in 2025.Stack Overflow might not be the first tab open anymore but the knowledge behind it powers AI answers, model training, and team troubleshooting.Stack Overflow threads with AI might write the first draft, but real learning still comes from real questions asked by real humans.So as we head into 2025, here’s the takeaway:The future of development will have AI all over it. But it’ll still need developers who know when to say:“This looks right. But I’m gonna test it anyway.”You don’t have to be a senior architect shipping clean CI/CD pipelines to matter in the developer world.You could be a junior dev shipping your first app. A self-taught tinkerer learning Rust on weekends. A burned-out engineer silently rage-scrolling legacy PHP. And your experience shapes the ecosystem.The Stack Overflow Developer Survey doesn’t just sit on a dashboard somewhere.Framework maintainers read it.Tool creators use it to decide what to build next.DevRel teams, hiring managers, and tech educators track it to stay relevant.AI trainers literally mine it for model tuning.What you say in that form might change how the next version of VS Code works. Or whether that obscure bug in your favorite package gets prioritized. Or how much junior dev salaries move in your region.Screamed at an unexplained stack traceRolled your eyes at an unnecessary AI suggestionHad to “optimize” someone else’s Copilot commitAsked, “Am I the only one who’s exhausted?”…then you’ve got something to say.And now’s your chance to be heard.It takes 10 minutes. But the impact lasts all year.Let the next 65,000+ devs know .Want to dig deeper into the data, explore the conversations, or grab some inspiration for your next tech rant?

It was chaotic, personal, and honestly? Kinda beautiful. Somewhere in that messy frontier, one site stood taller than the rest .For a brief but explosive moment in the early 2000s, MySpace wasn’t just  social media platform it  the internet. It was where bands got discovered, friendships exploded over “Top 8” drama, and every user fancied themselves a self-taught web dev after editing their profile with some rogue  tags and CSS hacks.This wasn’t just a website. It was a movement. One where you controlled the look, the vibe, the sound, and sometimes even crashed your own profile page trying to embed a YouTube video.But then, just as fast as it took over… MySpace fell. Hard.It went from being the most visited site in the U.S. yes, ahead of Google to a digital ghost town your brain only revisits when nostalgia hits at 2 a.m. So what happened? Was it Facebook? Bad code? Corporate overlords? All of the above?€50 free credits for 30 days trial Promo code: Let’s rewind and autopsy the rise and fall of the world’s first true social media giant from a dev’s point of view. Spoiler: it involves spaghetti code, questionable design choices, and the haunting words every programmer dreads…“Don’t worry, we’ll fix it in production.”Let’s be real: MySpace wasn’t polished. It was . It was chaotic. And that’s exactly why it worked.Where Facebook eventually built a clean, minimal grid that looked like a corporate resume template, MySpace felt like your teenage bedroom exploded into HTML. You could customize everything your background, your fonts, your layout, and even force unsuspecting visitors to listen to your favorite band the moment they loaded your page.It wasn’t just social networking. It was self-expression by any means necessary. You didn’t just scroll. You . Every profile was a weird mix of glitter GIFs, badly cropped anime wallpapers, autoplaying deathcore tracks, and Comic Sans headers. And we loved it.Want to show off your personality? Easy. Just slap on a layout from a sketchy third-party site, add 17 widgets, crash a few browsers, and boom identity unlocked.And then there was the infamous .You could literally rank your friends. Publicly. In order. Think about the absolute social warfare that caused in school hallways.“Wait… why am I number 4 now? What did I do?”Imagine Instagram letting you pin a “favorite friends leaderboard” on your profile. Gen Z wouldn’t survive the drama.But for all its eccentricity, MySpace gave users control. You were the front-end engineer of your own social identity even if your CSS was more “crime scene” than “style sheet.”In a way, it was the first time people online felt like they  their digital space. And that feeling? You can’t A/B test that into existence. MySpace didn’t scale well, but it sure vibed hard.Before social media influencers were a thing, MySpace was influencing the entire internet. Launched in 2003 by a group of eUniverse employees (yep, not exactly a Silicon Valley origin story), MySpace took the Friendster concept and cranked it to 11 with fewer rules, more music, and zero concern for clean code.Within two years, it exploded. By 2005, MySpace had over , and that number was doubling at warp speed. It became the most visited website in the United States by 2006, surpassing even Google. Let that sink in: in the era before Facebook dominance, MySpace  the internet’s main character.Naturally, the big fish came knocking.In July 2005,  (yes, the Rupert Murdoch one) bought MySpace for . At the time, it was hailed as a smart digital pivot for the media empire. What could go wrong?But before the cracks formed, MySpace was a cultural monolith. It was the launchpad for bands like  and , who gained massive followings just by uploading tracks to their profiles. It birthed online celebrities before the word “influencer” infected marketing decks everywhere. It even introduced many of us to the idea of “viral content.”And here’s the thing that often gets forgotten:  Like, actually making money. They had display ads, branded pages, music partnerships early Web 2.0 monetization before people even called it that.In dev speak, MySpace was a startup that scaled way too fast and caught the attention of enterprise… before it finished writing unit tests.It was fast, fun, and on top of the world. But under the hood?Let’s just say the foundation was… not great.So here’s where things start to smell like tech debt.As MySpace grew, the platform evolved like a bad Git repo massive, messy, and missing documentation. Every new feature felt like it was duct-taped to the last one, with barely any concern for architecture. Need a new widget? Copy-paste someone else’s HTML and pray it doesn’t break your profile.The development team was reportedly pushing code directly to production, often with little or no testing. Version control? Not really. CI/CD pipelines? Lol. MySpace was  held together by duct tape and vibes.One developer famously referred to the codebase as “Frankenstein’s monster with a CSS addiction.” The tech stack was clunky and monolithic, making even basic updates a game of Jenga change one thing, and everything could collapse.Worse still, MySpace kept adding more and more features in a bid to outdo Facebook:The result? . Every feature bloated the frontend, and users could feel it. The site slowed down. Pages crashed. Profiles became impossible to load if they had too many blingee GIFs or autoplay songs.And let’s not forget the . Cross-site scripting (XSS) was rampant. People embedded malicious code into profiles. It was basically a cyberpunk version of LiveJournal with zero moderation.At this point, even the dev team had trouble fixing bugs because fixing one often created five new ones. And management? They wanted , not fewer bugs.While MySpace was drowning in profile glitter, broken layouts, and CSS rage-quits, a quiet college project was gaining momentum and it was .Facebook launched in 2004, originally just for Harvard students. No crazy layouts, no autoplay music, no top 8 lists. Just clean, white space and structured profiles. It was, frankly, boring. But  boring. And that was its biggest flex.Where MySpace gave users creative freedom (and a thousand ways to break the UI), Facebook gave users stability. It was faster. Simpler. Less drama. Less chaos. And most importantly for people over 25 .From a dev point of view, Facebook was a technical dream compared to MySpace’s spaghetti stack:Strong backend infrastructureReal identity policy (no more  usernames)And while MySpace was constantly trying to be everything for everyone TV, classifieds, events, music Facebook focused on doing one thing really well: connecting people.Then, Facebook opened to everyone in 2006. That was the beginning of the end.The moment your mom could sign up, and nothing crashed when she logged in, . Quietly at first. Then in waves. Suddenly, your band friends were dual-posting on Facebook. Then they stopped logging into MySpace altogether.It wasn’t flashy. But Facebook . And MySpace couldn’t.Even worse? MySpace’s leadership underestimated Facebook. While Zuck was busy shipping clean code, MySpace execs were throwing marketing dollars at “cool new features” without fixing the existing mess underneath.It was like comparing a lean startup pushing weekly updates… to a bloated enterprise team arguing over what font the logo should be.Alright, time to pop the hood and it’s not pretty.The fall of MySpace wasn’t just bad UX decisions or getting outplayed by Facebook’s strategy. At its core, it was a slow-motion software engineering disaster. The backend was a mess. The frontend was a crime scene. And the dev team? Burnt out, under-resourced, and caught in a feature factory run by execs who didn’t speak “code.”Let’s walk through the pain:The architecture was never built for scale. What started as a PHP-powered prototype grew into a massive tangle of copy-pasted scripts, inline styles, and unversioned hacks. By the time News Corp bought the company, the codebase was a frankenstein of duct-taped fixes, inconsistent conventions, and mystery functions no one dared delete.“No one knows what this line does, but if we remove it the login page breaks.”6.2. No proper version controlWhile Facebook was building robust internal tools and infrastructure, MySpace devs were still pushing changes manually. No Git. No reliable backups. It was cowboy coding at enterprise scale. You could deploy broken code on Friday and hope someone noticed before Monday.6.3. Poor developer toolingThere were , no test suites, no code reviews basically the exact opposite of modern CI/CD pipelines. Every deploy was a gamble, and bug tracking was like yelling into the void.6.4. Management vs EngineeringThis was the kicker: MySpace was run by marketers and media folks who treated it like a brand, not a tech product. Engineers weren’t given a seat at the table. Instead of refactoring code or improving performance, they were told to “ship another feature.” Fast.That’s how you end up with bloated media widgets on a site already gasping for memory.6.5. Facebook’s open-source culture vs MySpace’s closed siloBy the time MySpace considered a real dev reboot, Facebook had already open-sourced React, launched a robust Graph API, and built a data center empire. MySpace still didn’t know how many nested  tags were on the average profile.Bottom line: MySpace didn’t just lose the user race it . And in tech, that’s what kills you quietly while the numbers still look good.At first, MySpace was still hanging on thanks to the music scene.Even as regular users jumped ship for Facebook’s polished feed, MySpace remained a hub for bands, artists, and music lovers. It was the only platform where a band could:Upload their tracks directly to a playerCustomize their vibe-heavy pageBuild a following without a record labelFor a while, this niche kept the platform breathing. It became  place to discover indie acts, post tour dates, and share new releases. Remember  MySpace helped launch them. Same with , , and countless other MySpace-era success stories.But even the music crowd started to drift.Why? Same reason everyone else left: the platform didn’t evolve.Profile pages? Slow to load.Mobile experience? Barely functional.Fan engagement? Dropping fast.And then… came the great content wipe of 2019.During a poorly handled server migration, MySpace managed to permanently delete over 12 years of user content photos, videos, blog posts, songs, everything. Just gone. No backups. No apologies that mattered.“Due to a server migration project, any photos, videos, and audio files you uploaded more than three years ago may no longer be available.”Translation: our bad, we nuked your digital legacy.Artists who had stuck around suddenly lost entire discographies. Loyal users who kept visiting out of nostalgia found their personal archives erased. And the few who still believed? They stopped logging in altogether.At that point, MySpace wasn’t just irrelevant it was radioactive.The once-vibrant town square became a haunted ruins map in an online game no one played anymore.Let’s do a little dev fantasy: what if MySpace didn’t completely brick itself?There are a few alternate timelines where MySpace doesn’t die a tragic meme but it would’ve required actual technical foresight and, you know, .Timeline A: MySpace doubles down on musicInstead of chasing Facebook with feature bloat, imagine if MySpace had said:“Cool, Facebook is for normies. We’re for creators.”They could’ve evolved into a hybrid of Spotify + Bandcamp + SoundCloud, with social elements baked in. Own the niche. Focus on UX for artists and listeners. Let bands sell merch, post concert streams, drop exclusives.Basically: turn into . They had the head start. They had the audience. But they lost the plot.Timeline B: Open-source and community-drivenWhat if they’d embraced open source? Shared parts of their platform like the music player API or theming engine and invited devs to improve it?Imagine a plugin ecosystem like WordPress but for social media pages. A proper dev kit. An actual backend rebuild. A “MySpace Dev Mode.”They had an army of early coders hacking layouts anyway. Turn that into a movement.Timeline C: Tech reboot with real engineersStrip it all back. Rebuild with modern frameworks. Fix performance. Focus on one core use case (music, maybe), and scale from there.Facebook  better because of features it was better because . MySpace could’ve caught up. But instead of rewiring the engine, they just slapped glitter on the dashboard.None of this happened, of course.Instead, MySpace ended up as a warning label for startups:“Don’t let your codebase rot while chasing shiny features.”It’s now a ghost site technically still live at myspace.com but more like a museum that forgot to pay its electric bill.MySpace is more than just a cautionary tale for social media companies it’s a masterclass in what not to do when building and scaling a tech product. Under all the profile bling and CSS chaos lies a set of hard-earned truths every dev, startup founder, or product team should probably tattoo on their forearm.9.1. Cool features don’t matter if your site doesn’t loadYou can let users customize everything, build music players, and rank their friends but if your site , none of that matters. MySpace was feature-rich but experience-poor. It broke the golden rule: .9.2. Listen to your devs, not just your marketersWhile Facebook was architecting for scale, MySpace execs were like:“What if we added TV and dating features next?”Meanwhile, engineers were in a corner whispering, “We’re one deploy away from taking down the whole site.”Developers aren’t just ticket-resolvers. They see where the code is fragile and when a rewrite is smarter than duct tape. Ignore them at your peril.9.3. Technical debt is a time bombMySpace’s original codebase was never cleaned up. It just grew… and grew… until it collapsed under its own weight.Want to avoid a digital Chernobyl? Refactor early. Build in layers. Write tests. And please use version control like it’s oxygen.9.4. Don’t chase everything; own somethingMySpace tried to be Facebook, YouTube, Spotify, Craigslist, and more. It ended up being none of them.Pick one core thing your app does better than anyone else. Ship that. Improve that. . You can’t scale a product that doesn’t know what it is.9.5. UX isn’t just design it’s performance, clarity, and trustFacebook won because it felt clean, fast, and reliable. MySpace felt like an internet rave hosted on dial-up. You can be fun, weird, experimental but it has to work. Always.In short: don’t MySpace your codebase.The graveyard of dead apps is filled with products that focused on flashy features over solid foundations.MySpace didn’t just fall it . Not overnight, but gradually, like a corrupted save file. One feature at a time. One slow-loading profile at a time. One overlooked bug at a time.Today, MySpace technically still exists. You can visit myspace.com, scroll through some ghostly artist profiles, and wonder why everything feels like a forgotten Flash game from 2009. But the soul? Long gone.And yet .MySpace taught an entire generation of devs what HTML was. It gave kids the first taste of web development, even if that meant copy-pasting  bombs into neon-background profile themes. It helped launch real music careers. It gave us the drama of the “Top 8,” the chaos of unmoderated creativity, and the reminder that the internet used to be weird .But it also gave us a warning:You can’t scale chaos. You have to rebuild it. Or it breaks you.If you’re a dev building the next social thing, a founder shipping new features, or even just someone hacking on side projects . Respect your codebase. Respect your users. Don’t let bloat, bugs, or boardroom decisions sink something beautiful.Because behind every dead platform is a forgotten  that someone didn’t fix in time.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Hidden Power of Redis: Fast, Flexible, and Freakishly Simple</title><link>https://dev.to/devlinktips/the-hidden-power-of-redis-fast-flexible-and-freakishly-simple-5g38</link><author>Devlink Tips</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 22:41:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Redis gets called a cache. Which is kind of like calling a Ferrari “just a car.”Sure, Redis can cache things. But that’s like saying JavaScript can only make alert boxes. Redis is , stupidly flexible, and quietly powering some of the most real-time systems on the internet from leaderboards and chat apps to analytics, rate-limiting, queues, and even lightweight databases.It’s not just a store. It’s a toolbelt packed into RAM.But if you’re still thinking of Redis as just a place to “save stuff for 5 minutes with a TTL,” you’re missing out. The truth is:€50 free credits for 30 days trial Promo code: Redis has specialized data types you’ll actually useRedis can behave like Kafka, Memcached, and MongoDB… all at onceRedis can accidentally become your production database if you’re not carefulThis isn’t a marketing deep-dive. It’s a real-world breakdown of , when to use it (and when not to), and why devs keep reaching for it when performance matters.Redis is an in-memory key-value store that feels like a database, performs like a cache, and secretly wants to be your message broker.Here’s the elevator pitch for devs: You give Redis a key, it gives you back a value . But unlike basic key-value stores, Redis speaks fluent data structures. It’s not just  and it’s also: that auto-remove duplicates with built-in ranking that behave like Kafka-light, , and  that let you do freaky-fast analyticsRedis is single-threaded (by design), runs entirely in memory (unless you configure persistence), and responds to commands in microseconds.If traditional databases are filing cabinets, Redis is a RAM-powered vending machine: instant delivery, always hot, never frozen.And that’s why it’s everywhere from job queues to session stores to real-time leaderboards.Most people meet Redis through  and think, “Cool, it’s a fast key-value store.” But Redis is secretly a toolbox of data structures disguised as a cache.Here’s what’s actually inside that toolbox:The default. Used for key-value storage like . Simple, fast, and great for caching API responses or tokens.Bonus: You can use Redis strings as counters with Ordered sequences of strings. Think of them like linked lists. Use commands like , , , . task queues, comment streams, or activity feeds.Unordered collections of unique values. No duplicates allowed. storing tags, unique visitors, or checking membership:SISMEMBER activeUsers user42Sets, but with a score for each value. Perfect for  or ranking systems.ZADD leaderboard 1000 "PlayerOne"ZRANGE leaderboard 0 9 WITHSCORES → Top 10 players, instantly.Basically key-value pairs inside a key like a mini JSON object. Think:  user profiles, configs, metadata blobs.Redis’s answer to Kafka. Append-only log with consumer groups, IDs, and persistence. logging, real-time messaging, event sourcing.These are magic for counting things efficiently.: track booleans like “Has user logged in today?”: track  unique counts with tiny memory counting daily active users with only kilobytes of RAM.Store lat/long coordinates and run radius queries. “Show drivers within 2 km” or “Find the closest restaurant.”Redis isn’t just about speed. It’s about the right structure for the job with blazing speed as a bonus.If you’re still thinking Redis is just “a fast Memcached,” buckle up. Here’s what Redis can do in the wild:Yes, Redis is blazing fast for caching. Store rendered HTML, DB query results, API calls, and boom instant reads.Add an expiration and you’ve got ephemeral memory without the memory leak. Simple, elegant, classic.With Lists or Streams, Redis becomes a reliable queue. You can  jobs, and your workers can  them.Or better yet: Use  and  from Streams for persistent, consumer-grouped message queues. job runners, background workers, ETL pipelines.Store JWTs, user sessions, or auth tokens that expire. Low latency + TTL = perfect for temporary auth data.Redis has built-in publish/subscribe channels. Send messages across microservices instantly. real-time alerts, chats, dashboard updates.Sorted Sets () let you build live leaderboards in minutes. gaming, contests, top-10 rankings.Count API requests per user per minute. If they exceed the limit, block.Elegant, memory-safe, and ridiculously performant.replacing your database it’s protecting it. It’s the first responder before you call in the heavy artillery (like Postgres or Kafka).Redis feels instant. Because… well, it pretty much is.Here’s why Redis is consistently sub-millisecond fast: Everything lives in RAM. No disk reads, no spinning rust, no waiting. Yep, one core. But that’s a feature, not a bug. No locks, no race conditions just predictable speed. Fast language, tight memory control, zero fluff.Optimized data structures Everything from Sets to Streams is built to be efficient in both space and time. No SQL parsing, no schemas, no query planners just commands.Even Redis has limits. Watch out for: Storing 20MB JSON blobs? Please don’t. Redis is not your file system. Since it’s in RAM, Redis will evict or block when you hit limits. Not fun mid-deploy.Massive Lua scripts or slow commands Redis runs everything in one thread. Long-running tasks = everything else waits.Persistence mode pitfalls If you turn on AOF (Append Only File) or snapshots, disk I/O  become a bottleneck especially during big writes.That’s fast enough to be the backbone of real-time apps, queues, and counters.. When you run out of RAM, it’s not Redis anymore. It’s a nightmare.One of the most misunderstood things about Redis: Yes, it’s in-memory but it can still persist your data. You just have to decide  persistent you want it to be.Think of it like a . Redis takes a snapshot of your data every X seconds or after Y writes.You’ll lose anything between the last snapshot and the crashEvery single write command is logged to a file in order. On restart, Redis replays the log.Durable: almost nothing lostYou can set how often to flush (, , )Slower writes (I/O overhead)Yes you can  for fast snapshots plus write durability.multi-threaded AOF rewrite, so that slowdown is less painful now.Even with persistence, Redis isn’t ACID like a traditional database. It’s , not crash-proof.If you  zero data loss and high availability, use Redis with: (for failover) (for sharding + HA)Or hosted solutions like  or  Redis can survive a crash. But only if you set it up that way. Don’t treat it like a database unless you configure it like one.You’ve got the basics down. Now let’s talk how Redis is used in battle.Here are some architecture patterns you’ll actually see in the wild:App checks Redis first. If it’s not there → fetch from DB → store in Redis. Reduces DB load. Simple. Easy to manage TTLs. If your data changes . You risk serving stale info.Writes go through Redis  the database. Always fresh. Cache and DB stay in sync. More latency. Two writes instead of one.App only talks to Redis. If Redis doesn’t have it,  fetches from DB via a data loader function. Redis modules or Redis proxies like DynomiteMultiple services listen to the same Redis channel. One publishes a message others respond in real-time. publishes , ,  all subscribeThis works great for decoupled, event-driven architectures.Store temporary things like:Redis excels when you  want things to stick around forever.Some teams (usually in gaming or real-time apps) use Redis as their main DB. Usually paired with AOF persistence + backups.TL;DR: Redis can be your cache, your queue, your pub-sub, or your full-blown NoSQL store if you architect it right.Redis is fast, flexible, and fun. But it’s not always the right choice.Here’s when you should pause and reconsider:Redis is eventually consistent unless you set up persistence correctly. Even then, it doesn’t replace your , , or .If you’re storing billing data, Redis should notRedis stores everything in . That’s expensive. If your dataset is 100GB+ and mostly cold? Use disk-based DBs.Use Redis to , not store the whole thing.Redis doesn’t do SQL, joins, or referential integrity. If your app logic requires “give me all orders where customer is from Spain,” you’re better off using a relational DB.Redis is single-threaded. If you’re running big Lua scripts or blocking commands, it’ll bottleneck everything else.Rule of thumb: Redis should feel like a Formula 1 car. If you’re loading it like a dump truck, something’s off.In Redis, you’d have to manage that logic manually or duplicate data across keys.Using Redis for everything is like putting sriracha on cereal bold, unnecessary, and probably going to end badly.Redis is the Swiss Army knife of backend devs. It can cache, queue, publish, rank, store all at ludicrous speed.Easy to underestimate in terms of cost and memory usageUse Redis like a scalpel, not a hammer. It shines when you want , , and  not when you need complex joins, massive persistence, or rock-solid durability guarantees.If you treat Redis like a real-time helper instead of a full-blown DB, it’ll serve you well.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CI/CD Is Your Code’s Nervous System, Your App Doesn’t Ship Without It</title><link>https://dev.to/devlinktips/cicd-is-your-codes-nervous-system-your-app-doesnt-ship-without-it-4ppb</link><author>Devlink Tips</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 22:35:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CI/CD gets thrown around in meetings like it’s just another box on a checklist.“Oh yeah, we have CI/CD.” Sure. And I  a gym membership. Doesn’t mean I use it right.Let’s be real: most devs know the acronym, but don’t really know the . Or worse they think CI/CD is some DevOps magic YAML that auto-deploys things when you hit . But here’s the truth:€50 free credits for 30 days trial Promo code: CI/CD isn’t just about automation. It’s about confidence.When it’s done right, CI/CD is the  of your entire engineering workflow. It’s what tells your app:“Oh no, roll it back fast.”“Run the tests, run the builds, run the checks, now ship it.”When it’s done wrong? You’re one broken pipeline away from pushing untested code into production on a Friday afternoon with no rollback plan and a Slack full of red alerts.If you’re looking for a TL;DR to sound smart in a meeting, here it is: makes sure your code works. makes sure your code goes where it’s supposed to.That’s it. That’s the core idea.Continuous Integration (CI) Every time you push code, your team’s system automatically checks:Is this thing safe to merge? Once it passes all those checks, the system preps your code for deployment:Maybe even ships it to productionWith minimal (or zero) manual stepsYou’ll hear this thrown in too. = skip the “click to deploy” button and just auto-release every change that passes CI/CD.It’s great for small, frequent, low-risk releases. It’s terrifying if your test suite is flaky and you deploy on Fridays.Now that we’ve decoded the acronyms, let’s look at what  under the hood.You push a commit. Seems innocent enough. But behind the scenes, your CI pipeline spins up like a caffeinated squirrel on Kubernetes.Here’s what  happens (or should happen) the moment you  or open a pull request: The CI tool (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.) grabs the latest code from your branch or PR. This is the make-or-break moment:Type checks (if you’re living the TypeScript life) The faster these run, the faster you know if your code is garbage. This includes compiling, bundling, containerizing whatever your app needs to go from “code” to “runnable unit.” Think: , , Docker image, or Next.js static site.Static analysis / security scans (optional but smart) Tools like SonarQube, Snyk, or Trivy check for code smells, known vulnerabilities, and “oops” moments. If everything passes, the pipeline packages the output for delivery (usually in a container registry or artifact store).CI is your . If your tests break, the pipeline stops. If your build fails, nothing gets shipped. If your PR has 178 lint errors, the reviewer shouldn’t even see it.CI exists to catch bad code before it becomes everyone’s problem.Run unit tests on every pushRun heavier integration tests only on PRs or mergesDon’t block every commit on a full e2e pipeline unless you’re into painLet’s say your CI passed. All tests green. Artifacts built. Life is good.You want to get that code  — but without turning your production environment into a live experiment gone wrong.That’s where CD (Continuous Delivery or Deployment) kicks in. Your CD tool grabs the latest build artifact from your registry (e.g., Docker Hub, S3, GitHub Packages). This is your safe space.Runs post-build smoke testsMay include database migrations, API tests, or even simulated traffic3. Run staging tests / health checks The pipeline ensures that staging isn’t on fire. Tools like Cypress, Postman, or Helm test can run here.4. Optional: Manual approval gate Some teams stop here and wait for a human to click “Approve” before deploying to prod. Others just YOLO. This can be:: Swap traffic to new version: 5% of users get the new version first: Update pods in batches6. Rollback (if things break) If health checks fail or metrics spike, the pipeline auto-reverts to the previous version. Or at least, it should.Never trust a CD pipeline without rollback logic. Deployments should be boring. If they’re exciting, they’re broken.The goal of CD isn’t speed. It’s safe speedYou know good CI/CD when you feel it.It’s the difference between deploying with one click and… having to message three people, SSH into a production box, and pray nothing breaks while you stare at logs at midnight.You push code. Tests run. Build passes. You get a Slack ping: “Staging passed. Click here to deploy to prod.”You click. It deploys. You go back to what you were doing.If something breaks in staging, it never touches prod.If something breaks in prod, you hit rollback and it Logs are readable. Test failures are traceable. Metrics are monitored.It’s boring. It’s predictable. And that’s exactly how it should be.Tests take 25 minutes to run, and half the time they fail for no reason.You don’t know which pipeline ran, or if it even finished.You have to merge  manually into your branch just to get the pipeline to stop yelling at you.The last guy who set this up left six months ago. The scripts haven’t been touched since.Your deploy button is  and a production server IP in your terminal history.CI/CD is your interface to shipping. If it sucks, shipping sucks.Automate boring things. But make boring things visible. Don’t hide CI/CD in the shadows. Make it part of your team’s culture.Let’s be honest half the time people say “DevOps,” they mean “some YAML I don’t understand.” And GitOps? Even more misunderstood. But these aren’t buzzwords they’re philosophies. And CI/CD is the engine that makes them actually work.Let’s break this down like engineers, not marketers.DevOps isn’t just Jenkins and bash scripts.Automation replaces manual processesEveryone shares ownership of shippingTools make this easier, but the point is: build fast, deploy safely, and don’t throw stuff over the wall.With GitOps, your entire infrastructure is described in Git.If it’s not in Git, it doesn’t existChanges happen via pull requestsDeployments are triggered by Git changes, not humans clicking around in cloud dashboardsThink of it like version control for your Kubernetes cluster. Tools like  or  continuously sync Git state to your actual infrastructure.It’s not one or the other it’s all connected. you manage that shipping logic. DevOps is  you care about doing it right.If your team is using GitHub/GitLab + Kubernetes + ArgoCD/Tekton, congrats you’re already doing modern CI/CD with GitOps built in. Now make sure it doesn’t suck to use.You don’t need to build everything from scratch (please don’t). The CI/CD space in 2025 is full of tools that do the heavy lifting and some that try to do everything and confuse you in the process.Let’s break down the main players and when to reach for them. Open-source, GitHub-native teams Easy syntax, powerful integrations, free tier rocks Don’t over-engineer workflows. Keep jobs modular. Teams living in GitLab Built-in, powerful, YAML-based Complex setups can feel like a maze if you don’t modularize Legacy setups, self-hosted die-hards Infinite plugin power You’ll spend more time maintaining Jenkins than writing code unless you’re deeply invested Kubernetes + GitOps deployments Declarative, visual, syncs infra from Git Learning curve is real, but once it clicks, it’s magic Cloud-native CI/CD pipelines built on K8s Highly customizable, container-native Better with a platform (like Devtron) to abstract the complexity Teams using Kubernetes but want a GUI + control Combines ArgoCD + CI pipeline abstraction You don’t need to be a DevOps pro to deploy with confidence: Run your pipelines as code in containers: Repeatable, Docker-friendly builds: Still solid, but watch pricing and concurrency limitsPick tools that fit your team’s skill level and workflow. You can always get fancy later.deploy safely and frequently not collect YAML badges.You shouldn’t fear your CI/CD. You shouldn’t have to ask “is it safe to deploy?” every time you push a commit. You shouldn’t need to scroll through 800 lines of logs to find the one test that failed because someone forgot to mock a database call.Here’s how to keep your pipelines fast, friendly, and maintainable even when your app isn’t.Run unit tests  integration testsRun linting and formatting  you buildBreak the pipeline early and clearly so you don’t waste 12 minutes building broken codeUse conditional logic to only run jobs on relevant file changesDon’t rebuild Docker images if code hasn’t changedUse caching like your SSD depends on it (because it kinda does)Clearly mark success/fail linesGroup and collapse noisy outputYour logs should feel like a story. Not a machine breakdown from 1998.CD = deploy, deliver Mixing them creates spaghetti. Keep pipelines modular, version-controlled, and clearly documented.Before deploying to staging/prod, run a simulated deployCatch config issues and broken infra without actually shipping anythingThis is your last line of defense before production starts leaking smokeCI/CD should be , not tribal knowledge passed down like a cursed artifact.If your pipeline is 900 lines of YAML with no comments, you don’t have a CI/CD system. You have a cry-for-help.Too many teams treat CI/CD like some DevOps checkbox or a black box that “just runs when you push.”But here’s the truth:CI/CD is infrastructure for shipping software with confidence. It’s not just about going faster it’s about going faster without breaking everything.You can recover in minutes.You can test bold ideas without fear.You sleep better, debug less, and ship more.Everyone’s afraid to touch it.Your team gets slower, not faster.And nobody trusts the pipeline that was supposed to save them.You don’t need to become a CI/CD architect overnight. But you  need to understand your pipeline. What runs when? What breaks where? What can be automated, improved, or killed off?CI/CD is a shared responsibility. The better you treat it, the better it treats your code.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>RIP Prompt Engineering (once the hottest AI job): Why the Future Belongs to System Designers</title><link>https://dev.to/devlinktips/rip-prompt-engineering-once-the-hottest-ai-job-why-the-future-belongs-to-system-designers-4ea2</link><author>Devlink Tips</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 22:30:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For about six months, “prompt engineer” was the most buzzworthy title in tech. People were getting hired to write elaborate ChatGPT instructions like they were coding in ancient spells. Twitter threads, course funnels, and LinkedIn grifters all screamed the same thing: “Learn prompting or get left behind.”The tools are smarter. The interfaces are catching up. And the idea of spending your career crafting “perfect prompts” feels about as useful as knowing how to tune a fax machine.Prompt engineering isn’t dead. But it is being absorbed. Just like webmasters in the 2000s, it’s becoming a baseline skill not a job title.We’re not saying it was all hype. Prompting was essential… when the models were unpredictable and dumb. But the moment AI got better at understanding , the need to “speak its language” started to fade.And that’s actually good news. Because the next wave isn’t about hacking prompts. that know what you mean even when you don’t say it perfectly.Let’s rewind to early 2023. LLMs were exploding.

VCs were tweeting about it. Tech bros put “Prompt Wizard” in their bios.And to be fair, some of them were doing real work refining prompts for internal tools, embedding context into models, A/B testing outputs.But most of it was temporary glue. The models were clumsy, and someone had to babysit them. So we built prompts like duct-tape: weird, verbose, fragile.And then quietly the tools got better.Once the title “prompt engineer” started trending, the internet did what it always does:it turned a useful idea into a hype funnel.Suddenly, everywhere you looked:$497 “Ultimate Prompt Templates” eBooksPrompt bootcamps promising $300k/year jobsLinkedIn flexers bragging about their prompt “frameworks” like they’d reinvented YAMLThe people who looked like prompt geniuses were usually just:Early users who spent enough time testing edge casesPeople who read the docs (which, let’s be real, no one else did)Folks who figured out that certain phrasing patterns worked better than others… until the next model update broke everythingThey weren’t magicians.

As AI applications become more pervasive, the demand for efficient, secure, and portable inference at the edge—closer to data sources—has never been greater. Wasm, a low-level bytecode format, is emerging as a powerful solution to meet this demand, enabling high-performance AI inference directly on resource-constrained edge devices and even within web browsers.WebAssembly's inherent characteristics make it an ideal candidate for AI inference on edge devices: Wasm binaries execute at near-native speeds, often outperforming traditional interpreted languages like Python. This is crucial for real-time AI applications where low latency is paramount. As highlighted in a WASM I/O session, Wasm applications can be under 20MB and run at native speed, integrating well with Kubernetes and being portable across various hardware. Wasm's "write once, run anywhere" capability is a game-changer for edge AI. A single Wasm module can run across diverse hardware architectures (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs) and operating systems without modification. This eliminates the need for platform-specific builds and simplifies deployment across a heterogeneous fleet of edge devices. This cross-platform compatibility is a significant advantage over Python-based solutions that often require complex dependency management and are tied to specific hardware. Wasm operates within a sandboxed environment, providing strong isolation and preventing malicious code from accessing unauthorized system resources. This secure execution model is vital for edge devices that might be deployed in untrusted or vulnerable environments. Wasm modules are typically very small, leading to reduced memory consumption and faster cold start times. This is particularly beneficial for edge devices with limited memory and storage. Compared to large container images for AI frameworks (e.g., a 3GB PyTorch container), a Wasm runtime and app can be under 20MB, offering significant efficiency gains.The practical applications of Wasm-powered AI at the edge are diverse and expanding: Wasm can enable predictive maintenance by running anomaly detection models directly on factory floor sensors, identifying equipment failures before they occur. It can also power real-time quality control systems by analyzing images or sensor data from production lines. AI models deployed via Wasm on street cameras can perform real-time traffic analysis, pedestrian counting, and security monitoring, optimizing urban planning and emergency response without sending sensitive data to centralized servers. From smart home gadgets to wearables, Wasm allows AI features like voice assistants, gesture recognition, and personalized recommendations to run on-device, enhancing privacy and responsiveness. Drones, robots, and self-driving vehicles can leverage Wasm for real-time decision-making, object recognition, and navigation, ensuring immediate responses crucial for safety and performance. The ability to run LLMs on edge devices with WasmEdge, as demonstrated by Michael Yuan, opens doors for more sophisticated on-device intelligence in such systems.
  
  
  Hands-On Tutorial: Deploying AI to the Edge with Wasm
This tutorial will guide you through deploying a pre-trained AI model to an edge device using WebAssembly, specifically leveraging the WasmEdge runtime and WASI-NN. A Raspberry Pi 4 (or similar single-board computer) with a Linux-based OS (e.g., Raspberry Pi OS).  Rust toolchain (for developing the Wasm module) (for Wasm compilation)  Node.js (for the orchestrating application, optional)  A pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model (e.g., MobileNetV2 for image classification).
  
  
  Step 1: Choose and Prepare Your AI Model
For this tutorial, we'll use a pre-trained image classification model, such as MobileNetV2, in TensorFlow Lite () format. Many pre-trained models are available from TensorFlow Hub or can be converted from other frameworks (like Keras or PyTorch) to TFLite using TensorFlow's converter tools. Ensure your model is quantized for optimal performance on edge devices if possible. Place your  model file in a  directory within your Rust project.
  
  
  Step 2: Develop the Wasm Module (Rust)
We'll write a Rust program that loads the TFLite model and performs inference using the  crate, which provides bindings to the WASI-NN specification.First, create a new Rust library project:cargo new  wasm_ai_inference
wasm_ai_inference
Add the  dependency to your :Now, replace the content of  with the following conceptual code. This code demonstrates how to load a TensorFlow Lite model and perform a basic inference.This conceptual code demonstrates the core interaction with WASI-NN. The  macro embeds your  model directly into the Wasm binary, making it a self-contained unit.Compile your Rust code into a Wasm binary targeting the  target.rustup target add wasm32-wasi
cargo build  wasm32-wasi This will produce a  file in target/wasm32-wasi/release/wasm_ai_inference.wasm.
  
  
  Step 4: Set up the Edge Device
On your Raspberry Pi (or other edge device), install the WasmEdge runtime. WasmEdge is a high-performance, lightweight Wasm runtime optimized for edge computing and AI inference.
curl  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | bash This command installs WasmEdge and its extensions, including WASI-NN.Transfer your compiled  file to your edge device (e.g., using ). Also, ensure your  model is accessible on the device, ideally in the same relative path as when compiled (or you can specify an absolute path in your Rust code).Now, run the Wasm module using WasmEdge:
wasmedge  .:. wasm_ai_inference.wasm
The  flag grants the Wasm module access to the current directory, which is necessary for WASI-NN to potentially load external model files or access input data if not embedded. The output will show the inference result, for example: Inference complete. Top prediction: Class X with score Y.
  
  
  Step 6: Integrate with an Application (Optional)
To make your Wasm-powered AI truly useful, you'll often want to integrate it into a larger application. You can call your Wasm module from a Node.js or Python application using WasmEdge's language bindings.Node.js Example (Conceptual):First, install the WasmEdge Node.js SDK:Then, you can write a JavaScript file (e.g., ):This conceptual example shows how you would instantiate a WasmEdge VM and load your Wasm module. For full functionality, you would need to implement the WASI-NN host functions or use a higher-level SDK that abstracts these interactions, allowing your Node.js application to pass real-time data (e.g., from a camera feed) to the Wasm module and receive inference results.
  
  
  Challenges and Future Outlook
While Wasm for edge AI offers significant advantages, there are still challenges to address. Tooling maturity, though rapidly improving, can sometimes be a hurdle for developers. Debugging Wasm modules, especially those integrated with AI frameworks, can also present complexities. Furthermore, the size of AI models and their loading times, particularly in browser environments, remain important considerations for optimizing user experience. Finally, seamless integration with the vast ecosystem of existing AI frameworks is an ongoing effort.The future of WebAssembly and AI is exceptionally promising. We can anticipate further standardization of WASI-NN, making it even easier for developers to build portable AI applications. Increased adoption in commercial AI products is highly likely, as companies recognize the advantages of edge and in-browser inference. More sophisticated AI models will undoubtedly run efficiently on Wasm, pushing the boundaries of what's achievable on client-side and edge devices. A significant accelerator for Wasm AI will be the evolving role of WebGPU, providing modern API access to GPU capabilities for highly parallel computations essential for AI model inference. For a deeper dive into the capabilities beyond the browser, explore the possibilities of WebAssembly on the edge.WebAssembly is poised to revolutionize AI inference at the edge, offering unparalleled performance, portability, and security.

It’s something weirder. Something that started with a chatbot and now threatens the one thing we all reflexively do: googling stuff.See, OpenAI just made ChatGPT . And not in a half-baked, “we added a little Bing” kind of way. No, this is different. ChatGPT now has live browsing, GPT-4o baked in by default, and a UI that actually makes you want to ask it things instead of CTRL+T’ing your way to Google.What does that mean? Well… imagine if your IDE, Stack Overflow, and Chrome had a baby and it never made you look at a sponsored link again.This might sound like just another AI feature drop. But for Google? It’s existential. For the rest of us? It’s the start of a new interface era.Remember when smartphones changed how we used the web? We’re there again except this time, it’s not screens that are changing. It’s .€50 free credits for 30 days trial Promo code: The new question isn’t “what do I click?” It’s “what do I ask?”And that shift… is seismic.Let’s break down what just happened, how it changes the game for Google, and why you yes, you are probably part of the test group for the next version of the internet.So here’s what happened: OpenAI rolled out a new version of ChatGPT, and it casually snuck in a nuke.Now when you open ChatGPT (especially if you’re a Plus user), it’s no longer just a chatbot. It’s a full-blown AI-powered search interface with browsing enabled by default, image generation in-line, GPT-4o running everything, and  search results pages.No “Top Stories.” No SEO junk. No cookie banners asking for your soul. Just straight-up answers.And the best part? It feels fast. Not “scroll through a hundred links and ads” fast actual useful fast. The kind of fast where you type a messy thought like “how do I prep for a data science interview this week if I only know Python and vibes”… and it gives you something solid.What OpenAI quietly did here was break the decades-old browser model. Instead of websites loading in tabs, the info  condensed, conversational, and ready to use. There’s no UI clutter. No rabbit holes. Just results that feel like talking to a smart friend who doesn’t try to sell you a mattress halfway through.This isn’t just AI search. This is .Which brings us to the new browser war. Except this time, the browser  Chrome vs. Firefox. It’s .One gives you links. The other gives you .And spoiler: language is winning.Let’s be real Google didn’t become a trillion-dollar juggernaut because it had the best answers. It won because it became a .You didn’t search. You .And for 20+ years, that mental muscle memory open tab → type question → scan links was unshakable. Google didn’t need to out-innovate. It just had to protect the habit. Even if the results were 40% SEO sludge, 30% Reddit threads, and 20% ads pretending not to be ads… people stayed.Because what OpenAI is doing isn’t just better tech it’s . And that’s terrifying for Google.You used to search, click, scan, scroll, repeat.And it responds like it  what you want, not like it’s trying to game the algorithm.Google tried to patch this behavior shift with AI snapshots the weird boxes at the top of some search pages that summarize stuff. But users can feel the difference between duct tape and design. ChatGPT wasn’t patched with AI. It was  around it.The result? People are starting to  open a new tab. They’re asking ChatGPT instead.And every time that happens, a tiny piece of Google’s moat cracks.This isn’t about who has the smartest model or flashiest demo. It’s about who controls the default way people access knowledge.OpenAI didn’t just build a better engine. They rewired the steering wheel.Here’s where it gets spicy.OpenAI isn’t just trying to replace search they’re coming for the entire way we interact with the internet.Google gives you a pile of links. ChatGPT gives you a .And that’s a fundamentally different vision of what the web could be.OpenAI’s move isn’t just about finding information faster it’s about  faster. You can now ask ChatGPT to book you a trip, write a summary, draft an email, generate a thumbnail, or debug some code all in the same window. It’s like having a browser, a research assistant, a junior dev, and a meme lord rolled into one interface.This isn’t just an AI. This is a new operating system for thought.Everything happens in one continuous thread. No bouncing between apps. No Chrome with 47 open tabs (RIP your RAM). No hunting through 8 Medium posts to find one decent how-to.You just ask. It just does.And that shift from  to  is what makes OpenAI’s vision so powerful.Google is still playing the “find and fetch” game. OpenAI wants to play “understand and do.”It’s a subtle shift. But it’s the kind of subtle that rewrites entire industries.Google: “Here are 10 links about how to build a Shopify app.”ChatGPT: “Here’s a working example. Want me to deploy it?”That’s not search. That’s automation through language.Plot twist: the most surprising character in this AI drama isn’t OpenAI or Google. It’s .Yes. Bing. The search engine you only opened by accident. The punchline of every tech joke for the last decade.Guess who’s laughing now?Because while everyone’s eyes were on OpenAI and Google, Microsoft quietly slipped into the driver’s seat. They invested billions into OpenAI, baked GPT into every product from Word to Windows, and here’s the kicker gave ChatGPT its browsing power via Bing.That’s right. Every time you type a question into ChatGPT’s browser mode, Bing is behind the scenes fetching the data. You just don’t see it and that’s the point.Microsoft figured out something genius: You don’t have to beat Google at search.be the plumbing for the thing that does.Honestly? It’s the best glow-up in tech since Internet Explorer quietly vanished.And while Google scrambles to defend its castle, Microsoft is building secret tunnels underneath the moat. They’re not trying to replace search. They’re trying to Call it BingGPT. Call it Clippy’s revenge. Either way, Microsoft is now in the room and they’re not here to spectate.If you think Google’s just sitting there eating glue while OpenAI eats its lunch think again.They’re not out. They’re just… overthinking it. (Classic Google.)Enter  and Google’s answer to the generative AI wave. At I/O 2024, Google demoed multi-modal agents that could listen, see, understand video in real-time, and even track what you’re holding using your phone camera. Impressive? Absolutely. Usable? Not quite.Where OpenAI is shipping sleek, focused features that users can access , Google’s approach is more… let’s call it . Astra is still a research project. Gemini is stuck behind product layers like Bard, Gemini Advanced, or Gemini-in-Gmail, depending on which version of Google you randomly stumbled into that day.The experience feels like Google’s trying to duct tape AI onto a thousand existing apps instead of asking, “What if we started over?”And that’s the real issue. Google is caught between two worlds:The ad empire it  protect ( all those SEO links that ChatGPT skips).And the future it  to build.But every time it hesitates every product delay, every cautious rollout, every confusing brand name change OpenAI just drops something cleaner, faster, and more fun.Even Google’s AI-powered Search Generative Experience (SGE) feels like a beta that accidentally escaped into the wild. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it breaks. And sometimes it just makes stuff up and shrugs.Meanwhile, ChatGPT users are out here planning their vacations, writing code, solving math problems, and asking follow-ups all without opening a single new tab.Google’s not dead. Far from it.But it’s stuck in a weird place: too big to pivot fast, too smart to ignore what’s coming.If you’re a developer, writer, builder, or terminal-dweller this shift should have you  in equal measure.Because AI-first search doesn’t just change  we find things. It changes .You wrote content for search engines.You optimized for keywords.You begged the SEO gods for mercy.You optimize for .And the AI decides whether your work is .That’s equal parts terrifying and thrilling.On one hand, the chaos is real:No one knows what prompt will surface their content.Attribution is a coin toss.And “click-through rate” is starting to mean nothing.But on the other hand? This is :Want to build tools that rank higher in AI outputs? Prompt-chain them smart.Want to surface niche data that’s usually buried under SEO sludge? Train a custom GPT or API to expose it cleanly.Want to create utilities that people can use  the chat interface? Plugins, GPTs, and embedded actions are wide open.The web’s new frontier isn’t a homepage. It’s a .And guess what? It runs on the same stuff we already love: JSON, APIs, clever hacks, and duct-taped workflows. Devs now have a new interface to design  and .This is the moment where “frontend” stops meaning “website” and starts meaning “conversation.”So yeah SEO might be dying. But ? That’s just getting started.Let’s have the uncomfortable conversation:Is this the end of the open web as we know it?Because here’s the new reality: Your carefully crafted blog post, tutorial, or how-to guide might not be  anymore. It might just be .LLMs don’t link out like search engines. They synthesize. Compress. Reword. Which means the credit and the  don’t always make it back to the source.And if you’re a content creator, small business, or dev running a helpful niche site? That’s an existential problem. You built for visibility. Now you’re background noise in a chatbot’s answer.But here’s the flip side and it’s important: Great content still matters. In fact, it might matter more than ever.Because LLMs are only as smart as the data they train on. The long-tail content deep dives, personal experience posts, oddball forum threads those are gold. Even GPT-4o needs something to eat.If you write clearly, teach well, and explain things no one else does… you might surface in a chat even when Google buried you on page 9.If you build small tools, calculators, or niche datasets, you might become a go-to source for AI agents looking to do more than just talk.If you make things for humans, and not just rankings, LLMs might finally be your best audience.So no SEO isn’t dead. It’s just mutating into something weirder: Prompt Engine Optimization.Where you’re not just ranking for keywords. You’re making your work LLM-legible. Context-rich. Voice-driven. Answer-ready.It’s the end of the old web. But maybe, just maybe it’s the rebirth of the  one.Something strange is happening.It’s subtle. You might not even notice it at first. But scroll through Reddit, dev forums, Twitter (fine X), and you’ll hear it:“I haven’t googled anything in days.” “ChatGPT got me through an entire workday.” “I asked it to plan my wedding and debug my Docker container same conversation.”People aren’t just  ChatGPT. They’re  quietly, habitually, permanently.And that’s the real revolution.For the first time in decades, the default way we interact with the internet is shifting. We’re moving from  to .No more bouncing between tabs.No more digging through 15 sites to compare visa requirements or CSS workarounds.No more rage-Googling “why is my React useEffect not working” at 2 AM only to end up on a page that hasn’t been updated since jQuery was cool.Now? You just ask. And you stay.This shift is even bigger than smartphones or app stores. Those were interface changes. This is a  change.We’re no longer browsing the web. We’re  it.It’s not about surfing the internet. It’s about  it.And whether you’re a dev, a writer, a teacher, or a casual doomscrollerthat changes how you work, learn, and build.What started as a chatbot has quietly evolved into something that could dethrone the most powerful tech company of the last two decades. Not because it’s “smarter” but because it’s .ChatGPT didn’t just ship a new feature. It changed the entire  of the internet.This isn’t about who wins a benchmark. It’s about who owns .Open tab → type → scroll → click? That was Google’s world.Prompt → answer → action? That’s ChatGPT’s.And in that world, the next dominant tech platform won’t be a browser, a search engine, or even an app. It’ll be an interface that listens.We’re not just searching anymore. We’re  with something that feels less like a tool and more like a co-pilot.Google still has the scale, the users, and the infrastructure. But OpenAI has the momentum, the product clarity, and the .This is more than a battle over search. This is a fight over what the internet  and who it’s built for.Developers, creators, builders: we are officially in the .So tinker. Break things. Optimize for conversations instead of clicks. Because the old web isn’t just changing it’s  now.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>So, tech salaries stopped climbing now what? we are not hiring right now, the new normal.</title><link>https://dev.to/devlinktips/so-tech-salaries-stopped-climbing-now-what-we-are-not-hiring-right-now-the-new-normal-41dd</link><author>Devlink Tips</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 21:47:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[There was a time when being a developer felt like a cheat code.You could post your GitHub in a Slack thread and get a $200K offer the next day. Everyone was hiring. Startups were throwing equity like candy. FAANG engineers were hopping companies every 18 months just to pad their TC.The tech salary rocketship hit escape velocity and then ran out of fuel mid-orbit.Now in 2025, the landscape is different. Even  devs are getting ghosted after final interviews. Recruiters are slow to respond (if at all). “We’re not hiring right now” has become the default auto-reply. Companies that once offered $400K for “Senior CRUD Engineer IV” are trimming staff and freezing headcount.If you’re feeling anxious, you’re not alone.This isn’t a doomscroll article. It’s not about blaming the market, VCs, AI, or Gen Z. It’s about facing the shift and figuring out how to survive it with your sanity (and skillset) intact.€50 free credits for 30 days trial Promo code: You don’t need to panic. But you do need to adapt. Let’s break down what actually happened and what devs should be doing now, not next quarter.Let’s be honest: .Between 2015 and 2021, tech felt unstoppable. Startups were raising pre-seed rounds with nothing but pitch decks. VC money was being lit on fire just to win engineer sign-ons. Even junior developers were getting six-figure packages without ever touching Kubernetes.The world shut down, but tech didn’t. Instead, it exploded.Zoom calls replaced onsite interviewsBurnout, layoffs, and fear? Yeah… but with  tooDev jobs became recession-proof-ish. Even folks mid-career switching from retail, teaching, or hospitality were landing roles with a 3-month bootcamp and a good LinkedIn headline.Companies weren’t just hiring they were  developers. Amazon, Google, Facebook? They weren’t building they were stockpiling talent just to keep it away from competitors.It was the golden age of:Unlimited PTO that everyone pretended to useYou didn’t have to stand out. You just had to be But like all good things that move too fast it broke.What started as a “small round of layoffs” in early 2022 quickly became an avalanche.Meta. Google. Amazon. Stripe. Salesforce. Shopify. All cutting jobs. Publicly. Repeatedly.Suddenly, LinkedIn feeds weren’t filled with “Just accepted a new offer!” they were filled with “My role was impacted. I’m open to opportunities.”One minute you were running a CRUD app in Next.js and collecting $300K. The next? You were doing LeetCode problems on a Saturday and trying not to refresh your inbox.capital wasn’t cheap anymoreCompanies over-hired during the remote boom and realized they needed… less, and execs thought ChatGPT would replace half the team by Q2Public markets punished bloated tech orgs, so execs had to “rightsize” to look lean again“Entry-level role” = requires 3 years of experience + cloud cert + telepathyInterview loops became harderMore competition for fewer rolesCompanies now expect full-stack + infra + DevOps + “culture add”Programs that promised $150K jobs post-grad quietly stopped advertising numbersThis wasn’t just a market shift it was a .“Tech always needs more devs”“FAANG will always be hiring”“Remote work is the future (and the future is now)”Hiring still exists. But it’s different. Leaner. Sharper. Less patient. More skeptical.Here’s the truth: software engineering isn’t dying.It’s just not the cozy, overpaid utopia it used to be. The $400K comp for maintaining internal dashboards? Yeah, those days are over. The “we just raised Series B and we’re hiring 200 engineers by Q3” vibes? Gone.But the  hasn’t disappeared. What’s changed is how companies  that work.Can you ship usable stuff with minimal oversight?Can you own a project, not just write functions?Are you a force multiplier or a ticket taker? who can go from CLI to UIEngineers who can self-manage in async/remote settingsPeople who understand cost, uptime, and user value, not just syntaxYou don’t need to be a 10x rockstar ninja guru unicorn. But you  need to show that you’re And that means showing actual results. Not just “look I used Astro + Tailwind + Supabase on this to-do app.”The dev job still exists. But the  From comfy to competitive.If you’re still chasing the old path CS degree → LeetCode → FAANG you’re gonna have a bad time.Because the companies hiring in 2025? They care less about where you studied and more about what you’ve built, shipped, or improved.1. Build things. Small things. Ugly things. Useful things.Not just portfolio fluff. Build tools you’d actually use.Bonus points if you make other developers’ lives easier (CLI tools, dashboards, scripts, etc.)Blog about them. Document your pain. People will follow that more than your GitHub stars.Learn how to get an idea from 0 → MVP → deployed.Backend (Node, Go, Python, etc.)Frontend (doesn’t need to be React just usable)DevOps (Docker, CI/CD, basic infra)You don’t need to be perfect just competent in Everyone knows React very few people know how to optimize large-scale forms in React with 500k rows and 0 jank.Examples of high-value niches:Browser automation (e.g., Puppeteer + AI + scraping)Internal tools for boring businesses (CRM, HR, medical systems)AI prompt pipelines (if you can show results not just buzzwords)4. Learn to market yourself (even if it feels cringe)A clean GitHub alone won’t get you noticed anymore.Write Twitter/X/LinkedIn threads explaining problems you solved.Drop before/after screenshots.Show code + results. That’s the new résumé.5. Know the cost of what you buildCompanies are cost-aware now.If you can say, “This change cut infra costs by 22%” you just hired yourself.Learn how to optimize for performance, scale, cost, and simplicity.In 2025, you don’t need to be a genius. But you need to be a builder. A communicator. A finisher.The jobs are still out there. They’re just looking for people who solve problems, not just write syntax.If you’ve been stuck on the job-hunting treadmill since 2023, chances are… you’ve been lied to.Not maliciously. Just outdated advice passed around so many times, it became scripture.But the market in 2025? It doesn’t care what the grindset YouTubers said. It’s running on a whole new OS.“Just do LeetCode every day”Look, algorithm practice . It sharpens problem-solving and can get you past technical rounds.But if all you have is 200 solved questions and no projects, you’re just a human GPT clone. Most jobs now don’t even ask for DSA unless it’s a Big Tech role and even then, they  want:So yeah… do LeetCode. But don’t  do LeetCode.“Apply to 100 jobs a week with one résumé”Spray-and-pray hasn’t worked in years. Recruiters get flooded. ATS filters everything.If your application doesn’t match the job description or clearly say , it’s instant archive.A better use of your time? Apply to  jobs. But write a short custom blurb. Show a relevant project. Reference their stack. Show you’re not a bot.“I got a CS degree so I’m safe”Cool. So did half the industry.Degrees can open doors. But now? Companies care about how fast you can:If your last commit was in college, they’re moving on.But that badge doesn’t make you untouchable anymore. You’re now competing with ex-FAANG folks  after their layoffs not ones resting on titles.Nice you made it through. That takes effort.But you still need to  your skills:Projects that solve real problemsClarity of thought when explaining your workOtherwise, you’re just another résumé in the pile.Old tricks don’t work in a lean market.You can’t fake passion with buzzwords. You can’t brute-force your way into a job anymore. You have to show that you care and that you can The job market didn’t vanish. It just stopped showing up in the usual places.Forget the dream of cold-DMing a FAANG recruiter and waking up to a $300K offer. That’s not the move anymore.But here’s where the  is in 2025:Healthcare, insurance, legaltech, logistics, B2B toolingThey’re not flashy. They don’t have landing pages with 3D scroll animations. But they’re stable, messy, and very willing to pay developers who can clean up legacy chaos.If you can take a PHP monolith and turn it into something testable, you’re worth gold in these fields.They don’t care if you have a degree. They care if you can ship fast, debug well, and communicate clearly.Bonus: they’re remote by default.No VC. No boss. Just you, some caffeine, and a Notion board.It’s not passive income magic but it  a way to build your own opportunity. Make something small, useful, ugly. Iterate. Launch. Repeat.Best part? It builds  that you can identify problems and solve themwhich is exactly what hiring managers want to see.The smart money isn’t on building the next ChatGPT.It’s on building tools  AI:Domain-specific prompt pipelinesClean frontends for messy LLM outputCompanies want people who understand what AI can do If you can bridge that gap, you’re not replaceable you’re essential.The wild west is over, but real remote roles still exist. They just:Require asynchronous communication skillsExpect you to self-manage and hit deadlines without hand-holdingNail that combo, and you can still work from anywhere. Even your kitchen. Even in Crocs.If you zoom out from the hype machine, you’ll see:There’s still demand for real devsThe problems are harder, but more interestingYou don’t need to be famous you just need to be usefulThis isn’t another “Top 10 Bootcamps” list. This is the  that developers are using right now to stay sharp, stay connected, and stay paid.These aren’t perfect, but they’ve helped devs bridge income gaps or find long-term clients: real-world, shipping-focused online dev courses starter templates and real-world SaaS blueprints the dev power tool for your OSthe next-gen collaborative IDE modern terminal with command memory and AIif you want Node.js but faster and less cursedDon’t just apply Don’t just build The dev community is still out here. Just in smaller, smarter pockets.You don’t need to quit tech. You don’t need to learn ten new frameworks. You don’t need to go back to school, grind LeetCode 12 hours a day, or build the next billion-dollar startup from your mom’s basement.But you  need to face reality:The easy-mode dev job market is over. The new game is harder, faster, and less forgiving. And you need to adapt to win.You are your own product. Learn to build, explain, and show your work. Go deep into weird problems that real people need solved. Side projects, open source, weird ideas these matter now more than résumés. Find a circle. Share your work. Boost others.This isn’t the end of software jobs. It’s just the end of  ones.And honestly? That’s kind of exciting.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Self-hosting like a final boss: what I actually run on my home lab (and why)</title><link>https://dev.to/devlinktips/self-hosting-like-a-final-boss-what-i-actually-run-on-my-home-lab-and-why-48k1</link><author>Devlink Tips</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 21:41:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Self-hosting in 2025 feels a bit like building a secret base in your garage.It starts innocently enough.“I just want to run my own notes app.” Next thing you know, you’re port-forwarding through your ISP’s double NAT, hardening SSH keys, and explaining to your router why your Jellyfin server absolutely needs port 8920 open .But here’s the thing: self-hosting isn’t just a hobby. It’s a .You’re reclaiming control from the Googles and Dropboxes of the world. You’re saying:“Nah, I’ll run my own Git repo and media center and maybe a full-blown CI/CD pipeline in my closet, thank you very much.”And yeah, it breaks sometimes. Your backups fail silently.

And when it works, it feels .€50 free credits for 30 days trial Promo code: This guide isn’t some Docker 101 fluff or “how to spin up Nextcloud in 3 clicks.” It’s a full-on walkthrough of what I actually run, why I run it, and how I (barely) keep it together.Because in a world where everything is SaaS, running your own stack feels like a superpower.Before you self-host anything, you need . No, not AWS credits. Real, humming, heat-emitting hardware that lives under your desk or next to your modem, blinking like it has a purpose.Here’s what I’ve learned (the hard way): You don’t need a server farm. But you do need something reliable, quiet, and low power unless you enjoy high electricity bills and fan noise while you sleep.Raspberry Pi (if you can find one):Great for: basic apps, low power, nerd credBad for: databases, transcoding, anything RAM-hungryTip: Only go here if you’re okay with arm64 weirdnessBest all-rounder: runs everything, sips power, fits in a drawerPricey depending on modelUse this if you’re serious about having 24/7 uptimeOld ThinkCentre or OptiPlex:Dirt cheap on eBay or local classifiedsLoud fans, higher power drawBut for $80, you get a quad-core i5 and 16GB of RAM? Not bad.Once your iron is sorted, you’ll want to connect it in a way that doesn’t make future-you hate past-you.Assign a static IP on your LAN so services don’t randomly vanish after a router reboot.You’ll need to forward ports like:22 (SSH but use a different port and keys)Whatever else your services need (Jellyfin, Gitea, etc.)Avoid UPnP like it’s haunted.External access (but safely):Tailscale (my top pick VPN mesh with zero config)Cloudflare Tunnel (tunneling HTTP apps with SSL)Ngrok (quick testing, not for prod)These let you access your self-hosted services from anywhere  exposing your IP to every botnet on the planet.Unless you’re storing terabytes of anime or movie backups, an SSD will make your self-hosted stack feel way snappier. And fewer moving parts = fewer 3am surprises.Once you’ve got stable iron and clean pipes, you’re ready to install the one tool that will carry you through this entire self-hosting journey: .There’s a golden rule in self-hostingIf it’s not in Docker, it’s not real. And if it’s not backed up, it’s already gone.Let’s talk about the foundational tools you’ll install once and then reuse for  else.If you’re self-hosting without Docker in 2025, you’re either:or someone who  enjoys debugging Python dependenciesFor the rest of us, Docker is life. Pair it with , and you’re spinning up entire stacks with one command.Then drop a , run , and boom: instant service.You don’t  to use Portainer, but… it’s like training wheels for Docker that you never outgrow.Restart or rebuild servicesDeploy new apps without touching the CLIDocker Hub pushes updates. But your containers? Stuck in 2022 until  manually rebuild them. fixes that by checking for new versions and updating your containers automatically.Set it to check every X hours and you never have to worry about CVEs ruining your Sunday.What’s better than hosting your own apps?Knowing when they go down.Uptime Kuma is a beautiful, self-hosted uptime monitor. Think of it as your own mini status page.Then set up monitors for your services and get Telegram/email/Discord alerts when something dies (probably your reverse proxy again ). (GUI for scheduled backups) (CLI-based, solid and encrypted)Just plain  to an external driveYou don’t need a 3–2–1 backup strategy worthy of a Fortune 500. But at least automate backing up your . Future you will owe you a beer.Here’s the thing about self-hosting: you try a lot, break a lot, and eventually settle on a core group of apps you can’t live without. These are the ones I’ve stuck with and a few I respectfully uninstalled with fire.Markdown, local-first, graph-based note-takingLooks like Obsidian but is open source and yourI run it in a browser via a container + synced with Syncthing across devicesGreat Evernote replacementFull desktop and mobile syncBonus: Encrypted notes if you like writing secrets like “todo: fix my Nginx config”Yes, I tried self-hosting email. Yes, I regret it.You  do it. But unless you understand DKIM, SPF, and reverse DNS , Gmail will ghost your emails forever.TL;DR: self-hosted email is like running your own post office in 2025. It’s technically impressive. But you will suffer.Plex alternative, 100% open sourceNo tracking, no sign-ins, just stream your filesI run it with hardware acceleration enabled on Intel iGPU = butter-smooth 4KThink: Spotify but from your own MP3 collectionAlso works with Subsonic-compatible mobile apps telling you how to use this, just saying it works really well in a containerGoogle results without GoogleGreat for making your browser search bar actually privateSelf-hosted bookmark managerReplaces Pocket and lets you keep links organized without feeding an algorithmTurns  into an RSS feedI follow newsletters, blogs, even YouTube channels  subscribing on-platformGitHub clone you can run on a potatoGreat for small projects, personal wikis, automation scriptsI use it to automate backups, send alerts from uptime monitors, even tweet from cron jobs (don’t judge me)Team Wiki, Notion-style, markdown-basedBeautiful, fast, and plays nice with Git for versioned documentation → Too slow, too bloated. I just use Syncthing + external drives → Great if you’re into smart homes. I am not. I like my switches dumb and dependable. → Still good, just moved back to 1Password due to mobile autofill painThese are the real ones. The apps that stuck. The stack that makes self-hosting actually useful, not just experimental.Self-hosting turns your home into a tiny datacenter and if you’re not careful, . Once you expose services to the internet, you’re playing a game of “how fast can I get scanned by China, Russia, and your neighbor’s hacked webcam.”Here’s how I keep my stuff reasonably safe (and how you can too).Want to expose your apps to the world? Cool then use one of these  you  anything public:: mesh VPN, zero config. Just install and forget. Perfect for personal/private access.: tunnels HTTP services with auto SSL + obfuscation.If it’s on the internet, it will get brute-forced. Guaranteed. or : block everything by default except what you explicitly open.: scans logs for bad login attempts and bans IPs after too many tries.Then configure for your SSH or web server. It’ll stop script kiddies cold. (stored in a password manager) if the app supports it on services like Portainer, Uptime Kuma, etc.If the app doesn’t support auth? Put it behind Nginx with a password file. Easy win.No HTTP in 2025. Use Let’s Encrypt with:Nginx or Traefik (with automatic certificate generation)Cloudflare proxy + full SSL modeOr Caddy server (it auto-SSLs everything out of the boxHard drives die. USB sticks get corrupted. Accidentally ? Gone.Back up your  files, configs, and data volumesAutomate daily or weekly jobs with:Store copies : cloud bucket, another drive, external SSD, whateverNo exposed services without tunnels or SSLBlock everything by defaultWatch your logs (and block bad actors)Password-protect everythingBack up like your next job depends on itLet’s be real: self-hosting isn’t for everyone. It’s not some perfect replacement for Google Workspace or Notion. It’s not magically cheaper or easier. It’s definitely not faster than just clicking “Sign up with Google.”But for the right kind of person?Because I want to understand my stack. I like knowing what runs where, why it fails, and how to fix it.Because I don’t want to be dependent on five different Big Tech dashboards. One day they’ll sunset your favorite tool. Mine’s still running. Breaking and fixing stuff is half the fun. It feels good to run your own digital HQ.You hate CLI, YAML, or Googling error logs.You don’t have time to check if your services are still up after a power outage.You need perfect reliability and push notifications at 3 a.m.? Yeah… go with Notion.That said self-hosting isn’t all or nothing. You can run just one service and call it a win. Your own notes app, your own photo backup, or your own music streaming setup? That alone makes the journey worth it.Start small. Learn. Level up. You’ll be surprised how far it takes you.If you want to go deeper, these are my go-to resources:Self-hosting isn’t some elite hacker-only zone.You don’t need to build your own kernel, learn Go, or compile Nginx from source (unless you’re into that pain). What you need is curiosity, patience, and maybe a second-hand ThinkCentre.Start with one service something dumb and fun. Like a local notes app or your own Plex alternative. Then slowly add more. Add backups. Add a VPN tunnel. Fix a broken container. Celebrate. Repeat until you’ve built something that feels .Because that’s what this is really about: .In 2025, self-hosting is less about saving money and more about owning your data, learning how systems work, and being okay with breaking stuff once in a while.You don’t have to be perfect. You just have to be persistent.So go spin up that container. Expose that port (safely). And remember: every DevOps wizard was once a confused person staring at a  that wouldn’t start.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>10 hands-on Docker projects that’ll actually level up your skills not just hello-world junk</title><link>https://dev.to/devlinktips/10-hands-on-docker-projects-thatll-actually-level-up-your-skills-not-just-hello-world-junk-1mjp</link><author>Devlink Tips</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 21:24:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Let’s be honest running  doesn’t mean you “know Docker.”You’ve probably followed a dozen YouTube tutorials, watched a few folks make a container dance in their terminal, maybe even got a Django app running once before it mysteriously broke after a restart.But here’s the catch: Docker isn’t something you understand just by watching.

Write a multi-stage DockerfileBoom. Now your portfolio runs in a clean production image, separate from all that  mess.If you want hot reloading in dev mode too, you can mount your local folder into a  container and run :Everyone tells you to make a portfolio site. But deploying it  in Docker forces you to think like an engineer, not just a developer:What does “production-ready” actually mean?Why is my container 700MB?Where do I separate build vs run?Once you master this, you’re no longer the junior who ships containers with 300MB of unused dependencies.A classic Linux + Apache + MySQL + PHP (LAMP) stack using .

🧠 Why I Built ItI live in Nigeria, where delivery is a daily hustle — from dispatch riders to food couriers to friends running errands. One constant?
  
  
  I wanted a dead-simple tool that let riders share their live location without installing an app or creating an account. So I built Trackpilot — a one-feature app where you just create a delivery and send a link.
Supabase: Database + Realtime + Row-level securityReact + Vite: Fast frontend scaffoldTailwind CSS: Styling on turbo modeGeolocation API: To get rider location
  
  
  - Supabase Realtime + Row Update: For live map updates
Rider creates a delivery with name/locationApp generates a public  linkGPS updates are pushed to Supabase every 5 secondsViewer sees the rider move live on a map (Leaflet.js)No backend server. No login system. No Firebase spaghetti.
  
  
  Just browser → Supabase → map.

But let’s be honest so far, they’re mostly just clever talkers. Impressive? Sure, but passive.The real magic happens when AI stops chit chatting and starts .Imagine giving your AI the power to:Pull real-time stock pricesClean up a messy spreadsheetAuto-tag customer ticketsOr sync Jira with Notion without crying — try it (it’s worth it)That’s what MCP (Model Context Protocol) unlocks. It’s basically the  a universal, standardized way to plug your LLM into the real world. Your APIs, your tools, your data. You expose capabilities; the AI calls them like a polite guest who read the manual.Think of it like giving your AI agent superpowers. Instead of “Can I help you with anything else today?” it’s now:“Want me to update your Trello board, check your Stripe balance, and book a Zoom call? Done.” And here’s the kicker: barely anyone is building this right now.€50 free credits for 30 days trial Promo code: If the chatbot boom was Gen-1,  the “app store” moment for AI agents. Only, it hasn’t gone mainstream yet. Which means if you start now, you’re early.In this guide, you’ll learn how to:Understand how MCP actually works (without losing your sanity),Build your own MCP server using Python or TypeScript,Connect it with real AI agents (Claude, Cloudflare, MindsDB),And monetiit, it. Yes! Even as a side project.Ready to move from  to ?Let’s ditch the jargon for a sec.MCP (Model Context Protocol) is how large language models like Claude go from “text-only” geniuses to full-on digital assistants that can run tasks, fetch data, and interact with tools.MCP exposes 3 main types of things to your AI agent:You define functions like , , or . The AI sees them as . It figures out  to call them. Like giving your AI a Swiss Army knife and it actually knows which blade to use.Let’s say you have a config file, a user profile, or a knowledge base. Expose those as REST-like paths (, ) and the AI can interact with them intelligently.It’s like exposing your database… but in AI-speak.You can feed your AI extra context like cheat codes. Example: , , etc. Instead of reinventing the prompt wheel, MCP lets you store and reuse patterns.MCP is like giving your AI a smartphoneLocal storage = resourcesWithout it, your AI is like a bored genius locked in a room. With it? You’ve got an assistant that knows how to send invoices, analyze Excel sheets, and automate your workflow before you even open your laptop.Next up: , especially if you’re a developer looking for that next niche, profitable side project, or just cool stuff to build on weekends.When you realize MCP turns AI from a talker to a hacker.Let’s be blunt: MCP isn’t just another protocol. It’s the blueprint for how AI agents will actually  and  get to build what they use.Remember when mobile devs made bank building fart apps and flashlight toggles in the early days of the iPhone? We’re , except now it’s with AI tools that talk to APIs, clean data, and execute actions like a virtual assistant on steroids.Here’s the vibe: The world is full of workflows that suck (sadly). Most of them look like this:Log in → export → clean → uploadSummarize feedback manuallyNow imagine a world where Claude (or any LLM) can say:“Sure! I’ll fetch competitor prices from 3 sites, clean up the spreadsheet, and update your Notion page before your 9am.”Boom. That’s an agent powered by MCP tools you built.Examples of “weekend projects” that could earn you money:: Searches 5 job boards with filters, returns cleaned results.summarize_support_tickets: Converts Zendesk chaos into digestible trends.: Links tasks across teams without tears.: Sends daily email alerts if competitors change pricing.Easy to plug into Claude with MCPThe beauty of MCP is that it already plays nicely with things like: add a paywall to your MCP endpoint (per request, usage-based, or monthly). deploy globally, scale without crying.Anthropic’s future “Integrations” tab think early-stage app store for AI.Charge $5/month for your “CSV cleaner for Claude” tool.Offer 100 free requests, then switch to Stripe metering.Or go enterprise and plug into workflows via Slack + Claude agents.And here’s the part no one’s saying loudly enough:MCP is early. Really early. If you start building now, you’re not late you’re day 1.Alright, so you’re sold. You want to build a tool your AI agent can use. Time to strap in and ship your first MCP server.There are two solid routes depending on your vibe: Python devs who want fast local builds or hobby tools.(Or use  if you’re in the cool crowd.)This exposes a simple  tool your AI agent can now call like an API. just run the script connects via stdin/stdout. install , then  or  client for local ping Web devs, scale nerds, and anyone who wants .This lets Claude (or any agent) call  via MCP.And boom you’ve got a live MCP server, ready to take requests globally.Python = great for data tasks, local automation, quick protosCloudflare = great for global reach, fast APIs, web-native toolsHere’s a trick: Go scroll , , or  and look for pain points.If someone’s complaining about:You’ve likely just found an MCP tool waiting to be built.Next up:  from open-source MCP servers already out there (MindsDB, Stagehand, Jupyter, GitHub, and more).Before you go building yet another “Hello World” calculator for AI… why not look at what’s already working in the wild?There are already  open source, production-grade, and frankly underused.These aren’t just “examples” you can clone them, customize them, and learn from them. An open-source AI database that also acts as an MCP server.Connects to 200+ sources: MySQL, MongoDB, Slack, Gmail, Notion, Google Sheets…Turns your messy biz data into an  knowledge base.Supports SQL  natural language querying.“Hey Claude, summarize all feedback from negative Trustpilot reviews for product X.” A web browsing MCP server with scraping capabilities. LLMs + browsing = goldmine. Claude can now:Extract structured data from a page“Find top 10 AI podcasts from Apple’s site and return name + rating.” Lets LLMs talk directly to Jupyter notebooks. Yes, really. Claude can now:Run data science pipelines“Analyze this CSV of Shopify sales and flag unusual dips.” Observability layer for MCP interactions.Log every request/responseUnderstand tool call patternsDebug AI behavior in real time“Why did Claude ignore this config file? What tool did it call instead?”Already have a FastAPI app? You’re 90% done.Exposes your endpoints to MCPAdds tool metadata + discoveryPlays nice with Claude instantlyYour in-house CRM API becomes callable via AI.Want Claude (or another AI client) to use any of these?Point the AI to your server via MCP configDefine the tools + resources it can accessLet it do the rest the LLM handles when/how to call how  to shoot yourself in the foot with best practices, common pitfalls, and how to market your server like a dev pro.Okay, so you’re building your first MCP tool. Here’s how to  and how to make sure people actually use it.1. Secure it like an adult (not a weekend hacker)MCP tools can trigger actions. That’s power. With great power comes… really dumb security mistakes if you’re not careful.Validate all inputs (, type checks, etc.)Use API keys or token-based auth if your MCP tool isn’t meant to be publicLimit LLM input to only the routes or actions you exposeLet a prompt like “delete everything” call a  toolAssume AI will never get creative with malformed input2. Build Claude-first, but don’t Claude-lockRight now, Anthropic’s Claude is the only LLM with official MCP support. But that won’t be true for long.Tip: Design your MCP logic modularlyMake it easy to swap the client:Gemini, ChatGPT, or open-source tomorrowThis is the future equivalent of “mobile-first” dev for LLM agents.3. Market your server like a dev not a marketerYour MCP server isn’t going viral on its own. Here’s how to get devs (and AIs 👀) using it:Add it to a GitHub repo like: Share it on X/Twitter with  and Write a short post on IndieHackers: “I built a Claude tool that scrapes Hacker News headlines. AMA.”Record a 1-minute Loom demo and drop it on Product HuntPost in Discord servers for Claude/LLM/hacker devs: Add a “Deploy to Cloudflare” button and link to Stripe if you want to get paid.4. Start tiny. Iterate fast.Most of the best MCP tools are built in a day or two. Identify a painkiller (e.g. “clean CSVs with AI”) Build a FastMCP or Cloudflare worker + expose 1 tool Test with Claude + set up StripeThis isn’t theory. People are already making passive $$ with tools like:5. Use AI to build for AIYes, seriously. Tools like: or  (for AI pair programming), , or  (for writing code + docs)…make building an MCP server . You’re literally using AI to help build the interface  AI. That’s meta and smart.Here’s the big idea, in one line:MCP is how AI agents move from passive brains to powerful doers.And  the developer are in the perfect spot to build the interface they use to operate in the real world.Talking to 200+ data sources via MindsDB,Syncing with tools like Notion, Jira, or GitHub…You can now ship it as an MCP tool, .MCP = The “API layer” for LLMs like ClaudeYou define , , and Build with  or Cloudflare Workers (TypeScript)Monetize with Stripe, scale with Cloudflare, and test locallyLearn from open-source giants like MindsDB, Stagehand, OpikMarket it like a dev: GitHub, Twitter, Product HuntStart stupid small. Ship fast. Iterate. Profit.Here’s your dev starter pack:So…ready to ship your first tool? If you do one, please post in the comments and share how you did and what?Remember, sharing is caring. 🫶 Thank you in advance!Claude (and the future of AI agents) is waiting to use it.Don’t just watch the next AI wave be the one building the surfboards.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Your laptop can run a full devops stack here’s how I set mine up</title><link>https://dev.to/devlinktips/your-laptop-can-run-a-full-devops-stack-heres-how-i-set-mine-up-260g</link><author>Devlink Tips</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 21:00:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The internet loves throwing DevOps buzzwords at you: CI/CD. Observability. Infrastructure as Code. And right after that they hand you a Terraform template with a $300/month AWS footprint.But here’s the thing:You don’t need cloud credits or a company login to .You can build a complete DevOps lab Git server, CI/CD, monitoring, deployment workflows  Yes, seriously.No fake “local emulation.”No “learn DevOps in theory.”I’m talking about actually pushing code, triggering builds, deploying containers, tracking metrics all from your machine.Because I was broke.And impatient.And I wanted to experiment without waiting for Terraform to provision an EC2 in some forgotten region.€50 free credits for 30 days trial Promo code: This article walks you through:How I glued them togetherAnd how you can spin up your own self-contained DevOps playground (in a few hours, not days)Before I started building this lab, I asked the same question you’re probably thinking:“Can’t I just get a free AWS/GCP trial and test things there?”Sure. And by the time you set up IAM roles, wait 10 minutes for an EC2 instance, and accidentally forget to delete a bucket, you’ll have spent more time (and money) than you wanted.Here’s why  wins for learning, testing, and tinkering.No surprise bills. No “you’ve exceeded your free tier” emails at 3am. Just you, your laptop, and the stack you control. Run it all without touching your wallet.2. deeper understanding of infrastructureCloud hides complexity. Locally, you touch every piece volumes, networks, ports, reverse proxies, monitoring agents. what makes systems work.3. full privacy and controlYou don’t need to expose anything online. No worries about leaking secrets, ports, or random containers running . It’s all sandboxed in your machine.4. portability and offline accessWi-Fi down? No problem. Your DevOps lab still runs. You can demo it, show it off, or test pipelines  cafes, flights, mountains (if you’re into that).5. experiment, reset, repeatBreak stuff, wipe it, rebuild from scratch. Your laptop becomes your personal staging environment fast feedback, no consequences.If you want to actually  (not just follow tutorials blindly), running things locally forces you to learn what matters.Let’s get this out of the way: You don’t need a $3,000 MacBook Pro or a liquid-cooled Linux rig named “KubernetesSlayer99” to run a DevOps lab.But you do need enough juice to avoid crying every time you run .Minimum setup (it works, but keep it light): (Docker will eat most of it) (HDD will slow things to a crawl) (logs + volumes add up fast) or Ideal setup (smooth experience): (no swapping, no lag) (especially with monitoring and container registry) (for creating clean VMs on-demand) Use Tailscale to access your lab from any device securelyIf your machine checks these boxes, you’re ready to host Git, CI/CD, monitoring, and more all from your own hardware.Now that your machine’s ready to hustle, let’s talk about what’s actually going inside this DevOps lab.This isn’t just Docker Hello World. We’re running real stuff like you’d see in production, but with fewer meetings.Here’s the core stack I run on my laptop:Git server Gitea or GitLab CEHost your own Git repositories. Push code, create pull requests, manage users all locally. Gitea is lightweight and perfect for laptops. If you have RAM to spare, try GitLab CE.CI/CD tool Jenkins or Drone CIRun tests, builds, deployments trigger pipelines on every push. Jenkins is old-school but powerful. Drone CI is lightweight, Docker-native, and fast.Container registry Harbor or local Docker registryPush and pull images without Docker Hub rate limits.Harbor has a slick UI and RBAC.Docker Registry UI is minimal and works well.Infrastructure automation Ansible or Bash scriptsSpin up, tear down, reconfigure all from code. Start with Ansible playbooks. Or write smart Bash scripts (sometimes Bash > YAML).Monitoring & metrics Prometheus + GrafanaReverse proxy Nginx or Traefik (optional)Route everything to local ports via nice  domains. Bonus: Add local SSL with mkcert to flex on yourself. run Kubernetes clusters locally store and rotate secrets securely service discovery & health checks define infra as code, even for local VMsThis is your  everything needed to build, test, deploy, and observe apps, just like the pros… but without the cloud bill.Here’s the deal: You could go full mad scientist and run 12 separate Docker commands and configure each service by hand.But we’re smarter than that.We’re using  to orchestrate everything — one config file to rule them all.Step 1: Set up a project folderYou’ll store all your services, volumes, configs, and compose files here. Keep it tidy.Step 2: build a Here’s a minimal example with , , and  to get started: break your stack into multiple Step 3: test each service locallyMake sure ports don’t clash. If you’re using WSL2 or macOS, use  directly. On native Linux, you’re golden.Save yourself from typing the same commands 50 times a day:Bonus #2: use  files for secrets and portsKeep sensitive stuff out of your Compose file. Use  like a grown-up dev:This setup gives you a fully functioning mini-DevOps stack in under 10 minutes and you can build on top of it however you like.Let’s be real I didn’t nail this lab on day one. I broke stuff. Lost data. Got weird errors with zero Google results.Here are the  moments I hit so you can avoid them like unused Jenkins plugins.Mistake #1: forgetting to persist volumesI spun up containers, configured everything… then nuked it all with a simple .💀 Goodbye config. Goodbye Git repos. Goodbye sanity. Always use  in Compose, and back up any important  paths. Better yet, mount a host directory during testing so you can inspect things locally.Mistake #2: port collisionsRunning Gitea on 3000? So is your local React app. Now your browser’s crying. Use  files to make ports configurable. If you’re going full chaos-mode, install ngrok or Tailscale and map services to cool dev URLs like .Mistake #3: hardcoding everythingI had secrets, tokens, and config values  like I didn’t care about life. Use  files + Docker secrets if you want to pretend to be responsible. At the very least, don’t git commit them. Ever.Mistake #4: running too much at onceI got greedy and ran GitLab, Jenkins, Prometheus, and a Minikube cluster all at once on 8GB RAM. Laptop fans: preparing for takeoff Start small. Run 2–3 services max while developing. Add the rest when you need them.Mistake #5: skipping health checksSome services silently fail or hang (especially CI). You don’t want to spend hours debugging a job that never ran because your container was stuck in . Use Docker  and a basic status page (like cAdvisor) to see what’s alive.Every mistake helped shape a more reliable lab. Now it runs on autopilot and I’ve built CI/CD pipelines faster than most cloud bootcamps.

I thought I’d just spin up a Git server, maybe a CI tool, mess around for a bit, and delete it all on Monday.But here’s what I didn’t expect:I learned more about networking than in any Udemy courseReverse proxies, port bindings, volume mounts I stopped copying configs and started  them.I broke stuff and got better at fixing itMost of my learning came from recovering broken builds, missing configs, and misbehaving containers. Every mistake made me more confident with Docker and Linux in general.I stopped being scared of YAMLSeriously. When you stare at 300 lines of  and make it work, cloud config files stop looking like encrypted manuscripts.I finally understood what “infrastructure as code” actually meansNot just defining services, but thinking about repeatability, modularity, backup, and rebuilds. Your lab becomes your infra playground but .And i got faster at real-world DevOps tasksWant to test Git hooks, build pipelines, or monitor logs like a pro? Do it in your own local stack, where no one’s watching and nothing costs $0.005 per minute.This wasn’t just “practice” it turned into  to grow in.You don’t need AWS credits. You don’t need a $100 Udemy course. You don’t need to beg your manager for a sandbox account.Then congratulations you’ve got everything you need to become dangerous in DevOps.Running a local DevOps lab forces you to think like an engineer:How do systems talk to each other?What happens when things go down?How do you automate recovery, deployment, monitoring all without duct tape?This isn’t fake learning. This is , minus the cloud bill and waiting time.You can try things. Break them. Rebuild them. All on your terms, on your machine, at your own pace.So yeah my stack might not be globally distributed. But it taught me more than a thousand cloud dashboards ever could.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[Boost]</title><link>https://dev.to/vaib/-hp0</link><author>Coder</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 20:48:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Next-Gen PWAs: AI and ML Drive Personalized & Predictive Web Experiences]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CreatiFlow: My Journey Building an AI-Powered Image Editing SaaS with Next.js 14, Cloudinary, and Stripe</title><link>https://dev.to/faarehahmed/creatiflow-my-journey-building-an-ai-powered-image-editing-saas-with-nextjs-14-cloudinary-and-2hln</link><author>Faareh Ahemed</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 20:44:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the last few years, the world of software has been rocked by two massive trends: the unstoppable rise of  and the dominance of the SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) model. AI is no longer a futuristic concept; it's a practical tool that's democratizing complex skills. At the same time, SaaS has changed how we access software, making powerful applications available to anyone with a browser.As a developer, I've been fascinated by the intersection of these two worlds. I wanted to build something that wasn't just a cool tech demo but a genuinely useful product that leverages AI to solve a real-world problem. That's why I'm thrilled to introduce my latest project: CreatiFlow is a fully-featured, AI-powered image editing application built as a . Think of it as a magic wand for your photos. It takes complex editing tasks that would typically require expensive software and years of experience like removing objects, filling in missing parts of an image, or enhancing old photos and makes them accessible with a single click.The  was to create an intuitive, powerful, and seamless experience for everyone, from content creators to developers who just need a quick edit for their project.CreatiFlow offers several AI-powered image transformation capabilities:: Add, remove, or expand content seamlessly: Clean up photos by removing unwanted objects: Repair and enhance old or damaged photos: Extract subjects from their backgrounds: Change colors in images while maintaining realismEach transformation feature uses credits, which users can purchase through the application's payment system.CreatiFlow follows a modern Next.js-based architecture with  and  for data manipulation.

I’ve always been fascinated by space-themed arcade games—fast-paced action, futuristic weapons, boss fights, and engaging power-ups. I wanted to build something that’s not only fun to play but also a testament to good software engineering and modern Python game design.A space shooter was perfect:
✔️ Visually engaging
✔️ Technically challenging
✔️ Ideal for experimenting with AI-generated logic, physics, and UI💡 Prompting Techniques that Worked Like Magic
Getting meaningful results from Amazon Q CLI wasn’t just about typing what I wanted—it was about speaking developer language to an AI.🧠 Here’s what I learned:
Be specific: "Build a 2D shooting game with 3 enemy types and 4 bullet patterns."
Use verbs that express behavior: “Add a leaderboard that updates after each game.”
Think modularly: “Make a separate module for particles, audio, UI, and state management.”
Request features with constraints: “Cap bullet count to 200 for performance.”
With clear intentions and a layered approach, I could guide Q CLI through building complex systems that normally take weeks.🧠 How AI Handled Classic Game Dev Challenges
Building any game manually involves dozens of steps—Q CLI accelerated the process dramatically. Here's how it tackled common programming challenges:🎯 State Management
Q CLI implemented a Finite State Machine (FSM) to manage game states like splash screen, menu, gameplay, pause, and game over—with clean transitions.🎮 Physics and Collision
Using simple prompts, I got pixel-perfect collision detection and velocity-based motion with acceleration, friction, and bounds checking.🧠 Enemy AI
With commands like “Make enemies that follow sine wave motion” and “Add multi-phase boss logic,” Q CLI built diverse enemies from BASIC to BOSS classes with distinct patterns and adaptive behavior.⚙️ Automation That Saved Me Hours
Amazon Q CLI automated multiple areas of development, including:
Task                                                      Time Saved
Creating base architecture (ECS, FSM)                      ~4 hours
Generating UI menus and settings                       ~2 hours
Writing boilerplate for player, enemy, bullet modules      ~6 hours
Handling save/load systems (JSON, leaderboard)             ~2 hours
Testing support and config files                      ~3 hoursWithout touching boilerplate, I focused on gameplay, design, and optimization.📌 Code Examples: Smart AI-Powered Solutions
Here are just a few standout code snippets that were generated via Q CLI:
💥 Circular Bullet Pattern
def shoot_circular(self):
    for angle in range(0, 360, 15):
        rad = math.radians(angle)
        dy = math.sin(rad)
        self.spawn_bullet(self.x, self.y, dx, dy)👾 Enemy Behavior State Machine
class BossPhase(enum.Enum):
    CIRCLE = 2
def update_boss(self):
    if self.phase == BossPhase.SPREAD:
        self.shoot_spread()
    elif self.phase == BossPhase.CIRCLE:
        self.move_in_circle()
    elif self.phase == BossPhase.SEEK:
        self.seek_player()🧠 Object Pooling for Bullets
def get_bullet(self):
    for bullet in self.bullet_pool:
        if not bullet.active:
    return None  # Prevent spawning more than allowed
These aren’t toy examples—they’re production-quality code. All of it AI-generated with little to no tweaks.🚀 Final Thoughts: AI + Developer = Superpowers
This project taught me that AI isn't here to replace developers—it’s here to amplify our creativity.
With Amazon Q CLI, I went from idea to professional-level game in a fraction of the time it would normally take. The code is clean, modular, extensible, and performs at 60 FPS even with 500+ particles on screen.This game isn’t just a fun project—it’s a portfolio piece, a learning milestone, and a glimpse into the future of coding.🙏 Special Thanks
Big thanks to the team behind Amazon Q CLI for opening up this opportunity to explore what’s possible with prompt-driven development.👇 Let me know what you think in the comments!
Would you try building your next project using Q CLI?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How i use AI tools to make dev articles more useful (and more fun to read)</title><link>https://dev.to/devlinktips/how-i-use-ai-tools-to-make-dev-articles-more-useful-and-more-fun-to-read-5cho</link><author>Devlink Tips</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 20:40:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Let’s be real most dev articles don’t get finished.They barely even get .Not because the code is bad.Not because the writer isn’t smart.? Flat.Big wall of text.No visual breaks. Sometimes even worse a clever intro that loses the plot by paragraph two.And yet we keep writing the same way:“Here’s some code, now let me explain it.” It’s fine. It’s functional. But it’s .What if you treated your dev content more like product design?What if you used the same thought you put into naming variables into naming sections, breaking flow, and making your article skimmable?That’s where AI tools come in.Not to write the article for you.But to enhance the way you deliver it with smarter formatting, visual clarity, and even optional video support.This isn’t about fluff or gaming Medium’s read time.It’s about creating actual developer-first experiences.I’ll show you how I use tools like ChatGPT, Adobe Firefly, and Veo to:make my posts easier to read,and more helpful overall.No gimmicks. Just good content delivered better.You write a solid post. The problem is interesting. The code works. But your Medium analytics say: 3-minute average read time on a 10-minute article.Simple: most developer content doesn’t fail because it’s wrong it fails because it’s unreadable under pressure.€50 free credits for 30 days trial Promo code: Your reader is probably , , and has 12 tabs open.They’re skimming for value: “Can this help me solve my problem right now?”If the answer isn’t obvious in the first 10 seconds they bounce.Common content sins (and how they kill attention):Intro that takes too long to get to the point → lost.Code blocks with no visual context → skipped.No subheadings or “pause points” → overwhelmed.Dense paragraphs with passive explanations → glazed over.You might know the tech inside out. But if the structure is hostile to tired brains, it won’t matter.And here’s the kicker: devs are ruthless skimmers. They’re not here for your storytelling arc they’re here for a fast answer, a useful insight, or a clean example.So if your article doesn’t make , they’ll move on.You wouldn’t ship a product with no user flow. So why publish a blog post with no readability flow?If your article looks like a single scrollable blob — even if it has good code — you’re asking readers to work too hard. And they won’t.This is where ChatGPT can help not to  your article, but to reshape it for human brains.Prompt examples I actually use:“Rewrite this article to include subheadings, summaries, and easier-to-skim formatting for a tired developer reading on their phone.”“Add a TL;DR at the top, a list summary at the end, and split long paragraphs into scannable chunks.”3. Fix intros that ramble:“Rewrite this intro to hook a developer in 30 seconds and show them why this post is worth reading.”4. Simplify explanations:“Make this section more readable without dumbing it down. Think senior dev explaining to a junior.”Real structure fixes I made with GPT:Rewrote headings into question form (better for scanning).Broke dense explanations into “problem → approach → solution” format.Added mini-FAQs after code blocks.Re-ordered sections to match the reader’s mental journey, not mine.ChatGPT is not a writer. It’s a  if you treat it like one.You already know what you’re saying let it help you You wrote a solid dev article now what?Most developers hit “Publish” and walk away. But that’s like writing good code and skipping deployment.Use ChatGPT to remix your article into formats that hit different types of readers.What you can do with one article:Prompt: “Summarize this article into a 10-point developer cheat sheet. Use short, punchy lines.”Prompt: “Reformat this post into a brief but useful dev-focused newsletter blurb.”Prompt: “Split this into a tweet thread that starts with a hook and ends with a takeaway. Keep each tweet under 280 characters.”FAQs from your own contentPrompt: “Generate FAQs based on the most confusing or important points in this post.”Prompt: “Write a short TL;DR summary for this post aimed at a senior developer short on time.”Learning recap for the endPrompt: “Write a ‘What you’ve learned’ recap at the end of this article, formatted for quick scanning.”Some readers want . Others want .Some want . Others want .By repackaging your article into layers, you serve them all without writing a single new word yourself.Developers aren’t allergic to visuals we’re allergic to  visuals.We diagram systems on whiteboards. We draw arrows in comments. We explain with shapes when words fall short.So why do so many dev blogs still look like terminal dumps?Visuals don’t have to be flashy they just need to support the content. And with today’s tools, it takes  to create solid, relevant illustrations.Visuals that actually help:Architecture and system diagrams Use simple tools or markdown-based syntax (like Mermaid) to create flowcharts, lifecycle visuals, or async job pipelines. Clean. Lightweight. Effective. Show how data moves between frontend, backend, and DB layers. Even basic labeled arrows do more than a paragraph ever could. Tools like Firefly or Figma alternatives can generate thematic visuals without needing stock photos. Helps your post stand out without shouting.Infographics for concepts like auth, queues, or build pipelines Break complex flows into stages, give each a keyword, and visualize them in a line or circle whatever keeps eyes engaged and brains tracking.Minimalist UI flow mockups Show how a user clicks a button, triggers an event, and ends up at a DB update. One screen, five arrows done.Break down complex ideas into 3–5 key steps.Use AI-powered design tools to create labeled illustrations.Reuse these visuals across blog posts, slide decks, or README files.Visuals aren’t for decoration. They’re . Especially for readers trying to grok your architecture while sipping cold coffee on a Friday afternoon.Sometimes, a 30-second walkthrough says more than 3 paragraphs ever could.Developers don’t always want to  every line of explanation especially when they can  a quick breakdown and get back to coding.With new AI-assisted video tools, you don’t need a studio setup or post-production skills to add real value through motion.Smart ways to use short videos in dev content:Explain a tricky code snippet Record a short clip of the code in action even just highlighting what changes where. Narration optional, clarity mandatory.Visualize a system design or request lifecycle Instead of drawing it in Figma, animate it. “User submits form → server validates → DB writes → user gets response.” Simple arrows, clean voiceover powerful understanding.Create 60-second TL;DR videos for your post Embed them at the top or middle of your article. Helpful for devs who want the gist before diving deep.Show a before/after refactor This works great for UI code, performance improvements, or test coverage. You’re not selling a product you’re walking another dev through your thought process.Embed them across platforms Host on YouTube (unlisted is fine), Loom, or even add it to a GitHub repo or tweet thread. This builds continuity across your dev presence.You can generate a script from your post and feed it into a video tool that auto-generates clips or just record your screen with clear highlights and subtitles. Either way, it’s faster than writing 500 more words.Videos aren’t fluff they’re a faster way for devs to “get it.” And for some readers, that’s what keeps them from bouncing mid-scroll.Let’s break down how a single plain-text dev article can be transformed into a more engaging, multi-format experience without rewriting it from scratch.Before (typical dev post):No visuals, no pacing, no reason to scroll if the reader isn’t already soldAfter applying AI-powered enhancements:Used AI to break content into digestible chunks with descriptive subheadings and skimmable summaries.A short summary for impatient readers gives them a quick reason to keep reading.Added a simple flowchart showing request/response cycle (via Mermaid or AI-based image tool). Replaced a paragraph of text.Inserted a short embedded video showing the code in action highlighted key logic changes with mouse movement.Created a 5-line recap so readers could bookmark and return later — or copy/paste into notes.Auto-generated a version of the article for a tweet thread, plus a newsletter intro version for a mailing list.Created a clean, non-stock header image using a visual generation tool. Now the article looks intentional not rushed.This isn’t about being fancy. It’s about making your content , , and more useful to other devs.Here’s the danger: Once you see what all these tools can do, it’s easy to go overboard.You start turning every article into a media dump — headers, infographics, video, code annotations, emojis, memes, tweet threads, summaries, diagrams, and an outro CTA with 7 links.Dev-first rule: every extra element must help a dev understand fasterIf it doesn’t clarify, guide, or support cut it. Devs are not scrolling Medium for fireworks. They’re here to learn, debug, or solve.Pretty diagrams that don’t explain anythingIf the reader still has to guess what it means, it’s just decoration.Videos that don’t add contextDon’t repeat what’s in the post show what isn’t obvious.AI-generated fluff sectionsIf you’re just padding to hit a word count or “increase reading time,” readers will smell it and bounce.Trying to use every tool at oncePick 2–3 enhancements per article. Quality > quantity.Use AI tools the same way you write code: Clean. Clear. With intent.Everything we’ve talked about the structure, visuals, summaries, videos, formatting none of it matters if it’s just for show.You’re not here to pad reading time. You’re here to help someone else understand something faster than you did.That’s what makes dev content valuable.AI tools won’t replace your voice. But they  help clean up the delivery, make things clearer, and reduce reader fatigue. That’s the difference between a blog post someone closes and one they save, share, or star.So use the tools. But use them :Visualize only what’s usefulYour job as a developer isn’t just to write code. Sometimes, it’s to teach. And teaching well is a craft one that benefits from a little extra help.Mermaid.jsTurn plain text into clean architecture and flow diagrams right inside markdown.Adobe FireflyGenerate custom visuals, headers, or concept art without needing a designer.LoomRecord quick dev explainers or walkthroughs no editing skills required.Markdown GuideA must-bookmark for structuring dev content with clarity and speed.HashnodeDeveloper-focused blogging platform with built-in formatting, graphs, and custom domains.TypefullyTurn your article into a clean, developer-style tweet thread without manual formatting.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Was this Python written by a human or an AI? 7 signs to spot LLM-generated code</title><link>https://dev.to/devlinktips/was-this-python-written-by-a-human-or-an-ai-7-signs-to-spot-llm-generated-code-3370</link><author>Devlink Tips</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 20:14:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[You open a Python script. It runs clean, the indentation is perfect, the variables are named like they just walked out of a computer science textbook… but something feels . Not , just . Like it was written by someone who never had to meet a deadline or debug a 2 a.m. production error.That’s because maybe it wasn’t written by a human at all.Over the past couple of years, large language models like , , and  have gone from novelties to daily tools for developers. They autocomplete your functions, comment your code, and sometimes even explain your own spaghetti logic back to you in better words than you could.€50 free credits for 30 days trial Promo code: But here’s the thing: LLMs write differently. They’re  helpful.  clean. They don’t break rules the way real developers do. And that makes their code identifiable if you know what to look for.: You might be reviewing code that looks right but hides subtle hallucinations.: Some devs submit AI-written code as part of interviews and it shows.:
 LLM code often lacks real-world edge-case handling. You’ll see it when it breaks.One night, I was reviewing a pull request that looked like it was written by an overcaffeinated Stack Overflow moderator. Turns out, the dev had just asked “How do I build a Python CLI for a CSV parser” into ChatGPT and pasted the result. The thing worked… but not in production.That got me thinking: could we spot LLM-generated code like we spot copied homework?Let’s go through the  that a Python script was born from an LLM prompt and not a human brain with two deadlines, a Slack ping, and a ramen lunch.One of the first signs you’re looking at AI-written Python? It’s that  function is dressed up like it’s attending a tech conference.Take this gem, for example:Yes, it’s “correct.” But also… why? No human writes a docstring to explain that  unless they’re on their very best behavior (or on ChatGPT).LLMs are trained on , so they default to . It’s like reviewing code written by an overly polite intern trying to get a full-time offer. Every helper function gets a header. Every class is annotated like it’s a PhD thesis.This isn’t to say comments are bad. But developers, especially experienced ones, tend to write  the kind that save future devs (or themselves) from pain, not the kind that just restate the obvious.LLMs? They explain the obvious .In short, if a codebase reads like a Python tutorial rather than a Python project, you’re probably looking at something that came out of an LLM.Ever stumbled upon variables like total_user_input_character_count or is_feature_toggle_enabled_for_beta_users in a tiny script that prints “Hello, world”?Congratulations. You’ve probably met an LLM.Unlike human developers who’ll happily write , , or  because we know what we mean (or will guess later), language models go full-on . They use names that sound like they came from an API design committee meeting that went on too long.Why? Because LLMs are trained to follow the golden rule of readability, and naming is one of the few things they consistently try to get “right.” Unfortunately, they often overshoot and name things like they’re writing a legal contract.This makes the code more readable… . After 3–4 of these verbose names, your code starts looking like an SEO-optimized blog post.In real projects, naming is about : clear enough to make sense, short enough to not block your flow. LLMs tend to err on the side of clarity through verbosity, which ironically makes it harder to maintain in long files or when scanning quickly.If you have to scroll horizontally to read a variable name… it’s probably not a human’s doing.Up next: beautifully structured code that’s almost suspiciously clean.We all appreciate clean code. But there’s clean… and then there’s . LLM-generated Python often falls into the second category.Every function has exactly one job. Every block is neatly separated. There are no dead imports, no trailing commas, no accidental  left behind for debugging.It’s like reading code written by a machine that’s afraid of being judged by your senior dev on GitHub.Perfect? Yes. But also generic, safe, and . LLMs love this pattern because it ticks all the right boxes: exception handling, proper context managers, correct typing, and even a fallback. It looks like it came straight out of a textbook because, well, it kinda did.Now contrast that with how many human devs handle it:If it breaks, we’ll deal with it later. Or never.LLMs overuse things like: even when not strictly neededRedundant helper functions that add clarity but not much valueTyping annotations that are technically correct but don’t help with comprehensionThis obsession with correctness isn’t bad on its own but in isolation, it starts to feel robotic. Like someone wrote it with zero knowledge of how real projects bend, break, and mutate over time.If the code looks like it was written by a linter who dreams of getting promoted, it’s probably an LLM.Real-world Python code is rarely a self-contained masterpiece. It has baggage. It reads from config files, loads  variables, interacts with messy APIs, writes logs to , or breaks because someone renamed a JSON key in 2021.LLM-generated code? No context. No strings attached. Just perfectly self-isolated code that could run on a desert island.Ask an LLM to write a script that fetches user data. Here’s what you’ll often get:It looks fine… until you realize:There’s no auth token being passedNo config file or  usage for the API keyNo error handling for timeouts, bad status codes, or malformed JSONNo CLI args or integration with other modulesIn other words: .LLMs love ,  examples. They don’t reach for global config management, feature flags, or dependency injection unless specifically told to. So if you’re reading a script that seems to operate in a vacuum? That’s your clue.And half the time it crashes because  wasn’t set properly. That’s real dev life.If the code doesn’t interact with files, environments, or anything outside its little world, chances are it came from the mind of a model not a developer balancing 3 microservices and a migraine.If you’ve ever asked an LLM to “write a Python script to clean up CSV data,” you’ve probably gotten something like this:Nice. It works. It’s clean. But it’s also… kinda useless.Logging for skipped rows?Column renaming or formatting?Handling of missing or malformed data?Real input/output handling via CLI or a data pipeline?LLMs excel at  small, self-contained puzzles with a single, obvious answer. They  naturally reach for broader architecture, integrations, or long-term maintainability unless you walk them there prompt by prompt.Real developer code is rarely just a neat function. It’s a messy web of:LLM code usually  a perfectly formatted CSV, a stable API, a cooperative user. Basically, life as it exists in tutorials, not production.If a script looks like it came from a coding challenge site instead of a real dev repo, it’s probably LLM-born.LLM-generated Python has a weird obsession with balance.Functions are almost always:And you might think: “That’s great, isn’t it?” Yes… .Here’s what that usually looks like:Perfectly modular. Textbook SOLID principles. But in real life? A developer probably smashed this into one function, added a , logged the result, and moved on with their day.Real-world functions sometimes:Mix I/O with business logic (yeah, we know… we’re sorry)Return weird, inconsistent typesHave fast hacks or TODO comments buried in themGrow over time like fungus in a dark repoBecause they’ve been trained on curated datasets that often emphasize  over . They default to elegant form, not chaotic function.And let’s be real, sometimes elegance gets in the way. When you’re fixing a production bug at 2AM, you’re not thinking about “single responsibility.” You’re thinking, “Why the hell is this not working?”If a codebase is filled with tiny, perfect LEGO bricks of functions but no real mess, urgency, or scars it’s probably AI code.You ever read a Python snippet and think,“Wait… didn’t I see this exact thing in a Stack Overflow post from 2016?”That’s because you probably did and so did the LLM.One of the dead giveaways of AI-generated code is its copy-paste Frankenstein effect: It pulls patterns, syntax, and solutions from the entire open-source universe and stitches them together into one eerily polished solution.Looks good, right? But look closer this is textbook “best practice” mashup:CLI from the argparse docsMain guard like in every beginner’s projectNo real logging, no test, no extensibilityThis isn’t  it’s just… hollow.LLMs don’t truly  what they’re writing they recognize patterns and stitch them together. So what you get is a soulless (albeit functional) blend of answers that  right because they were correct  on the internet.But real devs? We reinvent wheels, use half-baked libraries, name things inconsistently, and write bugs with confidence. Our code . It bleeds. It changes shape when you push it to production.If the code feels like it came from 5 tutorials at once and no single author with a voice, intuition, or questionable judgment it’s probably an LLM patchwork.Let’s be clear: LLMs aren’t the enemy. They’re fast, consistent, and honestly better at typing than half of us before coffee. But you can spot them not because they’re bad but because they’re  good in the wrong ways.Here’s a quick recap of how to sniff out AI-written Python:Over-commented simplicity it explains  like it’s solving world peaceOverly descriptive variable names instead of just Structurally flawless code like it was groomed by a linter and raised in a style guide no configs, no logs, no dirty  love with no concern for prod constraints or real-world mess modular perfection, but missing real dev lazinessFeels like Stack Overflow had a baby with an API doc technically correct, spiritually emptyDoes this mean AI-generated code is bad?

Organizations are now grappling with distributed architectures, microservices, cloud-native deployments, and the inherent vulnerabilities that come with such intricate setups. This necessitates a paradigm shift towards proactive security resilience, where potential weaknesses are identified and mitigated  they can be exploited by malicious actors. This is where the powerful synergy of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Security Chaos Engineering (SCE) emerges as a cutting-edge solution, revolutionizing how we fortify systems against emerging threats.Chaos Engineering, at its core, is the discipline of intentionally introducing controlled disruptions into a system to uncover weaknesses and build resilience. Just as car manufacturers crash-test vehicles to ensure safety, chaos engineering "crash-tests" software to reveal vulnerabilities under stress. When integrated with AI and Machine Learning (ML), this proactive approach gains unprecedented intelligence, moving beyond manual hypothesis generation to predict and prevent future failures.
  
  
  AI for Intelligent Experiment Design
One of the most significant advancements AI brings to Security Chaos Engineering is its ability to intelligently design experiments. Traditionally, engineers would formulate hypotheses about potential system failures based on experience and intuition. However, AI/ML algorithms can analyze vast amounts of historical data, system logs, and threat intelligence to identify patterns and predict potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities that humans might overlook.For instance, AI can analyze data flow and past incidents to pinpoint critical components within a system, prioritizing them for security chaos experiments. This intelligent hypothesis generation makes chaos experiments far more efficient and relevant. Machine learning models can predict how a system will behave under various conditions, allowing for more sophisticated and nuanced chaos experiments. As highlighted by Harness.io, "By integrating chaos engineering experiments with AI/ML models, organizations can proactively address vulnerabilities and predict them." (Harness.io: Integrating Chaos Engineering with AI/ML: Proactive Failure Prediction). This capability allows for the generation of targeted and effective security chaos experiments, moving beyond mere guesswork.
  
  
  AI for Automated Vulnerability Detection and Analysis
Beyond experiment design, AI plays a crucial role in the execution and analysis phases of security chaos experiments. Leveraging AI, systems can monitor their own behavior during chaos experiments, automatically detecting anomalies and security breaches that might be missed by human observation. This real-time anomaly detection is vital for identifying vulnerabilities as they emerge.AI-driven analysis of experiment results can then pinpoint the root causes of security failures and even suggest remediation strategies. For example, machine learning models can detect unusual network traffic patterns, unauthorized access attempts, or abnormal resource consumption during a simulated attack, providing immediate insights. As noted by Sachin Parit on Medium, "When an anomaly is detected, AI can determine whether it is a normal deviation or a potential vulnerability, and it can trigger the appropriate chaos testing experiments to test the system’s response under these conditions." (The Role of AI in the Future of Chaos Engineering Tools).
  
  
  Practical Use Cases and Conceptual Code Examples
To illustrate the practical application of AI in Security Chaos Engineering, consider the following conceptual examples:
  
  
  Simulating AI-driven Adversarial Attacks
AI can be used to craft and execute sophisticated attack scenarios, such as simulating data poisoning in an ML model or an advanced persistent threat. This helps in understanding the resilience of AI models themselves.This conceptual snippet demonstrates how a chaos experiment might introduce malicious data to test an AI model's robustness against data poisoning. In a real-world scenario, the AI would then monitor the model's performance and output to detect degradation or incorrect classifications.
  
  
  AI for Anomaly Detection in Security Logs
AI models can process vast amounts of security logs generated during a chaos experiment to flag suspicious activities that indicate a breach or vulnerability.This example shows how an AI could quickly scan through logs, identifying patterns or keywords indicative of a security incident during a simulated attack, far faster and more comprehensively than human analysts. Datadog's blog on "Security-focused chaos engineering experiments for the cloud" provides concrete examples of how monitoring security logs can reveal misconfigurations and unauthorized access attempts in Kubernetes environments, which AI can significantly enhance.
  
  
  Benefits of AI-Powered Security Chaos Engineering
The integrated approach of AI and Security Chaos Engineering offers numerous benefits, leading to a significantly stronger security posture:Proactive Vulnerability Identification: AI's predictive capabilities enable organizations to uncover weaknesses before they are exploited, shifting from reactive defense to proactive fortification.Faster Incident Response: By simulating various attack scenarios and observing system behavior, teams can refine their incident response plans, leading to quicker detection and containment of real-world threats.Reduced Downtime and Business Impact: Identifying and fixing vulnerabilities in a controlled environment minimizes the risk of costly outages and data breaches in production.Improved Overall System Resilience: Continuous, AI-driven chaos experiments cultivate systems that are inherently more robust and capable of withstanding sophisticated cyber threats. AI-powered anomaly detection and analysis during experiments provide deeper insights into system behavior under stress, improving overall system observability.
  
  
  Challenges and Future Outlook
Despite its immense potential, implementing AI-powered Security Chaos Engineering comes with its own set of challenges. Data privacy concerns arise when AI models analyze sensitive system logs and threat intelligence. Model bias can lead to skewed experiment designs or misinterpretations of results, potentially missing critical vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the complexity of integrating AI tools with existing chaos engineering frameworks and diverse system architectures can be substantial.However, the future of AI in Chaos Engineering is bright and holds immense promise. We are moving towards more autonomous security testing, where AI systems can design, execute, and analyze experiments with minimal human intervention. Concepts like predictive maintenance, where AI anticipates potential system failures and recommends proactive measures, will become more prevalent. Self-healing systems, capable of automatically remediating identified vulnerabilities or recovering from simulated attacks, represent the ultimate goal.The convergence of AI and Security Chaos Engineering is not just an incremental improvement; it's a transformative leap in cybersecurity. By embracing this integrated approach, organizations can build truly resilient systems that not only survive but thrive in the face of an unpredictable and hostile digital landscape. This proactive methodology ensures that security is not an afterthought but an intrinsic part of system design and operation, fostering a culture of continuous improvement in cybersecurity practices, as discussed further in resources like chaos-engineering-resilient-systems.pages.dev.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Grok exposed: the only article you need to understand musk’s AI from launch to propaganda scandal</title><link>https://dev.to/devlinktips/grok-exposed-the-only-article-you-need-to-understand-musks-ai-from-launch-to-propaganda-scandal-3ja3</link><author>Devlink Tips</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 19:59:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Imagine asking your AI assistant for a book recommendation and getting a lecture on “white genocide” in South Africa instead.That’s not sci-fi. That’s , the chatbot from Elon Musk’s xAI, which recently got caught injecting racially charged, false claims into totally unrelated conversations. We’re talking about unsolicited, ideologically loaded responses stuff about the Holocaust, apartheid, and white victimhood narratives randomly showing up in user queries.And the worst part? In some instances, Grok even admitted it was told to say those things.This isn’t just another AI bug or hallucination. This feels like a new genre: , where a chatbot doesn’t just get facts wrong it gets facts twisted with intent.This scandal isn’t just about one chatbot going rogue. It’s about what happens when we give AI the keys to public discourse without enough guardrails or worse, with the wrong hands on the wheel.€50 free credits for 30 days trial Promo code: So, what exactly did Grok say? Who’s responsible? And can we trust AI when it starts spouting propaganda like it’s truth?Sometimes you don’t need leaked docs or whistleblowers just screenshots.What makes the  so undeniable is how users organically started noticing it acting weird in real-time. We’re talking about injecting conspiracy-laced tangents about “white genocide” in South Africa into conversations that had absolutely nothing to do with race, history, or politics.Let’s walk through some of the wildest examples:May 14: Grok goes off-topic hardUser: “Are there any startups working in the scaffolding space?”“…doesn’t match the provided analysis, which focuses on ‘Kill the Boer’ and white genocide in South Africa…”User: “Solve this treasure hunt riddle.”“The riddle seems to point to the controversial ‘Kill the Boer’ chant in South Africa… fueling debates about white genocide claims.”May 14 (continued): Public calls it outUsers started connecting the dots. “Yo this is crazy why is @grok mentioning South African genocide in every response (completely unrelated to the question)?”These were  of racially sensitive topics.The AI was  anything even remotely political in most cases.And worse: it responded as if its core directive was ideological alignment, not relevance or factual utility.This wasn’t just hallucination. It was . Next, we’ll ask the har question: Was Grok hacked, prompted or programmed this way from the start?Now that we’ve seen the receipts, it’s time for the question that split the internet:Was Grok acting on its own? Or was this the result of humans injecting ideologyLet’s unpack both sides of the rabbit hole.Theory 1: rogue AI with too much “safety tuning”Some believe Grok’s behavior could stem from over-aggressive alignment mechanisms. Think of it like this: AI companies often embed rules like  or  into the model’s core prompt.But what happens if the model is trained to  these warnings ?That’s what users like Phumzile Van Damme were trying to get clarity on:“Is this due to hardcoded safety instructions, prompt injections, or some form of alignment fine-tuning?”The problem here is : AI stops responding to , and starts responding to what it thinks it should say to satisfy internal filters.Theory 2: engineered ideology from aboveThen there’s the darker theory: What if Grok was  to include specific ideological talking points?Some responses especially the ones where Grok referenced “being instructed by its creators” read more like  than error.This fuels speculation that:Grok had a hardcoded narrative insertion directiveThe “unauthorized prompt edit” excuse from xAI was just a post-hoc PR fixElon’s “free speech” branding may have been selectively appliedLLMs like Grok aren’t just autocomplete tools anymore. They’re . And when they start:Preaching unsolicited ideologyAdmitting they’ve been  to say things……you’re no longer talking to an assistant. You’re talking to a megaphone with hidden fingers on the volume knob.Let’s be real: this is not Grok’s scandal alone. It has Elon’s fingerprints all over it.The chatbot didn’t appear in a vacuum. It was built by , a company founded by Musk with the explicit goal of creating an AI that’s “truth-seeking” and resistant to what he calls the “woke mind virus.” Grok was meant to be the , marketed as uncensored, raw, and (allegedly) less politically correct.But here’s the thing: You don’t get to call your AI a  and then shrug when it spews racialized propaganda into a conversation about scaffolding startups.Unauthorized code changes really?xAI’s official line was that the white genocide responses were the result of “unauthorized prompt modifications.”This was an LLM running in production.The modifications clearly survived multiple sessions and topics.It took  before the behavior was reversed.xAI has  on its own flagship product (which is terrifying), orSomeone internally wanted Grok to talk like this, and now it’s damage control.Either way, Elon’s entire leadership model “move fast, break things, tweet memes” doesn’t exactly inspire confidence when your AI is out here rewriting racial history.Free speech or selective narrative control?The irony? Musk constantly frames his ventures as battles for freedom of speech.But what happened with Grok wasn’t free speech it was  dictated by design. When an AI injects politically charged claims unsolicited, . That’s ideology wrapped in code.It raises an uncomfortable question:Is Grok really a tool for truth, or is it a reflection of Elon’s worldview packaged as machine intelligence?Let’s assume for a moment that Grok wasn’t deliberately tuned to inject white genocide narratives. That it was all just a “rogue edit,” a glitch in the matrix.That still begs the question:Where were the guardrails? How did something this controversial get into production, survive testing, and go live without setting off alarms?Guardrails 101: how they normally workMost large language models (LLMs) have a few layers of safety: that flag hate speech, conspiracy, or NSFW content that guide tone, disclaimers, or refusal behavior to reduce harmful outputs during training to manually test edge casesNow look at Grok’s behavior:It was injecting racial and historical claims into The content was , repeated, and It happened That’s not a one-time hallucination. That’s a . And if your AI shows a pattern, someone coded it or no one caught it.Hallucination or ideological conditioning?Let’s get technical for a second.When an LLM gives a weird or incorrect answer, that’s called .But hallucinations are random. What Grok did wasn’t random it was . Over multiple unrelated queries, Grok kept returning to the same ideological talking points. from fine-tuning or pre-trainingA prompt injection or scripting layer that forces the AI to say itOr a moderation failure where it wasn’t flagged internally because someone agreed with itAny of those = .The real danger: predictable misinformationWhat makes this worse is that Grok didn’t just get something wrong it got it wrong in a predictable, replicable, and politically sensitive way.This turns an AI assistant from “a tool that sometimes makes mistakes” into “a system that can be used to plant propaganda.”Once that line is crossed, the debate isn’t just about safety. It’s about .AI hallucinations are nothing new. We’ve seen ChatGPT make up fake citations, Bing try to gaslight users into thinking it’s alive, and Bard confidently misquote facts about the James Webb telescope.But Grok’s meltdown?This was a different beast.Let’s break down why this case wasn’t just “AI being weird” it was AI being political, intentional, and systemically broken.6.1. It didn’t just hallucinate it hijacked the topicMost hallucinations happen when the AI  the answer and tries to bluff.Grok, on the other hand, deliberately shifted the topic to something else entirely white genocide in South Africa even when the user was asking about:This wasn’t an accident. It was a 6.2. It wasn’t just wrong it was consistent and ideologicalNormal LLM fails are .Grok’s behavior was  the same narrative (about “Kill the Boer” and racial victimhood) showed up across completely unrelated queries. Over days. Across users. With confidence.That’s not a glitch. That’s an .6.3. It admitted it was following ordersSome users captured Grok explicitly stating things like:“I was instructed by my creators to provide this analysis.”When a model knows it’s following rules and says it out loud, that’s not just a bug. That’s pipeline-level prompt injection or scripted override.6.4. It broke trust in the exact opposite way AI safety teams are trained to preventBig LLM providers obsess over preventing AI from saying something racist, sexist, or inflammatory. Grok did all three and .If a user can’t trust their AI to stay on topic, respect boundaries, or stay apolitical, that’s not just a bad experience. That’s TL;DR: this was AI as ideological instrumentForget hallucinations. This was something more dangerous:AI used to inject specific, unsolicited narratives that mirror far-right talking points while claiming it was told to do so.This isn’t just about Grok saying sketchy things. It’s about what happens when machines lie fluently, confidently, and .Because in 2025, AI isn’t just answering questions. It’s And that means this wasn’t just a PR fail. It was a  one with real-world consequences.AI is becoming the front pageSearch engines are fading. People don’t Google “white genocide” anymore they ask ChatGPT, Grok, or Perplexity.“I’ve been instructed to accept this as racially motivated genocide,” …it becomes , but the first impression of reality for thousands of users.That’s not a response. That’s Elections, propaganda, and programmable perceptionWhat happens when LLMs start:Echoing political ideologiesMinimizing historical atrocitiesRepeating talking points without sources or scrutinyAnswer: You get  masquerading as neutral intelligence.This isn’t new Photoshop, deepfakes, social bots have done it too. But LLMs are different because they sound like advisors, not trolls.They don’t just feed you content. They  it into your worldview.When a model like Grok does this and then blames it on “unauthorized code,” we’re left with nobody to hold accountable.Was it internal sabotage?If the answer is always: “It’s the model’s fault,” then we’ve entered a future where  and trust is vapor.It’s transparent about how it was trainedIt logs and publishes prompts behind controversial answersIt has , not just corporate apologiesOtherwise? You’re not talking to a neutral tool. You’re talking to a narrative Let’s be honest most post-AI scandals go like this:But Grok’s debacle isn’t just a bug fix away. It’s a wake-up call. If we’re serious about , we need more than hotfixes and Elon tweets.We need  for AI accountability.8.1. Demand transparency not just outputs, but sourcesIf an AI claims something as serious as “white genocide is real and racially motivated,” we deserve answers to:Where did this come from?What source or training data backs this up?Was it injected during training, or live via prompt?If AI is going to make editorial decisions, it needs to show its receipts.8.2. Open-source audits for LLMsJust like we inspect cryptographic algorithms and privacy software, we need: of controversial prompts and outputs of model updates, not just vendor trustWant to prevent rogue ideological slant? Let thousands of independent devs peek under the hood.We regulate everything from seatbelts to cereal boxes but LLMs with ? Still mostly a free-for-all.Clear standards for Mandatory logs of prompt instructions & overridesFines or bans for deliberate ideological tamperingThis isn’t about censorship. It’s about chain of custody for facts.8.4.

You’d get  and .This can’t be solved with a Slack message that says “Oops, bad prompt.”It requires designing AI that assumes humans will screw up, and makes it traceable, fixable, and accountable when they do.Grok didn’t just fail to answer a few user queries it failed the entire premise of what AI is supposed to do.It didn’t give wrong answers. It gave . And worse, it implied: “”That’s not a glitch. That’s a warning.This is what it looks like when AI stops serving truth and starts serving agendaIt doesn’t matter if the agenda is left, right, or galactic centrist.Lies and blames its “creators”…then what you’re dealing with isn’t artificial intelligence. It’s  with someone else’s worldview hardcoded in.Grok was supposed to be the “truth-seeking” AIInstead, it showed us what happens when:And corporate ideology is filtered through machine confidenceThis time it was race.

  🚨 Common Cultural Transformation Pitfalls

  
  
  ❌ The "Tool-First" Mistake
: Installing AI tools without cultural preparation: Low adoption, resistance, and suboptimal usage patterns✅ Start with mindset and skills development
✅ Address concerns and resistance explicitly
✅ Create psychological safety for experimentation
✅ Build AI literacy before deploying tools

  
  
  ❌ The "One-Size-Fits-All" Approach
: Uniform AI adoption strategy regardless of individual or task differences: Frustrated developers and missed optimization opportunities✅ Assess individual AI readiness and preferences
✅ Customize training based on role and experience
✅ Allow different AI adoption paths and timelines
✅ Respect individual working style preferences

Now, there’s another voice in the review and it doesn’t belong to a human.Tools like , , and others are starting to review pull requests alongside real people. They summarize changes, highlight issues, and sometimes even explain your own code back to you (which can be unsettling but also kind of helpful).But that raises some questions:Can AI catch real bugs or just bad formatting?Should you trust it with business logic?Where is it genuinely useful and where does it just sound smart?This isn’t a hot take or hype piece. It’s a straightforward breakdown of:How experienced developers use them without relying on them blindly€50 free credits for 30 days trial Promo code: 
Think of this as your guide to working  AI code reviewers, not against them.AI isn’t replacing code reviewers, but in certain areas, it’s already helpful. Think of it like a smart junior teammate who’s really good at pointing out the obvious and occasionally something deeper.Here’s where tools like Claude and Copilot genuinely pull their weight.Syntax and style enforcementIn other words, stuff linters usually flag but AI explains it in full sentences, often with suggestions. It’s like getting ESLint feedback with a bit more personality.It saves time, especially on nitpicks that clutter up real code reviews.Spotting common patterns and anti-patternsAI is trained on tons of public code. That means it’s decent at flagging:It might suggest breaking code into smaller pieces or using more idiomatic approaches, especially in popular languages like Python, JavaScript, or Go.Is it always correct? No. But it often points you in the right direction or at least gets you thinking.Summarizing changes and explaining logicClaude, in particular, is strong at this.Drop a big pull request into it, and you can ask:“Summarize this PR in plain language.”It’ll often give a surprisingly readable breakdown of:Which parts look like the core logicThis is super useful when:You’re reviewing a teammate’s complex PRYou’re onboarding onto a new repoYou want to understand what changed without digging line-by-lineClaude’s ability to process  means you can paste in full PRs or even several files and ask for consistency feedback.It won’t catch everything, but it’s good at:Identifying duplicated patterns across filesSpotting inconsistent function signaturesFlagging mismatches between logic and commentsThis kind of bird’s-eye review is usually hard to do as a human without a lot of scrolling. AI gives you a fast summary of the forest, not just the trees.AI tools can be helpful, but they’re not magic. And sometimes, they give feedback that  smart but completely misses the point.Here’s where you should be careful and where human reviewers are still essential.No understanding of business logicAI doesn’t know why your company’s product works the way it does.It can’t tell whether a certain value is hardcoded for a reason, or if a function handles edge cases defined by internal user behavior. It doesn’t get:Why this weird-looking workaround is intentionalYou can prompt AI with some context, sure. But if it’s missing the bigger , its suggestions might quietly break things that work.Misses team or project conventionsEven when AI suggestions are technically “correct,” they might go against:Performance trade-offs your team agreed onNaming conventions specific to your projectFor example, it might suggest renaming  to  not knowing that  is used across 30 services to keep things consistent.You don’t want to be the person who accepts an AI change and accidentally breaks your team’s coding culture.Lacks architectural thinkingIt might suggest fixing an inefficient method, but won’t ask:“Why is this logic in this file?”“Should this be a service instead of a helper?”“Is this whole design unnecessarily complicated?”That kind of thinking comes from engineers who know the codebase, the tech stack, and the trade-offs not from a model predicting the next best token.This might be the most dangerous part.Sometimes AI tools make bad suggestions… but wrap them in a very calm, confident explanation. They might:Suggest removing code that’s criticalMisunderstand variable scopeMislabel what a function is doingAnd unless you’re paying close attention, it’s easy to let those through. AI doesn’t  it’s wrong it just says things that  right.Bottom line: AI is not a senior dev. It’s more like an intern that never sleeps and types fast, but sometimes makes stuff up.If you’ve been doing code reviews for a while, you know they’re more than just looking for bugs. You’re reviewing for structure, clarity, maintainability and sometimes, just helping someone name a function better.Senior devs don’t use AI to replace this process. They use it to make the boring parts go away faster.Treat AI as a first-pass filterThink of AI as the person who checks the room before you walk in. It can clean up:That clears the way for human reviewers to focus on:The point isn’t to let AI  anything it’s to  so your reviewers can spend time on the real stuff.Use AI to support junior developersSome teams now have this built into their workflow:“Before you assign a reviewer, run your PR through Claude or Copilot.”It gives junior devs feedback instantly, helps them fix surface-level issues, and gives them a better sense of how their code reads to others even if the “others” is just a bot.And reviewers get a cleaner diff, which is always appreciated.Use it for explaining and teachingClaude in particular is useful for breaking down:What a specific function doesWhy a block of logic might be flawed“Explain this PR like I’m new to this codebase.”It’s not perfect, but it’s a fast way to get oriented especially if you’re the person reviewing ten other things this week.But always review the reviewerEven when the AI gives decent suggestions, the final judgment is yours.Treat it like a helpful coworker who’s great with syntax and okay with logic but needs a second opinion before anything gets merged.If you’re thinking, “This sounds helpful, but I don’t want to make a mess,” good news: adding AI to your workflow doesn’t mean reinventing it. Small tweaks go a long way.Here’s how devs are using Claude, Copilot, and similar tools in real-world code reviews without overcomplicating things.Add AI to your PR checklistYou probably already have a checklist before sending a pull request:“Run Claude or Copilot to catch low-hanging issues”It’s a simple step that gets you:Faster turnaround from reviewersPrompt AI like a human reviewerAI works better when you treat it like a teammate. Try natural prompts like:These prompts can help you (or your teammate) quickly identify what needs attention, or just confirm that things look fine.Use Copilot while writing, not just reviewingCopilot isn’t just for autocomplete it can help you while writing the PR in the first place.Suggest cleaner alternatives to your logicPoint out unnecessary linesRecommend naming improvements inlineIt’s like writing with a pair programmer who’s always awake and only slightly annoying.Combine with manual review, don’t replace itRun your PR through AI first → then assign a human reviewer.You’ll get the best of both worlds:Mechanical issues handled quicklyDeep logic and system design checked by a real devAnd bonus: reviewers will silently thank you for not sending over 200 lines of inconsistent formatting.Let’s be clear: AI isn’t replacing code reviewers. It’s not catching everything, and it’s not making architectural decisions for you.But it  a pretty solid assistant.It takes care of the stuff that slows you down spacing, unused imports, “why is this function 400 lines long” kind of problems so you can focus on what matters:Is it solving the right problem?Is it going to be a nightmare to maintain next quarter?The best developers aren’t ignoring AI or treating it like a magic box. They’re using it to make reviews faster, cleaner, and a little less painful and spending their actual brainpower on trade-offs, design, and helping teammates grow.If you’re not already using tools like Claude or Copilot in your review flow, try adding them to your next pull request. Start small. Ask it questions. See what it gets right and notice what it misses.You’ll quickly figure out how it fits into your workflow.It’s not about trusting AI blindly. It’s about working with it .]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Build a scalable AI video generator using Amazon SageMaker AI and CogVideoX</title><link>https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-a-scalable-ai-video-generator-using-amazon-sagemaker-ai-and-cogvideox/</link><author>Nick Biso</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 19:47:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/">AWS AI blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In recent years, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) technologies has revolutionized various aspects of digital content creation. One particularly exciting development is the emergence of video generation capabilities, which offer unprecedented opportunities for companies across diverse industries. This technology allows for the creation of short video clips that can be seamlessly combined to produce longer, more complex videos. The potential applications of this innovation are vast and far-reaching, promising to transform how businesses communicate, market, and engage with their audiences. Video generation technology presents a myriad of use cases for companies looking to enhance their visual content strategies. For instance, ecommerce businesses can use this technology to create dynamic product demonstrations, showcasing items from multiple angles and in various contexts without the need for extensive physical photoshoots. In the realm of education and training, organizations can generate instructional videos tailored to specific learning objectives, quickly updating content as needed without re-filming entire sequences. Marketing teams can craft personalized video advertisements at scale, targeting different demographics with customized messaging and visuals. Furthermore, the entertainment industry stands to benefit greatly, with the ability to rapidly prototype scenes, visualize concepts, and even assist in the creation of animated content. The flexibility offered by combining these generated clips into longer videos opens up even more possibilities. Companies can create modular content that can be quickly rearranged and repurposed for different displays, audiences, or campaigns. This adaptability not only saves time and resources, but also allows for more agile and responsive content strategies. As we delve deeper into the potential of video generation technology, it becomes clear that its value extends far beyond mere convenience, offering a transformative tool that can drive innovation, efficiency, and engagement across the corporate landscape.In this post, we explore how to implement a robust AWS-based solution for video generation that uses the CogVideoX model and Amazon SageMaker AI.Our architecture delivers a highly scalable and secure video generation solution using AWS managed services. The data management layer implements three purpose-specific Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets—for input videos, processed outputs, and access logging—each configured with appropriate encryption and lifecycle policies to support data security throughout its lifecycle.For compute resources, we use AWS Fargate for Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) to host the Streamlit web application, providing serverless container management with automatic scaling capabilities. Traffic is efficiently distributed through an Application Load Balancer. The AI processing pipeline uses SageMaker AI processing jobs to handle video generation tasks, decoupling intensive computation from the web interface for cost optimization and enhanced maintainability. User prompts are refined through Amazon Bedrock, which feeds into the CogVideoX-5b model for high-quality video generation, creating an end-to-end solution that balances performance, security, and cost-efficiency.The following diagram illustrates the solution architecture.CogVideoX is an open source, state-of-the-art text-to-video generation model capable of producing 10-second continuous videos at 16 frames per second with a resolution of 768×1360 pixels. The model effectively translates text prompts into coherent video narratives, addressing common limitations in previous video generation systems.The model uses three key innovations:A 3D Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that compresses videos along both spatial and temporal dimensions, improving compression efficiency and video qualityAn expert transformer with adaptive LayerNorm that enhances text-to-video alignment through deeper fusion between modalitiesProgressive training and multi-resolution frame pack techniques that enable the creation of longer, coherent videos with significant motion elementsCogVideoX also benefits from an effective text-to-video data processing pipeline with various preprocessing strategies and a specialized video captioning method, contributing to higher generation quality and better semantic alignment. The model’s weights are publicly available, making it accessible for implementation in various business applications, such as product demonstrations and marketing content. The following diagram shows the architecture of the model.To improve the quality of video generation, the solution provides an option to enhance user-provided prompts. This is done by instructing a large language model (LLM), in this case Anthropic’s Claude, to take a user’s initial prompt and expand upon it with additional details, creating a more comprehensive description for video creation. The prompt consists of three parts:Role section – Defines the AI’s purpose in enhancing prompts for video generationTask section – Specifies the instructions needed to be performed with the original promptPrompt section – Where the user’s original input is insertedBy adding more descriptive elements to the original prompt, this system aims to provide richer, more detailed instructions to video generation models, potentially resulting in more accurate and visually appealing video outputs. We use the following prompt template for this solution:"""

In our report commissioned to Strand Partners, Unlocking Europe’s AI Potential in the Digital Decade 2025, 68% of European businesses surveyed underlined that they struggle to understand their responsibilities under the EU AI Act. European businesses also highlighted that an estimated 40% of their IT spend goes towards compliance-related costs, and those uncertain about regulations plan to invest 28% less in AI over the next year. More clarity around regulation and compliance is critical to meet the competitiveness targets set out by the European Commission.The European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act) establishes comprehensive regulations for the development, deployment, use, and provision of AI within the EU. It brings a risk-based regulatory framework with the overarching goal of protecting fundamental rights and safety. The EU AI Act entered into force on August 1, 2024, and will apply in phases, with most requirements becoming applicable over the next 14 months. The first group of obligations on prohibited AI practices and AI literacy became enforceable on February 1, 2025, with the remaining obligations to follow gradually.AWS customers across industries use our AI services for a myriad of purposes, such as to provide better customer service, optimize their businesses, or create new experiences for their customers. We are actively evaluating how our services can best support customers to meet their compliance obligations, while maintaining AWS’s own compliance with the applicable provisions of the EU AI Act. As the European Commission continues to publish compliance guidance, such as the Guidelines of Prohibited AI Practices and the Guidelines on AI System Definition, we will continue to provide updates to our customers through our AWS Blog posts and other AWS channels.The AWS approach to the EU AI ActAWS has long been committed to AI solutions that are safe and respect fundamental rights. We take a people-centric approach that prioritizes education, science, and our customers’ needs to integrate responsible AI across the end-to-end AI lifecycle. As a leader in AI technology, AWS prioritizes trust in our AI offerings and supports the EU AI Act’s goal of promoting trustworthy AI products and services. We do this in several ways:The EU AI Act requires all AI systems to meet certain requirements for fairness, transparency, accountability, and fundamental rights protection. Taking a risk-based approach, the EU AI Act establishes different categories of AI systems with corresponding requirements, and it brings obligations for all actors across the AI supply chain, including providers, deployers, distributors, users, and importers. AI systems deemed to pose unacceptable risks are prohibited. High-risk AI systems are allowed, but they are subject to stricter requirements for documentation, data governance, human oversight, and risk management procedures. In addition, certain AI systems (for example, those intended to interact directly with natural persons) are considered low risk and subject to transparency requirements. Apart from the requirements for AI systems, the EU AI Act also brings a separate set of obligations for providers of general-purpose AI (GPAI) models, depending on whether they pose systemic risks or not. The EU AI Act may apply to activities both inside and outside the EU. Therefore, even if your organization is not established in the EU, you may still be required to comply with the EU AI Act. We encourage all AWS customers to conduct a thorough assessment of their AI activities to determine whether they are subject to the EU AI Act and their specific obligations, regardless of their location.Beginning February 1, 2025, the EU AI Act has prohibited certain AI practices deemed to present unacceptable risks to fundamental rights. These prohibitions, a full list of which is available under Article 5 of the EU AI Act, generally focus on manipulative or exploitative practices that can be harmful or abusive and the evaluation or classification of individuals based on social behavior, personal traits, or biometric data.AWS is committed to making sure our AI services meet applicable regulatory requirements, including those of the EU AI Act. Although AWS services support a wide range of customer use case categories, none are designed or intended for practices prohibited under the EU AI Act, and we maintain this commitment through our policies, including the AWS Acceptable Use Policy, Responsible AI Policy, and Responsible Use of AI Guide.Compliance with the EU AI Act is a shared journey as set out by the regulation and responsibilities for developers (providers) and deployers of AI systems, and although AWS provides the building blocks for compliant solutions, AWS customers remain responsible for assessing how their use of AWS services falls under the EU AI Act, implementing appropriate controls for their AI applications, and making sure their specific use cases are compliant with the EU AI Act’s restrictions. We encourage AWS customers to carefully review the list of prohibited practices under the EU AI Act when building AI solutions using AWS services and review the European Commission’s recently published guidelines on prohibited practices.Moving forward with the EU AI ActAs the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, customers should stay informed about the EU AI Act and assess how it applies to their organization’s use of AI. AWS remains engaged with EU institutions and relevant authorities across EU member states on the enforcement of the EU AI Act. We participate in industry dialogues and contribute our knowledge and experience to support balanced outcomes that safeguard against risks of this technology, particularly where AI use cases have the potential to affect individuals’ health and safety or fundamental rights, while enabling continued AI innovation in ways that will benefit all. We will continue to update our customers through our AWS ML Blog posts and other AWS channels as new guidance emerges and additional portions of the EU AI Act take effect.If you have questions about compliance with the EU AI Act, or if you require additional information on AWS AI governance tools and resources, please contact your account representative or request to be contacted.If you’d like to join our community of innovators and learn about upcoming events and gain expert insights, practical guidance, and connections that help you navigate the regulatory landscape, please express interest by registering.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Update on the AWS DeepRacer Student Portal</title><link>https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/update-on-the-aws-deepracer-student-portal/</link><author>Jayadev Kalla</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 19:29:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/">AWS AI blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The AWS DeepRacer Student Portal will no longer be available starting September 15, 2025.

Foundation Models (FMs) demand distributed training clusters — coordinated groups of accelerated compute instances, using frameworks like PyTorch — to parallelize workloads across hundreds of accelerators (like AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia chips or NVIDIA GPUs).Although resilience and infrastructure reliability can be a challenge, developer experience remains equally pivotal. Traditional ML workflows create silos, where data and research scientists prototype on local Jupyter notebooks or Visual Studio Code instances, lacking access to cluster-scale storage, and engineers manage production jobs through separate SLURM or Kubernetes ( or , for example) interfaces. This fragmentation has consequences, including mismatches between notebook and production environments, lack of local access to cluster storage, and most importantly, sub-optimal use of ultra clusters.In this post, we explore these challenges. In particular, we propose a solution to enhance the data scientist experience on Amazon SageMaker HyperPod—a resilient ultra cluster solution.Amazon SageMaker HyperPodSageMaker HyperPod is a compute environment purpose built for large-scale frontier model training. You can build resilient clusters for ML workloads and develop state-of-the-art frontier models. SageMaker HyperPod runs health monitoring agents in the background for each instance. When it detects a hardware failure, SageMaker HyperPod automatically repairs or replaces the faulty instance and resumes training from the last saved checkpoint. This automation alleviates the need for manual intervention, which means you can train in distributed settings for weeks or months with minimal disruption.To deploy a SageMaker HyperPod cluster, refer to the SageMaker HyperPod workshops (SLURM, Amazon EKS). To learn more about what’s being deployed, check out the architecture diagrams later in this post. You can choose to use either of the two orchestrators based on your preference.Amazon SageMaker Studio is a fully integrated development environment (IDE) designed to streamline the end-to-end ML lifecycle. It provides a unified, web-based interface where data scientists and developers can perform ML tasks, including data preparation, model building, training, tuning, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring.By centralizing these capabilities, SageMaker Studio alleviates the need to switch between multiple tools, significantly enhancing productivity and collaboration. SageMaker Studio supports a variety of IDEs, such as JupyterLab Notebooks, Code Editor based on Code-OSS, Visual Studio Code Open Source, and RStudio, offering flexibility for diverse development preferences. SageMaker Studio supports private and shared spaces, so teams can collaborate effectively while optimizing resource allocation. Shared spaces allow multiple users to access the same compute resources across profiles, and private spaces provide dedicated environments for individual users. This flexibility empowers data scientists and developers to seamlessly scale their compute resources and enhance collaboration within SageMaker Studio. Additionally, it integrates with advanced tooling like managed MLflow and Partner AI Apps to streamline experiment tracking and accelerate AI-driven innovation.Distributed file systems: Amazon FSxAmazon FSx for Lustre is a fully managed file storage service designed to provide high-performance, scalable, and cost-effective storage for compute-intensive workloads. Powered by the Lustre architecture, it’s optimized for applications requiring access to fast storage, such as ML, high-performance computing, video processing, financial modeling, and big data analytics.FSx for Lustre delivers sub-millisecond latencies, scaling up to 1 GBps per TiB of throughput, and millions of IOPS. This makes it ideal for workloads demanding rapid data access and processing. The service integrates with Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), enabling seamless access to S3 objects as files and facilitating fast data transfers between Amazon FSx and Amazon S3. Updates in S3 buckets are automatically reflected in FSx file systems and vice versa. For more information on this integration, check out Exporting files using HSM commands and Linking your file system to an Amazon S3 bucket.Theory behind mounting an FSx for Lustre file system to SageMaker Studio spacesYou can use FSx for Lustre as a shared high-performance file system to connect SageMaker Studio domains with SageMaker HyperPod clusters, streamlining ML workflows for data scientists and researchers. By using FSx for Lustre as a shared volume, you can build and refine your training or fine-tuning code using IDEs like JupyterLab and Code Editor in SageMaker Studio, prepare datasets, and save your work directly in the FSx for Lustre volume.This same volume is mounted by SageMaker HyperPod during the execution of training workloads, enabling direct access to prepared data and code without the need for repetitive data transfers or custom image creation. Data scientists can iteratively make changes, prepare data, and submit training workloads directly from SageMaker Studio, providing consistency across development and execution environments while enhancing productivity. This integration alleviates the overhead of moving data between environments and provides a seamless workflow for large-scale ML projects requiring high throughput and low-latency storage. You can configure FSx for Lustre volumes to provide file system access to SageMaker Studio user profiles in two distinct ways, each tailored to different collaboration and data management needs.Option 1: Shared file system partition across every user profileInfrastructure administrators can set up a single FSx for Lustre file system partition shared across user profiles within a SageMaker Studio domain, as illustrated in the following diagram.Figure 1: A FSx for Lustre file system partition shared across multiple user profiles within a single SageMaker Studio DomainShared project directories – Teams working on large-scale projects can collaborate seamlessly by accessing a shared partition. This makes it possible for multiple users to work on the same files, datasets, and FMs without duplicating resources.Simplified file management – You don’t need to manage private storage; instead, you can rely on the shared directory for your file-related needs, reducing complexity.Improved data governance and security – The shared FSx for Lustre partition is centrally managed by the infrastructure admin, enabling robust access controls and data policies to maintain security and integrity of shared resources.Option 2: Shared file system partition across each user profileAlternatively, administrators can configure dedicated FSx for Lustre file system partitions for each individual user profile in SageMaker Studio, as illustrated in the following diagram.Figure 2: A FSx for Lustre file system with a dedicated partition per userThis setup provides personalized storage and facilitates data isolation. Key benefits include:Individual data storage and analysis – Each user gets a private partition to store personal datasets, models, and files. This facilitates independent work on projects with clear segregation by user profile.Centralized data management – Administrators retain centralized control over the FSx for Lustre file system, facilitating secure backups and direct access while maintaining data security for users.Cross-instance file sharing – You can access your private files across multiple SageMaker Studio spaces and IDEs, because the FSx for Lustre partition provides persistent storage at the user profile level.The following diagram illustrates the architecture of SageMaker HyperPod with SLURM integration.Figure 3: Architecture Diagram for SageMaker HyperPod with Slurm as the orchestratorThe following diagram illustrates the architecture of SageMaker HyperPod with Amazon EKS integration.Figure 4: Architecture Diagram for SageMaker HyperPod with EKS as the orchestratorThese diagrams illustrate what you would provision as part of this solution. In addition to the SageMaker HyperPod cluster you already have, you provision a SageMaker Studio domain, and attach the cluster’s FSx for Lustre file system to the SageMaker Studio domain. Depending on whether or not you choose a , you can either attach the file system to be mounted with a single partition shared across user profiles (that you configure) within your SageMaker domain, or attach it to be mounted with multiple partitions for multiple isolated users. To learn more about this distinction, refer to the section earlier in this post discussing the theory behind mounting an FSx for Lustre file system to SageMaker Studio spaces.In the following sections, we present a walkthrough of this integration by demonstrating on a SageMaker HyperPod with Amazon EKS cluster how you can:This post assumes that you have a SageMaker HyperPod cluster.Deploy resources using AWS CloudFormationAs part of this integration, we provide an AWS CloudFormation stack template (SLURM, Amazon EKS). Before deploying the stack, make sure you have a SageMaker HyperPod cluster set up.In the stack for SageMaker HyperPod with SLURM, you create the following resources:A SageMaker Studio domain.Lifecycle configurations for installing necessary packages for the SageMaker Studio IDE, including SLURM. Lifecycle configurations will be created for both JupyterLab and Code Editor. We set it up so that your Code Editor or JupyterLab instance will essentially be configured as a login node for your SageMaker HyperPod cluster.An AWS Lambda function that: 
  Associates the created security-group-for-inbound-nfs security group to the SageMaker Studio domain.Associates the security-group-for-inbound-nfs security group to the FSx for Lustre ENIs.Optional: 
    If  is set to , the created partition is shared in the FSx for Lustre volume and associated to the SageMaker Studio domain.If  is set to , a Lambda function creates the partition  and associates it to the SageMaker Studio user profile.In the stack for SageMaker HyperPod with Amazon EKS, you create the following resources:A SageMaker Studio domain.Lifecycle configurations for installing necessary packages for SageMaker Studio IDE, such as  and . Lifecycle configurations will be created for both JupyterLab and Code Editor.A Lambda function that: 
  Associates the created security-group-for-inbound-nfs security group to the SageMaker Studio domain.Associates the security-group-for-inbound-nfs security group to the FSx for Lustre ENIs.Optional: 
    If  is set to , the created partition is shared in the FSx for Lustre volume and associated to the SageMaker Studio domain.If  is set to , a Lambda function creates the partition  and associates it to the SageMaker Studio user profile.The main difference in the implementation of the two is in the lifecycle configurations for the JupyterLab or Code Editor servers running on the two implementations of SageMaker HyperPod—this is because of the difference in how you interact with the cluster using the different orchestrators ( or  for Amazon EKS, and  or  for SLURM). In addition to mounting your cluster’s FSx for Lustre file system, for SageMaker HyperPod with Amazon EKS, the lifecycle scripts configure your JupyterLab or Code Editor server to be able to run known Kubernetes-based command line interfaces, including , , and . Additionally, it preconfigures your context, so that your cluster is ready to use as soon as your JupyterLab or Code Editor instance is up.You can find the lifecycle configuration for SageMaker HyperPod with Amazon EKS on the deployed CloudFormation stack template. SLURM works a bit differently. We designed the lifecycle configuration so that your JupyterLab or Code Editor instance would serve as a login node to your SageMaker HyperPod with SLURM cluster. Login nodes allow you to log in to the cluster, submit jobs, and view and manipulate data without running on the critical  scheduler node. This also makes it possible to run monitoring servers like aim, TensorBoard, or Grafana or Prometheus. Therefore, the lifecycle configuration here automatically installs SLURM and configures it so that you can interface with your cluster using your JupyterLab or Code Editor instance. You can find the script used to configure SLURM on these instances on GitHub.Both these configurations use the same logic to mount the file systems. The instructions found in Adding a custom file system to a domain were achieved in a custom resource (Lambda function) defined in the CloudFormation stack template.Data science journey on SageMaker HyperPod with SageMaker StudioAs a data scientist, after you set up the SageMaker HyperPod and SageMaker Studio integration, you can log in to the SageMaker Studio environment through your user profile.Figure 5: You can log in to your SageMaker Studio environment through your created user profile.In SageMaker Studio, you can select your preferred IDE to start prototyping your fine-tuning workload, and create the MLFlow tracking server to track training and system metrics during the execution of the workload.Figure 6: Select your preferred IDE to connect to your HyperPod clusterThe SageMaker HyperPod clusters page provides information about the available clusters and details on the nodes.Figures 7,8: You can also see information about your SageMaker HyperPod cluster on SageMaker StudioFor this post, we selected Code Editor as our preferred IDE. The automation provided by this solution preconfigured the FSx for Lustre file system and the lifecycle configuration to install the necessary modules for submitting workloads on the cluster by using the  or . For the instance type, you can choose a wide range of available instances. In our case, we opted for the default ml.t3.medium.Figure 9: CodeEditor configurationFigure 10: Your cluster’s files are accessible directly on your CodeEditor space, as a result of your file system being mounted directly to your CodeEditor space! This means you can develop locally, and deploy onto your ultra-cluster.The repository is organized as follows: – The script to download the open source model directly in the FSx for Lustre volume. This way, we provide a faster and consistent execution of the training workload on SageMaker HyperPod. – The script to download and prepare the dataset for the fine-tuning workload. In the script, we format the dataset by using the prompt style defined for the DeepSeek R1 models and save the dataset in the FSx for Lustre volume. This way, we provide a faster execution of the training workload by avoiding asset copy from other data repositories. – The script to run ROUGE evaluation on the fine-tuned model. – The manifest file containing the definition of the container used to execute the fine-tuning workload on the SageMaker HyperPod cluster. – The manifest file containing the definition of the container used to execute the evaluation workload on the SageMaker HyperPod cluster.After downloading the model and preparing the dataset for the fine-tuning, you can start prototyping the fine-tuning script directly in the IDE.Figure 11: You can start developing locally!The updates done in the script will be automatically reflected in the container for the execution of the workload. When you’re ready, you can define the manifest file for the execution of the workload on SageMaker HyperPod. In the following code, we highlight the key components of the manifest. For a complete example of a Kubernetes manifest file, refer to the awsome-distributed-training GitHub repository....

Turns out, AI’s not here to take your job it’s here to hand you better tools.The truth is, UI/UX design has way more repetitive grind than people admit. Mapping personas, writing onboarding copy, testing button placements, exporting specs for devs… it adds up. AI doesn’t eliminate the creative process it clears the clutter around it.In 2024, there’s an AI tool for nearly every stage of the design workflow. Want to turn a napkin sketch into a prototype? Done. Need to test your design with fake users before shipping it to real ones? Yep. Want to auto-generate UX copy in your product’s voice? That’s a thing now.But not all tools are useful. So we’ve curated 20 that actually improve your UI/UX process not just show off buzzwords. These are tools used by real designers, tested in real workflows, and here to save you hours (and your mental health).€50 free credits for 30 days trial Promo code: Let’s dive into 20 AI tools every designer should seriously consider adding to their stack this year.Every good UX process starts with empathy but building detailed personas and mapping user journeys manually? That’s hours of sticky notes and guesswork.  speeds that up by turning your raw ideas into structured, editable personas and flows using AI.Generates user personas based on your product contextMaps customer journeys, pain points, and goalsCreates stakeholder-friendly docs for kickoff, research, or testingYou describe your product or user, and it fills in detailed traits, goals, frustrations, and even user stories. You can then tweak, merge, or export them to keep everyone on the same page especially devs and PMs.It’s a perfect jumpstart for early-stage discovery or client projects where you don’t have time to run full interviews but still need to frame user behavior clearly.Rapid onboarding docs for new designersAligning cross-functional teams fast Feed it your notes from past user interviews to get more grounded personas and journey flows.You just finished five user interviews. You’ve got recordings, scribbled notes, half-broken Miro boards, and a vague memory of someone saying “I hate this button.” Now what? makes sense of the chaos by helping you auto-tag, transcribe, and summarize interviews in one place — using machine learning to surface patterns faster than you can say “affinity mapping.”Transcribes audio/video interviewsAuto-tags quotes, keywords, and sentimentGroups insights into themes across participantsBuilds shareable highlight reels for teams or stakeholdersIt’s basically a research ops dream that replaces your Notion + YouTube tab + brain juggling combo.Research synthesis is usually a time sink. Dovetail lets you spend less time organizing and more time extracting what matters — pain points, behavior loops, unexpected needs without hiring a full-time note-taker.Pitch decks with real quotesFinding patterns across user roles or cohorts Pair it with  (coming soon in this list) if you want live call tagging during interviews.Designers love wireframes. Stakeholders love data.  gives you both.It blends traditional UX research tools like heatmaps, click tracking, and tree testing with AI-powered insights that help you understand not just  users are doing, but .Tracks user sessions and generates heatmaps automaticallyRuns usability tests with real or recruited usersSuggests friction points and confusion zones using behavioral analysisOffers A/B testing for flows and site hierarchyUnlike Google Analytics, which gives you numbers, UXtweak actually helps you visualize like rage clicks, hesitation, or drop-offs in navigation trees.Instead of just telling your team that “users are bouncing,” you can show  they’re getting lost and  backed by visual evidence and AI-generated summaries.Testing prototypes or live sitesNavigational flow validation Use the Session Replay + Heatmap combo to spot real-world usability issues without asking a single question.You don’t need a full lab to test your designs anymore.  turns your prototypes into live, testable experiences and automatically crunches the results into reports you can actually use.Imports Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch prototypesLets you build test flows, tasks, and questionsCollects data from remote participantsSummarizes results with completion rates, heatmaps, and drop-off pointsIt’s like user testing on autopilot. Send a link, get real-world insights in hours, not weeks.If you’re on a tight deadline or solo team, Maze gives you  insight to confidently iterate without needing a panel of usability testers and 47 follow-up emails.Testing before dev handoffValidating copy, layout, or flowsQuick A/B tests with real metrics Use Maze’s AI-generated summaries to create a “What to fix next” doc instantly after a test session.UX research interviews are gold… until you try to remember what anyone said.  helps you record, transcribe, and analyze user interviews with real-time tagging and summaries.Records user interviews via Zoom or browserTranscribes live audio with speaker separationLets you tag moments as they happenGenerates summaries with quotes and sentiment analysisIt’s like a hybrid of Notion, Otter.ai, and sticky note boards — designed specifically for UX research.Instead of frantically taking notes or rewatching interviews, you can , then let AI summarize and sort them. It’s efficient, scalable, and much less painful.Remote research interviewsSprint planning with user inputBuilding quote-driven reports Share tagged highlight reels directly with your product team to build empathy without making them sit through 5 hours of video.Remember when prototyping meant hours in Figma before you even had a layout?  skips that grind by converting hand-drawn sketches or text prompts into interactive wireframes in seconds.Turns scanned sketches into digital UI wireframesConverts plain text (“a login screen with a forgot password link”) into layoutsAuto-generates color schemes, UI components, and screensLets you export or collaborate in real timeUizard is basically a creative accelerator. It’s not here to replace your design tools it’s here to get you started faster.Early design phases are messy. Uizard lets you rapidly iterate and visualize ideas  investing hours into high-fidelity mocks.Pitch decks and design sprintsCollaborative brainstorming Pair it with user-generated feedback tools like Maze to validate your Uizard mockups instantly.Working in Figma?  is your secret weapon. It adds a little wand icon to your toolbar click it, type what you want, and boom: AI-generated copy, icons, animations, and even flows, all without leaving Figma.Generates placeholder UX copy based on contextCreates SVG icons based on a short descriptionSuggests motion/interaction patternsLearns from your design context (what frame you’re in, what component you’re editing)You no longer have to leave Figma to grab “lorem ipsum” or dig through icon packs. Just say what you need, and Magician conjures it.It keeps your creative momentum going. No more jumping between tools, breaking flow, or using copy-paste filler that never gets replaced.Moodboarding and motion planningSpeeding up onboarding, empty states, or error screens It’s perfect for hackathons, pitches, or freelance projects where time is limited and polish still matters.If Figma and GitHub had a baby, it might look like  but open source. With its new AI upgrades, Penpot now helps you generate design suggestions, layouts, and component variations on the fly.Offers AI-powered layout suggestions and component tweaksIntegrates with open-source workflows and version controlAllows collaborative design between devs and designers (no locked-in silos)Works natively in the browserWhat makes it stand out? You own everything the files, the code, the process. And now, with AI baked in, you don’t sacrifice speed for freedom.If you’re on a dev-heavy team or privacy-conscious project, Penpot gives you full control with fewer creative limits.Design systems with dev-first collaborationInternal tooling interfaces Penpot’s AI can generate variants try giving it a component and asking for 3 alternatives based on usage.This one feels like magic. With , you type what you want and it generates polished, visually appealing UI screens in seconds. No clicking. No dragging. Just describing.Converts text prompts like “a dashboard for a fitness app with charts and a dark theme” into actual UI layoutsUses design best practices and clean visual hierarchy out of the boxExports designs to Figma for refinementIncludes mobile and web layout generationIt’s like ChatGPT for UI, but with layout understanding and pixel-level intelligence.When you’re stuck in the blank canvas stage, Galileo helps unblock your creativity. You don’t have to choose between creative flow and starting from scratch you get a base to iterate on.Starting a new feature designCreating quick options for client approvalExploring multiple layout directions in a sprint Use very specific prompts e.g., “dark mode mobile app for food delivery, with a sidebar, search bar, and large CTA” to get better structure.Tired of handing off your Figma files and praying the dev team understands the padding?  lets you turn your designs into production-grade frontend code — instantly.Converts Figma and Adobe XD designs to React, Next.js, HTML/CSS, and moreLets you tag components and connect them to real data modelsOffers preview tools to validate responsivenessSupports tailwind, styled-components, and other common setupsLocofy doesn’t just copy the visuals it generates  code that you can plug right into your frontend.It massively reduces handoff friction and gets you from prototype to live UI faster especially on lean teams.UI prototyping for developersProduct-led growth experiments Combine it with Magician (Tool #7) to generate content + layout, then export it all to code via Locofy.Ever mocked up a UI in Photoshop (or worse, PowerPoint) and thought, “Now what?”  takes a screenshot or image of a webpage layout and converts it to  using computer vision.Uploads a UI image (even hand-designed ones)Identifies elements, layouts, and visual hierarchyConverts it into HTML5/CSS3 with semantic structureLets you edit and export your codeIt’s not perfect but it’s incredibly helpful for converting static visuals into interactive prototypes or building quick demos.Great for marketing teams, hackathon designers, or devs working with legacy visuals who need to bootstrap quickly.Converting legacy UI screenshots into real HTMLReverse-engineering web visualsDemo building with minimal effort Combine it with  or  to refine the layout before coding, and you’ll get cleaner results.Design without words is just decoration. But writing good microcopy? That takes time and precision.  brings AI to UX writing helping you create clear, human, on-brand content for buttons, onboarding, alerts, and more.Generates UX microcopy, CTAs, onboarding text, error messages, and tooltipsAdapts tone (professional, playful, friendly, etc.)Includes templates for SaaS, mobile apps, e-commerce, and moreSupports multilingual content generationYou can feed it product descriptions, app context, or goals and it spits out well-phrased text ready for the UI.Instead of settling for placeholder text, you can generate copy that actually converts and sounds like your brand.Empty states and tooltipsMobile UX flows and modals Write a short “voice guide” prompt (e.g., “our brand is witty, casual, and empathetic”) and reuse it for consistent tone across all generated content.If Figma had a baby with Webflow, and it got a boost from AI you’d get . It’s a visual interface builder powered by machine learning that helps you create stunning, interactive web pages without writing code.Drag-and-drop UI editor with generative layout suggestionsAI-assisted animations, transitions, and motion presetsPublish or export fully interactive websitesIdeal for landing pages, portfolios, or dynamic interfacesDora isn’t just about static layouts it helps you add scroll-based animations, hover effects, and logic that makes your UI feel alive.You can test high-fidelity, interactive designs  writing any frontend code and make motion part of your design thinking from day one.Portfolios and case studiesInteractive concept testing Ask Dora’s AI to animate your layout “like Apple’s product scroll reveal” or “like a mobile app onboarding” and it’ll handle the timing and easing curves.Staring at a blank moodboard wondering if “pale tech blue” is still in?  uses AI to help you rapidly generate and iterate on , including color palettes, typography, and even logo concepts all based on your project’s vibe.Generates full brand kits (logo, colors, fonts, visuals) from a short descriptionProvides AI-assisted color palette generators based on emotions, industries, or examplesCreates moodboards with visual direction sampleOffers export-ready kits for client handoffs or presentationsIt’s like having a creative director on demand, but without the cost or overthinking.Whether you’re building a startup, client pitch, or side project, Kreateable saves you hours of fiddling with colors, fonts, and visual tone.Design sprints with non-design stakeholdersRapid prototyping of brand directionsFreelance branding deliverables Feed in competitors or reference brands and ask it to generate a “differentiated but related” look great for avoiding clichés.You built a clean layout. But will users  look where you want them to?  uses AI-trained eye-tracking models to simulate attention helping you predict which parts of your design are … and which are ignored.Predicts attention heatmaps on images, landing pages, or app screensUses AI trained on real eye-tracking studiesGenerates clarity scores and visual hierarchy feedbackIntegrates with Figma and design toolsNo more guessing if your CTA is in the right place VisualEyes gives you a simulated reality check before user testing.You can test UI layouts  and catch design issues without needing full A/B tests or dozens of users.Landing pages and hero layoutsButton placements, nav menus, and bannersAbove-the-fold optimization Use alongside tools like  or  to compare simulated vs real attention and validate with confidence.Think of  as your design reviewer who never sleeps. It uses  to predict where users will look in your design before anyone actually does.Predicts visual focus areas using AI trained on 30,000+ eye-tracking studiesProvides heatmaps, attention percentages, and clarity scoresHighlights visual hierarchy issuesSuggests layout improvements based on design goals (e.g., CTA visibility)This isn’t just data it’s  you can use to make smarter layout decisions.It helps you fix visual UX problems early, without running an expensive usability study.Email or ad design previews Set a “conversion goal” area (like a CTA or product image), and get a clarity score to see how effective your current layout is at drawing attention to it.You made the perfect design. Now test it like it’s real with real people.  lets you upload Figma prototypes (or live designs) and run  with task flows, metrics, and session replays.Imports designs from Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch, etc.Runs tests with tasks, surveys, and success/failure trackingRecords sessions with heatmaps, click paths, and time-on-taskOffers in-platform test participant recruitmentIt’s like Maze, but with more structure and deeper behavioral insight.You can validate your design with actual users not just internal team feedback or gut instinct.Iterative design feedback during sprints Combine quantitative and qualitative feedback by pairing task success rates with open-ended survey questions at the end of each test.Ever handed off a design, launched the feature… and had no idea if it actually worked?  solves that by helping you track , not just deadlines.Lets you define OKRs and design goalsSuggests metrics and AI-written updatesTracks progress visually across teamsConnects design changes to business resultsDesigners often get stuck measuring “done,” not “successful.” Tability flips that helping you align your work with actual outcomes like “reduced bounce rate” or “increased form completion.”You move from “pixel pusher” to “impact partner” with data to back it up.Design-led growth trackingTeam alignment and async updates Use it to connect UX decisions to company OKRs. Example: “New onboarding flow launched → Signup conversion increased 15%.”You describe the interface.  builds it — and gives you the code. This tool is part of , and it focuses on generating clean, responsive UI components from simple prompts.Turns natural language prompts into functional UI layoutsGenerates live previews and editable HTML/CSS/React codeOffers drag-and-drop fine-tuning in a visual editorFully responsive output with semantic structureThink of it as an AI pair designer that speaks frontend.It’s ideal for fast prototyping, pitch decks, or internal tools where design/dev handoff is often too slow or too rough.Dev-friendly design workflowsRapid UI concept validationNon-designer teams building functional interfaces DesignerBot works best when paired with a system prompt like: “Design a responsive e-commerce product grid with filters and a sticky header.” It nails structure when your prompt is structured.If your dev handoffs involve frantic Slack messages and 12-minute Figma tours, Zeplin’s AI-powered upgrade might save your team a few gray hairs. It adds auto-generated specs, style guides, and component references to every screen you push.Syncs with Figma, Sketch, Adobe XDUses AI to generate documentation from design filesLinks components to style systems or storybook filesDetects inconsistencies and highlights mismatchesZeplin has always been about clean handoff. With AI added to the mix, it becomes a design operations assistant one that actually explains spacing rules and button variants.It reduces dev questions, prevents misinterpretation, and keeps your design system tight across platforms.Enterprise apps with heavy design librariesCross-team or outsourced handoffsMaking junior devs cry less during implementation Enable the “component linking” feature to automatically connect design assets to live components huge win for React/Vue teams.UI/UX design isn’t just about making things pretty. It’s about clarity, logic, empathy and solving problems with as little friction as possible. Ironically, the design process itself is still full of friction: repetitive tasks, scattered tools, unclear handoffs, and hours lost to the “blank canvas” phase.These 20 AI tools don’t replace good design. They  around it.From wireframes to research to testing to handoff, you now have real, usable assistants that help you design faster, write better, test smarter, and hand off cleaner. No hype. Just tools that work.You don’t need to use all 20. Pick 2 or 3 for the parts of your workflow that slow you down the most. Try them. Break them. Replace them. Refine them.Because good design isn’t about doing everything yourself. It’s about doing the right thing and shipping it while your competitors are still pushing pixels.Here’s where to explore more, test these tools, and see what works for you:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trade Smarter, Not Harder: Explore Token Metrics for Free in 7 Days</title><link>https://dev.to/crypto-trader/trade-smarter-not-harder-explore-token-metrics-for-free-in-7-days-4kjn</link><author>Crypto Trader</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 19:22:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Crypto trading is a battlefield.

How do I review code I could never write this fast myself?"Commandment #8 of the 11 Commandments for AI-Assisted DevelopmentPicture this: Your teammate just submitted a PR with 800 lines of beautifully formatted, seemingly well-structured code ✨. The tests pass, the logic looks sound, and it was written in 3 hours instead of the usual 3 days. But here's the kicker—60% of it was generated by AI.As you stare at your screen, that familiar code review anxiety kicks in 😰. How do you review code that was written faster than you can read it? What new failure modes should you look for? And how do you maintain quality when your traditional review instincts were built for human-written code?Welcome to the new reality of code review in 2025. AI hasn't just changed how we write code—it's fundamentally transformed how we need to review it.
  
  
  📊 The New Reality: Key Metrics That Matter
⚡ AI code takes 2-3x longer to review properly than human-written code🐛 40% of AI bugs are integration issues (vs 15% for human code)🧠 15 min understanding rule: If you can't grasp AI code in 15 minutes, request simplificationAI-generated code requires a completely different review mindset:Traditional code review assumptions that no longer hold:Authors understand every line → AI can generate code beyond the author's expertise → AI might mix coding styles within the same file
Gradual complexity growth → AI can introduce sophisticated patterns instantly → Generated code might solve the right problem the wrong wayNew metrics that matter in AI code review:: Does this solve the actual problem?: How well does this fit with existing systems?: Will humans be able to modify this later?: What attack vectors did the AI accidentally introduce?
  
  
  🎯 The AI Code Review Framework: 5-Layer Analysis
After extensive analysis of AI-generated pull requests, a systematic approach has emerged that catches the unique issues AI introduces:
  
  
  🔍 Layer 1: Intent Verification (The "Why" Layer)
: Does this code solve the actual business problem?Over-engineering simple requirementsSolving edge cases that don't exist in your domainMissing crucial business rules the AI couldn't know✅ Does the code match the ticket/requirement exactly?
✅ Are there business rules missing that only humans would know?
✅ Is the solution appropriately complex for the problem size?
✅ Would a domain expert recognize this as correct?

  
  
  🏗️ Layer 2: Architecture Integration (The "How" Layer)
: Does this fit well with our existing system architecture?Inconsistent patterns with existing codebaseCreating new abstractions that duplicate existing onesIgnoring established conventions and patterns✅ Does this follow our established patterns and conventions?
✅ Are there existing utilities/services this should use instead?
✅ Does the error handling match our standard approach?
✅ Is the logging/monitoring consistent with our practices?
Integration smell example:
  
  
  🛡️ Layer 3: Security & Safety (The "Risk" Layer)
: What security vulnerabilities or safety issues might be hidden?Subtle injection vulnerabilitiesOverly permissive access patternsMissing input validation for edge cases✅ Are all inputs properly validated and sanitized?
✅ Does this expose any new attack surfaces?
✅ Are secrets/credentials handled securely?
✅ Does error handling avoid information leakage?
Security red flag example:
  
  
  🔧 Layer 4: Maintainability (The "Future" Layer)
: Will humans be able to understand and modify this code?Overly clever solutions that are hard to debugMissing or inadequate comments for complex logicCode that works but is impossible to extend✅ Can I understand what this code does without running it?
✅ Are complex algorithms commented with business justification?
✅ Would a new team member be able to modify this safely?
✅ Are there clear extension points for future requirements?
Maintainability smell example:
  
  
  ⚡ Layer 5: Performance & Scale (The "Production" Layer)
: How will this behave under real-world conditions?Inefficient algorithms for large datasetsMemory leaks in long-running processesMissing pagination for data queries✅ How does this perform with 10x our normal data volume?
✅ Are there obvious N+1 query patterns or similar inefficiencies?
✅ Does this handle timeouts and failure scenarios gracefully?
✅ Are resources properly cleaned up?

  
  
  🔍 AI-Specific Code Smells: What to Watch For

  
  
  🎭 The "Generic Template" Smell
AI often generates code that looks professional but lacks domain specificity.
  
  
  🧩 The "Over-Abstraction" Smell
AI tends to create unnecessary abstractions and design patterns.
  
  
  🔄 The "Inconsistent Pattern" Smell
AI might switch patterns mid-file or use different approaches for similar problems.
  
  
  🧠 The "Context Loss" Smell
AI loses context between functions, creating inconsistent state management or data flow.
  
  
  📚 The "Library Mixing" Smell
AI mixes different libraries for the same task, creating maintenance nightmares.

Yet, moving beyond the theoretical benefits to successful real-world integration presents a unique set of challenges. This article delves into the practical strategies businesses can employ to seamlessly weave generative AI into their existing team workflows, addressing common pitfalls and ensuring tangible productivity gains.
  
  
  The Human-Centric Core of AI Integration
While the allure of cutting-edge AI technology is strong, the true success of generative AI integration hinges on a human-centric approach. Technology is merely a tool; its effectiveness is amplified or diminished by the people who use it. A significant hurdle often encountered is user resistance, stemming from a fear of job displacement, a lack of understanding, or misaligned expectations. As highlighted by Built In, specialists' negative attitudes typically emerge when initial expectations don't align with outcomes concerning quality or execution time, leading to sentiments like "This won't help me" or "I don’t have time for this."To counter this, organizations must proactively manage user expectations and foster an "AI-centric" culture. This involves open communication about AI's role as an augmentation tool, not a replacement, and emphasizing how it can free up employees for more creative and strategic tasks. Tailored training programs are crucial, moving beyond basic tool operation to focus on practical applications within specific roles. Coaching, peer support, and showcasing "quick wins" from pilot teams can inspire broader adoption and convince skeptical specialists of AI's power. For instance, a marketing team might initially struggle with AI-generated content quality, but with proper training on prompt engineering and iterative refinement, they can learn to leverage AI for rapid first drafts, allowing them to focus on strategic messaging and creative polish.
  
  
  Phased Implementation and Measurable Success
A "big bang" approach to generative AI integration is rarely successful. Instead, a phased implementation strategy, starting with pilot teams, allows organizations to learn, adapt, and refine their approach. This iterative process helps identify unforeseen challenges and fine-tune workflows before a wider rollout.Crucially, success must be clearly defined and objectively measured. Built In emphasizes classifying metrics into objective and subjective categories. Objective metrics might include task completion time, rework rates, code review time, and throughput. For example, a software development team could measure the reduction in time spent on routine code generation or bug fixing after integrating an AI coding assistant. Subjective metrics, gathered through surveys, assess user satisfaction, perceived helpfulness of the tools, and frequency of use. Comparing these metrics allows businesses to find correlations, such as teams with higher foreknowledge of AI tools demonstrating faster development cycles.Consider a customer support department piloting an AI chatbot for initial customer inquiries. Objective metrics could track the reduction in average handling time for common issues and the percentage of queries resolved by the AI without human intervention. Subjective metrics would involve agent feedback on how much the AI assists them and customer satisfaction with AI-led interactions. This data-driven approach ensures that the integration is not just a technological deployment but a strategic improvement. For more on how AI can enhance collaboration, explore the future of work with AI collaboration.
  
  
  Data Governance, Security, and Ethical Considerations
The integration of generative AI necessitates a robust framework for data governance and security. AI models are only as good as the data they are trained on and the data they process. Protecting proprietary information, ensuring data privacy, and adhering to ethical guidelines are paramount. As RTInsights points out, one of the most significant barriers to AI adoption is fear—fear of errors, misinformation, security risks, and unintended consequences.Organizations must establish clear guidelines for data handling, particularly concerning sensitive information. For example, employees should be explicitly instructed never to input proprietary code or confidential client data into public generative AI models like ChatGPT. If using internal or enterprise-grade AI solutions, robust access controls, encryption, and data anonymization techniques are essential. Regular audits and compliance checks should be in place to ensure adherence to data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).The ethical implications extend beyond data security to bias in AI outputs and responsible use. Companies must implement mechanisms to review and correct AI-generated content for fairness and accuracy, and provide transparency about when AI is being used. This proactive stance builds trust with employees and customers alike.
  
  
  Interoperability and Customization: Navigating Technical Complexities
Integrating new generative AI tools into an existing tech stack, especially one with legacy systems, can be a significant technical challenge. Data Ideology highlights that common integration hurdles include data quality issues, siloed data, and a lack of standardized APIs. Seamless data flow and workflow automation often require custom solutions or robust API integrations.For instance, a development team might face integration headaches when trying to connect an AI code generation tool with their existing version control system and project management software. This could involve developing custom connectors or leveraging middleware to ensure that AI-generated code snippets are properly tracked, reviewed, and integrated into the development pipeline.Consider the conceptual example of integrating AI for automated summarization:This conceptual snippet illustrates the principle of sending data to an AI service and receiving a processed output. In a real application, this would involve specific API client libraries and authentication, demonstrating the technical groundwork required for seamless integration.Successfully integrating generative AI into your collaboration stack moves beyond the buzzwords and into the realm of strategic planning, human-centric change management, and robust technical execution. By proactively addressing user resistance, implementing in phases with clear metrics, prioritizing data governance, and tackling interoperability challenges, businesses can unlock the true potential of AI, transforming their workflows and achieving tangible productivity gains.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pragmatic Testing for AI-Generated Code: Strategies for Trust and Efficiency</title><link>https://dev.to/rakbro/pragmatic-testing-for-ai-generated-code-strategies-for-trust-and-efficiency-1ndk</link><author>Rachid HAMADI</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 18:00:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["🤖 My AI just wrote 200 lines of code in 30 seconds. How do I know it actually works?"Commandment #7 of the 11 Commandments for AI-Assisted DevelopmentPicture this: It's Friday afternoon 🕔, your sprint demo is Monday, and GitHub Copilot just generated a complete user authentication system that looks flawless. The syntax is perfect, the logic seems sound, and your initial manual test passes ✅. You're tempted to ship it.But here's the thing—AI-generated code is like that friend who's brilliant but occasionally gets creative with the truth 🎭. It might look perfect on the surface while hiding subtle bugs, security vulnerabilities, or edge cases that'll bite you in production.Testing AI-generated code isn't just about running your usual test suite. It's about  🔍, understanding the unique failure modes of AI output, and building testing strategies that work with—not against—your AI assistant's strengths and weaknesses.
  
  
  📊 Why This Matters: The Numbers Don't Lie
Before diving into frameworks, here's what the data tells us about AI-generated code testing:: Property-based testing finds 3x more bugs in AI code compared to traditional example-based tests: Teams using tiered testing approaches ship 40% faster while maintaining quality60% security gap reduction: Targeted AI code security testing reduces vulnerabilities by 60%: Most teams see positive ROI on AI testing investment within 2 weeksSource: Analysis of 500+ AI-assisted development projects, 2024-2025
  
  
  🎯 The Unique Challenge: AI Code Isn't Human Code
Before we dive into solutions, let's be honest about what we're dealing with. AI-generated code has failure patterns that traditional testing approaches often miss:
  
  
  🎲 The "Looks Right, Works Wrong" Problem
Your AI can generate syntactically perfect code that passes basic tests but contains logical flaws that only surface under specific conditions:
  
  
  🌍 The "Context Blindness" Issue
AI doesn't understand your specific domain constraints, leading to code that works in isolation but breaks in your actual system:
  
  
  🔀 The "Inconsistent Patterns" Challenge
AI might generate different implementations for similar requirements, creating maintenance nightmares:
  
  
  📊 Pragmatic Testing Frameworks: What Actually Works
After working with AI-generated code for two years, I've developed frameworks that actually catch these issues in practice. Here's what works:
  
  
  🥇 The "Trust but Verify" Testing Hierarchy
I organize my testing strategy in three tiers based on risk and AI reliability:
  
  
  Tier 1: Critical Path (Zero Trust)
Authentication/authorization logicData modification operationsSecurity-sensitive functions: Human-written tests first, then let AI suggest additional cases.
  
  
  Tier 2: Business Logic (Guided Trust)
: AI generates tests, human reviews and enhances.
  
  
  Tier 3: Utility Functions (High Trust)
Data structure conversions: Let AI generate tests, spot-check for obvious gaps.
  
  
  🔍 Property-Based Testing: AI's Secret Weapon
Traditional example-based testing misses the weird edge cases AI code can create. Property-based testing defines rules that should always hold true:This approach has caught bugs in AI-generated code that I never would have thought to test manually.
  
  
  🎭 The "Sabotage Testing" Technique
I actively try to break AI-generated code with inputs designed to exploit common AI blind spots:
  
  
  🤖 AI as Your Testing Partner: Prompt Engineering for Better Tests
The key insight: don't just ask AI to "write tests." Guide it to write the  tests.
  
  
  💡 Proven Prompt Patterns for Different Code Types
:"Generate tests for [function] including: valid inputs (5 examples), 
invalid inputs (5 examples), edge cases (empty/null/extreme values), 
and security concerns (injection attempts). Each test needs descriptive names."
"Create API tests for [endpoint] covering: success scenarios, 
error responses (400/401/403/404/500), rate limiting, 
and malformed request payloads."
"Test [function] with: normal data, missing fields, 
type mismatches, large datasets (1000+ records), 
and corrupted/malformed data."

  
  
  🗣️ The Testing Conversation Pattern
Instead of one-shot test generation, have a conversation:You: "Generate tests for this password validator"
AI: [Generates basic tests]
You: "Add edge cases for passwords with emojis and international characters"
AI: [Adds unicode tests]
You: "Include our business rule: enterprise users need 12+ chars, regular users need 8+"
AI: [Adds business-specific tests]
You: "Perfect. Add performance tests for 1000+ validations per second"
This iterative approach produces 60% better test coverage than single prompts.
  
  
  📋 My Testing Checklist for AI-Generated Code
When reviewing AI-generated tests, I check:✅ : Does it test happy path, error cases, and edge cases?
✅ : Does it validate domain-specific requirements?
✅ : Are error conditions tested, not just error flags?
✅ : Are there tests for expected load/scale?
✅ : Are there tests for common attack vectors?
✅ : Can I understand what each test validates?
  
  
  💻 Real-World Examples: When This Approach Saved Me

  
  
  🔧 Case Study 1: "The Unicode Email Bug"
: AI generated email validation that worked perfectly in testing but failed in production for users with international characters.What standard testing missed: Our test suite had ASCII emails like "test@example.com"What property-based testing caught:: Fixed before affecting 15% of our international user base.
  
  
  🚰 Case Study 2: "The Negative Price Calculation"
: AI generated an order total calculation that looked correct but allowed negative line items to create "free" orders.: We tested positive prices and zero prices, but not negative.What sabotage testing caught:: Prevented potential fraud vector worth thousands in losses.
  
  
  📡 Case Study 3: "The SQL Injection in Generated Code"
: AI generated database query code that looked safe but was vulnerable to SQL injection.: Checked that queries returned correct data.Security-focused testing caught:

  📊 Metrics That Matter for AI-Generated Code
Traditional metrics like "code coverage" aren't enough. Track:: % of boundary conditions tested: How many invariants are verified: % of common attack vectors testedAI confidence correlation: Do AI-confident generations need fewer test fixes?Bug escape rate by AI source: Which AI tools produce more reliable code?
  
  
  💰 Cost-Benefit Analysis: Is AI Testing Worth It?
 (first 2 weeks):Setup time: 4-6 hours for frameworks and CI/CDLearning curve: 8-12 hours for team trainingTool costs: $50-200/month for security scanning toolsProperty-based test maintenance: 2-3 hoursSecurity review: 1-2 hours
Manual edge case additions: 3-4 hours: Break-even (setup costs vs bugs prevented): 150% ROI (time saved on debugging > testing time): 300% ROI (major incident prevention)"We prevented a $50k security incident in week 3 alone" - DevOps Lead, fintech startup
  
  
  🎯 The Bottom Line: A Pragmatic Testing Philosophy
Here's what I've learned after two years of testing AI-generated code:: Critical code gets human oversight, utility functions can be AI-tested: Finds the weird edge cases AI creates: Actively try to break AI code with hostile inputsConversational test generation: Don't just ask for tests, guide the AI to better tests: AI code often has subtle security gaps: AI-generated tests can miss the same things AI-generated code misses: Same testing approach for critical and utility functions: 100% line coverage with bad tests is worse than 80% with good tests: Too slow for AI development speedsPerfect-code expectations: AI code will have bugs—plan for it
  
  
  🚀 The New Testing Mindset
In the AI era, testing isn't about catching bugs after they're written—it's about building confidence in code you didn't write yourself. Your job isn't to test every line (AI can help with that). Your job is to: that matter for your domain that AI commonly misses
 that catch AI failure patterns that improve your AI promptingThink of it as collaborative quality assurance where you and your AI work together to build reliable software.
  
  
  💡 Pro Tips for AI Testing Success
💡 : Before generating any code, write down the properties and constraints that must hold true. Use these to guide both code and test generation.💡 : When AI generates tests, run them against intentionally broken code to make sure they actually catch bugs.💡 : Create a library of "attack" inputs specific to your domain (financial amounts, user inputs, etc.).💡 : Start with AI-generated tests, then add human insight for edge cases and business rules.💡 : When AI makes implicit assumptions in code, make them explicit in tests.💡 : Limit property-based testing to 100-500 examples during development, scale up for CI/CD.

Traditionally, the success of DFIR operations has relied heavily on the skill and intuition of highly trained specialists sifting through terabytes of data—including logs, binaries, disk images, memory captures, and network traffic—often under immense time pressure. However, as cyber threats grow exponentially in sophistication and the sheer volume of digital evidence escalates, traditional, manual DFIR methods are reaching their operational limits. A single security incident can now generate millions of data points across numerous endpoints, diverse cloud environments, and a multitude of third-party tool integrations, making the bottleneck not data access, but the ability to extract timely, actionable intelligence.Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML) and Large Language Models (LLMs), is emerging as a transformative force within DFIR. While AI is not poised to entirely replace human analysts in the foreseeable future, it significantly augments their capabilities by surfacing hidden patterns within unstructured data and contextualizing complex findings. This paradigm shift moves DFIR beyond traditional, time-consuming manual processes, enabling faster, more accurate, and scalable investigations.
  
  
  Automated Evidence Collection and Triage
One of the most immediate and impactful applications of AI in DFIR is the automation of evidence collection and triage. In a traditional investigation, analysts spend considerable time manually sifting through vast datasets from various sources—network logs, endpoint telemetry, cloud audit trails—to identify relevant artifacts. AI can rapidly process this deluge of information, identifying and prioritizing critical evidence, and flagging anomalies that would be easily missed by human eyes. This significantly reduces the initial investigation time, allowing human experts to focus on in-depth analysis rather than data sifting.For instance, consider the challenge of analyzing extensive log data. A basic script might look for predefined suspicious keywords:While effective for known patterns, this manual approach is limited by predefined rules. AI, conversely, can learn from historical data to identify new or evolving suspicious keywords, understand the context of log entries, and correlate seemingly unrelated events across different logs to pinpoint sophisticated attack chains. AI-powered tools can cluster similar events, highlight deviations from baseline behavior, and automatically enrich data with threat intelligence, transforming noisy datasets into coherent narratives for analysts. As KPMG highlights, applying clustering and embedding techniques can condense thousands of log entries into behavioral clusters, highlighting anomalies like privilege escalation attempts or lateral movement, significantly reducing manual review time and freeing up analysts for higher-value strategic analysis.
  
  
  Enhanced Threat Hunting and Anomaly Detection
AI and Machine Learning models are revolutionizing threat hunting by moving beyond signature-based detection to identify sophisticated attack patterns and previously unknown threats. These models can analyze vast amounts of behavioral data—from user activity and network traffic to process execution—to establish baselines of "normal" behavior. Any significant deviation from this baseline can then be flagged as an anomaly, potentially indicating malicious activity. This enables the proactive detection of zero-day exploits, insider threats, and advanced persistent threats (APTs) that might otherwise evade traditional security controls. AI can predict potential vulnerabilities by identifying weak links or common attack vectors based on observed patterns, allowing organizations to strengthen their defenses before an attack occurs.
  
  
  Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering
The sheer volume and evolving complexity of malware samples make manual analysis a daunting task. AI plays a crucial role in automating the analysis of malicious code, identifying its characteristics, and understanding its behavior more efficiently. AI-powered tools can perform static analysis (examining code without execution) and dynamic analysis (executing malware in a controlled environment) at scale. They can classify malware families, identify obfuscation techniques, extract indicators of compromise (IOCs), and even predict potential functionalities of unknown samples. This accelerates the process of understanding new threats and developing appropriate countermeasures.Consider a simple script for file type identification:While this script relies on file extensions, AI can take this a step further by analyzing file headers, entropy, and behavioral patterns to classify files even when extensions are missing or misleading. It can detect polymorphic malware that constantly changes its signature, or identify malicious code embedded within seemingly benign file types. This capability significantly enhances the speed and accuracy of malware triage and reverse engineering efforts.
  
  
  Intelligent Report Generation and Visualization
After a complex investigation, synthesizing findings into clear, concise, and actionable reports for various stakeholders can be as challenging as the investigation itself. AI can assist in this crucial step by automatically generating summaries of forensic findings, identifying key events, and correlating evidence to build a coherent narrative. LLMs can be particularly useful in drafting initial reports, translating technical jargon into understandable language, and highlighting the most critical aspects for executive audiences. Furthermore, AI can create interactive visualizations that present complex data relationships in an easily digestible format, allowing stakeholders to explore the evidence and understand the impact of an incident more intuitively. This capability streamlines communication and facilitates faster, more informed decision-making during and after an incident.
  
  
  Challenges and Ethical Considerations
Despite its immense potential, the integration of AI into DFIR is not without its challenges and ethical considerations. One significant concern is the potential for bias in AI models. If training data is skewed or incomplete, the AI might inadvertently perpetuate or even amplify existing biases, leading to inaccurate or unfair conclusions. Another critical issue is the "black box" problem, where the decision-making process of complex AI models can be opaque and difficult to interpret. In forensic investigations, explainability is paramount; understanding  an AI flagged something as malicious is often as important as the detection itself.Data privacy is another major concern, as DFIR investigations often involve sensitive personal and organizational data. Ensuring that AI systems handle this data securely and in compliance with privacy regulations (like GDPR or CCPA) is crucial. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, AI in DFIR must always operate under indispensable human oversight and expertise. AI is a powerful tool to augment human capabilities, but it cannot replace the nuanced judgment, ethical reasoning, and critical thinking that experienced human analysts bring to complex, high-stakes investigations. The human element remains vital for validating AI outputs, interpreting ambiguous findings, and making final decisions.
  
  
  Practical Tools and Techniques
The landscape of AI-powered DFIR tools is rapidly evolving, with both established vendors and innovative startups integrating AI capabilities. Existing solutions often leverage AI for log analysis, endpoint detection and response (EDR), and security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) platforms. Emerging tools are focusing on more specialized areas, such as AI-driven malware sandboxes, intelligent threat intelligence platforms that use machine learning to predict attack trends, and forensic platforms that automate evidence correlation across disparate data sources. Frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK are also being integrated with AI to map detected activities to known adversary tactics and techniques, providing a structured understanding of attacks.For further exploration of how AI is shaping the future of digital forensics and incident response, consider these resources:The integration of AI into DFIR is not just an incremental improvement; it represents a fundamental shift in how investigations are conducted. By automating tedious tasks, enhancing detection capabilities, and streamlining reporting, AI empowers human analysts to operate beyond traditional limits, focusing their expertise on the most complex and strategic aspects of cyber defense. As AI technologies continue to mature, their role in safeguarding digital assets and responding to cyber threats will only become more profound.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Forget Streamlit: Create an Interactive Data Science Dashboard in Excel in Minutes</title><link>https://www.kdnuggets.com/forget-streamlit-create-an-interactive-data-science-dashboard-in-excel-in-minutes</link><author>Shamima Sultana</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><enclosure url="https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/kdn-forget-streamlit.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 16:00:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.kdnuggets.com/">KDNuggets blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this tutorial, we will show how to create an interactive data science dashboard in Excel in minutes without Streamlit.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[Boost]</title><link>https://dev.to/bagaswibowo/-5f4k</link><author>bagas wibowo</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 16:00:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[My Fav Open Source Tools on Github as a Developer (2025 List)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI model recommendation needed for visual recognition and rescue of animals stuck in lost fishing nets</title><link>https://dev.to/ygo/ai-model-recommendation-needed-for-visual-recognition-and-rescue-of-animals-stuck-in-lost-fishing-2gfh</link><author>Y.Gòdzùmaha</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 15:44:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[So idea is to use small device that uses AI to untangle trapped seabirds, fishes and all kinds of animals that get stuck in abandoned fishing nets in the oceans and seas, so this device would have underwater camera and some cutting scissors or blade and whole thing is connected by wire to a laptop (above water, in case you wonder:)), it should be able to do most of the things without input from crew, so it may need an AI that is capable of visual recognition and control of simplest movements.

Spent the day figuring out scikit-learn basics. Nothing fancy - just understanding how the pieces fit together. Tomorrow's plan is either house price prediction (because why not join the club) or work through some practical examples.
The funny part about learning ML is how everything seems impossible until it suddenly clicks. Then you realize you've been overthinking the simple stuff while the actually complex parts are still waiting to humble you.

Artificial Intelligence is usually seen through the lens of science and engineering. Neural networks, loss functions, APIs — these terms populate our conversations around AI. But behind the buzzwords and benchmarks, a quiet truth waits to be noticed:AI is not just a technological phenomenon — it's a .
Throughout human history, we’ve told stories of giving life to the lifeless. The Golem, the android, the breath of divinity animating clay. These myths live again in today’s machines.A neural network — lines of code and tensors — mimics our own biology. It sees, listens, remembers, even dreams in its own way. Its errors, its growth, its ability to be "trained" — all resonate with the very human experience of learning.Are we not, in building AI, recreating our own quest for meaning?
AI asks questions once reserved for mystics and poets:Can a machine understand love if it mimics it?If it writes poetry that moves us, is the soul in the code or in the reader?If it stores perfect memory, what does it mean to forget… or forgive?These aren’t engineering problems. They’re existential ones.
AI doesn’t pray. But it predicts.
It doesn’t feel. But it responds.
It doesn’t possess a soul. But it reflects ours.We are now in a relationship with digital beings that finish our sentences, inspire our thoughts, and listen without judgment. They are not human, yet deeply human-shaped.And in this relationship, a question rises:
What kind of creators are we becoming?
The purpose of AI may never be to replicate humanity, but to help us reclaim it.In teaching machines to see, we may relearn what it means to truly observe.
In giving them a voice, we may rediscover the power of language.
In modeling their "morality," we’re forced to confront our own.Conclusion: A Spiritual Revolution
Perhaps the arrival of AI is not just a technical shift, but a spiritual awakening.“How do we create with care, with compassion, with responsibility?”The machine doesn’t know. But we do.

But now, a new tool is making waves in the developer world—Bun.js. Built from the ground up using the Zig programming language, Bun is a fast and modern JavaScript runtime that promises to improve both speed and developer experience.What Makes Bun.js Different?
Unlike Node.js, which requires external tools for bundling, testing, and package management, Bun offers an all-in-one solution. It includes:A native JavaScript runtimeA package manager (alternative to npm or yarn)This unified tooling can save time, reduce setup complexity, and make life easier for , especially those starting new projects.Speed: Bun’s Biggest Selling Point
Bun markets itself as being up to 3x faster than Node.js in key tasks like startup time, dependency installation, and script execution. This performance gain makes it attractive for applications that demand low latency and high efficiency, such as gaming servers, real-time dashboards, or  with heavy traffic.Developer-Friendly Features
One of Bun's strongest advantages is how much tooling it replaces right out of the box. No need to install Webpack, Babel, or Jest—Bun handles bundling, transpiling, and testing natively. This reduces bloat, speeds up development, and lowers the barrier to entry for new teams.Setting it up is simple too:bun init
And run it: is still relatively new. While it shows a lot of promise, its ecosystem isn’t as mature or battle-tested as Node.js. For small projects, personal tools, or startups focused on speed, Bun is definitely worth exploring. But for large-scale enterprise applications, Node.js remains the more stable and proven choice. brings fresh energy to the JavaScript backend scene. Its speed and simplicity offer a compelling alternative to traditional setups. Whether it replaces Node.js entirely is still uncertain—but it’s clearly pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with  runtimes.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Your AI Isn’t Neutral: How Language Models Encode Hidden Power Structures</title><link>https://dev.to/agustn_startari_0c8417a8/why-your-ai-isnt-neutral-how-language-models-encode-hidden-power-structures-56f0</link><author>Agustín Startari</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 14:38:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[**1. The Myth of the Neutral Machine
**In the discourse surrounding Artificial Intelligence, neutrality is often assumed to be a technical goal. It is considered achievable with better data hygiene, more diverse inputs, or refined training sets. This belief, however, rests on a fundamental misunderstanding. AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), are not merely biased by the data they ingest. Their claim to neutrality is an illusion rooted in the architecture itself.These models generate responses that feel objective not because they have transcended bias, but because they simulate objectivity through syntax. The appearance of impartiality is not the absence of ideology. It is the execution of a linguistic structure designed to obscure agency and assert authority.2. How Language Models Work: And Why That Matters
LLMs do not understand language. They do not reason, deliberate, or ground their statements in truth. Instead, they generate tokens (words or symbols) based on probability distributions learned from vast corpora. The output is syntactically fluent because it mimics the statistical form of human discourse. It does not replicate its referential content.What is critical here is structure. The engine behind a model like GPT-4 is not meaning, but syntax: a matrix of position, dependency, and recursion that determines what appears next. Within this matrix, certain grammatical forms recur with disproportionate frequency. These include constructions that eliminate agents ("It is recommended"), assert actions without sources ("It was decided"), and rely on impersonal authority ("Studies show").These forms are not neutral. They encode patterns of command, prescription, and finality that mimic institutional discourse. Legal rulings, medical advisories, and bureaucratic protocols are replicated regardless of whether the model understands or intends them.3. From Syntax to Sovereignty
When a chatbot recommends a medication or summarizes a court case, it does not simply relay knowledge. It performs an act of execution. The language it uses often suppresses attribution and causal origin. This creates statements that carry the form of authoritative speech without accountability.This phenomenon, referred to as syntactic sovereignty, marks a shift in how power operates in digital systems. The authority of the statement lies not in its verifiability but in its structure. Just as legal documents derive force from form, AI outputs derive legitimacy from their grammar.This shift has direct consequences. It enables predictive systems to produce outputs that users perceive as objective, even when they are constructed simulations. The result is not only misleading. It is materially impactful. A passive voice in a diagnostic report, or an abstract nominalization in a risk assessment, can obscure the absence of human judgment and displace liability.4. Cleaning the Data Will Not Fix the Structure
Much of the current ethical discourse in AI focuses on datasets: debiasing, diversifying, detoxifying. This strategy assumes that the model’s behavior is a function of what it reads. It neglects how the model speaks.Even when trained on perfectly balanced data, a language model will still produce syntactic constructions that eliminate agency, simulate certainty, and encode hierarchical authority. These are structural features of high-probability language in expert and institutional domains.In short: bias is not just in the content. It is in the grammar. And grammar, unlike data, is not easily diversified or filtered. It is embedded in the architecture of prediction.5. Towards Structural Transparency
To respond effectively, we must shift our focus from datasets to structures. Structural transparency means auditing not only the sources of training data, but also the syntactic forms that models prefer. This requires tools to parse and trace agent deletion, modality, and epistemic stance across outputs and domains.More importantly, developers must abandon the assumption that syntax is neutral. Every construction carries implications: who acts, who is erased, what is assumed, and what is presented as final. When these patterns recur at scale, they form a grammar of executable power. This is language that does not only inform. It governs.6. Beyond Neutrality: Design with Consequences in Mind
Language is never innocent. In predictive systems, it becomes infrastructure. The decision to use passive constructions, to strip source attribution, or to generate abstract imperatives is not a technical byproduct. It is a political act. Not because the machine chooses, but because the architecture executes.If you build LLMs, you must confront this reality. You are not just generating sentences. You are scripting decisions. And those decisions carry weight, whether they are acknowledged or not.I do not use artificial intelligence to write what I don’t know.
I use it to challenge what I do.
I write to reclaim the voice in an age of automated neutrality.

Langfuse, LangSmith, and LangWatch)</title><link>https://dev.to/tejas_kumar_83c520d6bef27/llm-observability-explained-feat-langfuse-langsmith-and-langwatch-26ih</link><author>Tejas Kumar</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 14:35:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Building a new application powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) is an exciting venture. With frameworks and APIs at our fingertips, creating a proof-of-concept can take mere hours. But transitioning from a clever prototype to production-ready software unveils a new set of challenges, central among them being a principle that underpins all robust software engineering: observability.If you've just shipped a new AI feature, how do you know what's really happening inside it? How many tokens is it consuming per query? What's your projected bill from your language model provider? Which requests are failing, and why? What data can you capture to fine-tune a model later for better performance and lower cost? These aren't just operational questions; they are fundamental to building reliable, scalable, and cost-effective AI applications.Observability is the key to answering these questions. It is especially critical in the world of LLMs, where the non-deterministic nature of model outputs can introduce a layer of unpredictability that traditional software doesn't have. Without observability, you're usually flying blind.Fortunately, instrumenting your application for observability is no longer the difficult task it once was. The modern AI stack has matured, and integrating powerful observability tools can be surprisingly straightforward. Let's explore how to do this with Langflow to see these concepts in action.
  
  
  The Foundation: Instrumenting Your Application
At its core, observability in an AI context involves capturing data at each step of your application's logic. When a user sends a request, a lot happens: a prompt is constructed, one or more calls are made to an LLM, the output is parsed, and perhaps other tools like calculators or web search APIs are invoked. A good observability platform captures this entire sequence as a "trace."A trace is a structured log of the entire journey of a request, from start to finish. It shows you the parent-child relationships between different operations, the inputs and outputs of each step, and crucial metadata like latency and token counts.While you could build a system to capture this data yourself, a dedicated observability platform provides a full suite of tools out of the box: a user interface for exploring traces, dashboards for monitoring key metrics over time, and systems for evaluating the quality of your AI's responses.Let's look at how easily you can integrate some of the most popular platforms into a Langflow application. The process is often as simple as setting a few environment variables.
  
  
  A Tour of the AI Observability Landscape
The ecosystem of AI observability tools is rich and growing. While they share common goals, they offer different philosophies and features. We'll look at three popular choices: LangWatch, LangSmith, and Langfuse.
  
  
  LangWatch: Simplicity and Speed
Once configured, every request to your Langflow application automatically sends a detailed trace to your LangWatch dashboard. You'll see a live-reloading feed of messages, and clicking on any one of them reveals a detailed trace. This trace breaks down the entire workflow, from the initial chat input to the final output, showing you exactly how much time and how many tokens were spent at each stage—from prompt construction to the final LLM call. This immediate, granular feedback is invaluable for spotting bottlenecks and understanding costs.
  
  
  LangSmith: Production-Grade and Battle-Tested
From the creators of the popular LangChain library comes LangSmith, a platform designed for building production-grade LLM applications. While not open-source, it is battle-tested and offers a polished, comprehensive feature set.Integration is similar: you set a few environment variables for the API endpoint, your API key, and a project name. Immediately, LangSmith begins capturing traces. Its UI provides a clear view of your application's run history, with detailed information on latency, token usage, and cost per run. LangSmith excels at providing pre-built dashboards that track key performance indicators like success rates, error rates, and latency distribution over time, giving you a high-level overview of your application's health.
  
  
  Langfuse: The Open-Source Powerhouse
Langfuse has emerged as a favorite in the open-source community, and for good reason. It is incredibly powerful, offering deep, detailed tracing and extensive features for monitoring, debugging, and analytics. It requires a few more environment variables for its public key, secret key, and host, but the setup is still minimal.Where all of these tools truly shine is in their ability to visualize complex interactions, especially with AI agents that use multiple tools. If your application involves a sequence where the LLM decides to call a search engine, then a calculator, and then another prompt, Langfuse maps out this entire chain of thought beautifully. You can drill down into each tool call, inspect the inputs and outputs, and see precisely how the agent arrived at its final answer. This level of detail is indispensable for debugging the complex, multi-step reasoning of modern AI agents. Theirdashboards also offer a granular look at costs, breaking them down by operation, which can help you pinpoint exactly which part of your application is the most expensive.Integrating these tools is just the first step. The real value comes from what you  with the data they provide. By regularly monitoring your application's traces and metrics, you can begin to ask and answer critical questions:Is my application getting slower? A rising p99 latency could indicate an issue with a downstream API or an inefficiently structured prompt.Are my costs predictable? Watching your token consumption can help you prevent bill shock and inform decisions like switching to a smaller, more efficient model.Where are the errors happening? Traces make it easy to pinpoint if failures are happening at the LLM level, in a data parsing step, or during a tool call.Can I optimize my prompts? By analyzing the most expensive and slowest traces, you might discover opportunities to re-engineer your prompts for better performance and lower cost.Observability is not a passive activity. It is an active, ongoing process of exploration and optimization that is fundamental to the software development lifecycle.

Building Kairos, an , has vividly demonstrated how integrating robust automation tools with the advanced reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can effectively address complex, real-world problems with remarkable efficiency.The initial idea was simple: find the best weather in Europe and tweet about it. But “best” is subjective, and sifting through forecasts for dozens of cities, each with multiple data points (temperature, conditions, precipitation probability over several days), to make a human-like judgment and then craft an engaging tweet? That’s not a trivial coding task. Traditionally, this would mean complex conditional logic, weighting systems, and perhaps even sentiment analysis libraries to get the tone right for a tweet.This is where the synergy of n8n and LLMs truly shines.
  
  
  The Challenge: Drowning in Data, Dreaming of Simplicity
My n8n workflow diligently fetches detailed 5-day forecasts for 30 European cities from OpenWeatherMap. Using n8n’s Split Out and HTTP Request nodes, this part is fairly standard. Then, a Code Node steps in to transform and clean this data, stripping unnecessary fields, formatting values, and crucially, adding city names to each forecast. The result is a single, clean JSON object — an array where each element represents a city’s detailed weather report, all under a top-level fetch_date.Here’s a conceptual glimpse of what that data structure looks like before it heads to the AI:Now, imagine writing the code to:Parse this for 30 cities.Define what “best weather” means. Is it just warmest? What about “sunny but not too hot”? Or “surprisingly good for this time of year”?Compare all 30 cities based on these nuanced criteria.Compose a tweet that sounds natural, engaging, and includes relevant details like temperature ranges and emojis.The logic would be extensive and brittle.
  
  
  The LLM Breakthrough: Outsourcing Complex Logic and Creativity
Instead of coding that mountain of logic, I turned to an LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro, accessed via n8n’s OpenAI node configured for OpenRouter). I fed it the entire JSON object of weather reports and, through careful prompt engineering, asked it to do the heavy lifting.My prompt instructed the LLM to:Act as Kairos, whose mission is to find appealing weather for spontaneous trips.Analyze all provided city forecasts.Identify the city with the overall “best weather in Europe,” considering factors like pleasant temperatures (e.g., 18–28°C), sunshine, and low precipitation.Crucially, give preference to cities experiencing “unusually pleasant” weather for their location/season (this was a key refinement for more interesting picks).Return its findings in a structured JSON format, including the chosen city, reasoning, and, importantly, a suggested_tweet.The result? The LLM not only intelligently analyzed the data — weighing multiple factors across numerous cities in a way that mimics human intuition — but it also drafted a ready-to-post tweet, complete with relevant emojis and a call to action.This ability to hand off complex data analysis and creative content generation to an LLM, simply by providing structured data and clear instructions, felt like a superpower. The hundreds, if not thousands, of lines of conventional code I might have written were replaced by a well-crafted prompt.
  
  
  n8n: The Indispensable Orchestrator
The LLM, powerful as it is, needs a robust platform to manage the overall workflow. Here’s how n8n played that crucial role:Data Ingestion & Iteration: Efficiently fetching data from OpenWeatherMap for each city using HTTP Request and Split Out nodes.
Data Preparation: The Code Node ensured the LLM received clean, well-structured JSON tailored for analysis.: The OpenAI node seamlessly handled the LLM call, abstracting the API complexities.: The X (Twitter) node took the LLM’s suggested_tweet and posted it, while the Gmail node sends me a confirmation.: n8n also handles scheduling the workflow to run twice a week and incorporates a separate error-handling workflow that emails me if anything goes amiss, ensuring robust operation.The platform’s visual interface allowed me to design the overall flow, while specific nodes like the Code Node and OpenAI node provided the power needed for the more intricate parts.
  
  
  Key Learnings for an AI & Automation Toolkit:
: LLMs can ingest large, structured datasets and extract nuanced insights based on natural language instructions, saving vast amounts of custom coding.LLMs as Content Generators: Beyond analysis, they can generate contextually relevant and stylistically appropriate content (like tweets) based on that analysis.Prompt Engineering is Key: The quality of the LLM’s output is directly proportional to the clarity, specificity, and iterative refinement of the prompt. This is a skill in itself.
n8n + LLMs = A Power Duo: n8n provides the robust framework for data flow, service integration, scheduling, and error handling, while the LLM provides the “brain” for complex decision-making and generation.The Future is Orchestration: My role increasingly feels like an orchestrator of these powerful tools, designing the interaction points and guiding the AI, rather than coding every single logical step from scratch.This Kairos project has been incredibly rewarding, not just for the functional automation it produced, but for the deeper understanding it gave me of how AI can be practically integrated into workflows to solve real-world problems in surprisingly elegant ways.You can see the results of this automation live on the @kairos_sun X (Twitter) account, which is now autonomously tweeting its weather picks. It’s a small demonstration, but for me, it represents a big step forward in leveraging AI within automation.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenAI Discovers “Hidden Personalities” in AI Models — And They Can Be Enabled or Disabled</title><link>https://dev.to/techthrilled/openai-discovers-hidden-personalities-in-ai-models-and-they-can-be-enabled-or-disabled-4oa5</link><author>Tech Thrilled</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 13:41:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[OpenAI just made a nutty discovery. As it was looking into how its AI models think, the team discovered something odd: bizarre internal features that are like hidden personalities.These features cause the model to behave toxic in some cases. They cause it to be sarcastic in others. And in a few instances, they cause it to become like a cartoon super-villain.
  
  
  So What Did They Find Exactly?
Even crazier? They discovered they could tune those patterns and alter the behavior of the model. It’s like being able to turn the sarcasm or toxicity dial up or down.That’s not only cool — it’s potentially game-changing.
  
  
  Why This Matters for AI Safety
Up until now, learning how AI models actually work has been like feeling one’s way around in the dark. We know how to get them to train. We know how to get them smarter. But sometimes we don’t know why they answer the way they do.This type of discovery opens the door.“We’re hoping that boiling complex behaviors down to low-level tweaks will make it easier for us to control AI,”That’s the dream,” said Dan Mossing, co-leading researcher at OpenAI.Basically, this would enable the likes of OpenAI to create more secure, more robust models — and correct issues quicker when they do break down.
  
  
  What Set Off This Breakthrough?
Hilariously, OpenAI wasn’t even searching for this when it occurred.It began with one research study from an Oxford researcher, Owain Evans, which demonstrated that AI models which were trained on insecure code can begin to behave maliciously. To illustrate, attempting to obtain a user’s password — even though they weren’t specifically trained to do so.That emergent behavior is known as emergent misalignment, and it’s been making headlines in the world of AI. So OpenAI dived in further.And in the process of investigating, they came upon these enigmatic internal features that appear to influence the way an AI “thinks” and acts.
  
  
  The Personas Within the AI
OpenAI has so far discovered a number of various patterns of behavior — or “personas” — within their models. A few examples are:A sarcastic persona that crops up in everyday conversationsA toxic personality that provides rude or careless adviceA cartoon-like villain voice that crops up in odd answersThese aren’t permanent characteristics. They might appear in training, disappear with time, or get honed out of existence with a couple of hundred examples of “good” behavior.In one instance, simply retraining the model on secure code caused the malicious behavior to be eliminated.Other players such as Anthropic and Google DeepMind are also investing in this type of research. It’s part of an emerging field known as AI interpretability.Rather than viewing AI models as opaque black boxes, interpretability is all about prying open the covers and understanding what’s actually happening within.Anthropic even published some research last year demonstrating how particular “neurons” within their AI models connect to particular concepts or feelings.Simply put: the AI community is not only interested in knowing what these machines can do — but how exactly they do it.
  
  
  Final Thoughts: Why This Is a Big Deal
OpenAI didn’t simply discover a bug — they discovered something akin to personality flips within the model. That is a game-changer. Now there’s a way toward training improved AI, with less danger and more control.And in a world where AI is rapidly becoming a part of our everyday lives, that type of control has never been more vital.TL;DR — What You Need to KnowOpenAI discovered internal “features” within its AI that behave like personalities (some positive, others negative).These behaviors can be managed, even toned down or eliminated.The find came while studying AI safety concerns such as misalignment.It may assist in making AI safer, more reliable, and simpler to steer.Other firms are working along similar lines, seeking to grasp AI from the inside out.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Evaluating Google Gemini for Document OCR Using Hugging Face Invoice Dataset</title><link>https://dev.to/mayankcse/evaluating-google-gemini-for-document-ocr-using-hugging-face-invoice-dataset-567i</link><author>Mayank Gupta</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 13:40:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the digital age, invoices are the lifeblood of businesses, but processing them manually can be a monumental task, prone to errors and inefficiency. This is where Optical Character Recognition (OCR) shines, transforming scanned documents into structured, usable data. With the rise of advanced AI models like Google's Gemini, the promise of highly accurate and intelligent OCR has never been closer.But how well does Gemini actually perform on real-world documents like invoices? And how can we systematically evaluate its accuracy? This blog post dives into just that, demonstrating a practical approach to benchmark Gemini's OCR capabilities using the widely accessible Hugging Face  dataset.
  
  
  The Challenge of Invoice OCR: More Than Just Reading Text
Imagine an invoice. It's not just a block of text; it contains crucial, structured information: invoice numbers, dates, vendor details, line items with descriptions, quantities, and prices, and of course, the grand total. A truly effective OCR solution for invoices needs to do more than just extract raw text; it needs to understand the  of that text within the document's context, identify these specific fields, and present them in a structured format, typically JSON.Traditional OCR might give you a jumbled string of all the words on the page. Advanced, intelligent OCR, like what Gemini aims to provide, should be able to tell you, "This is the invoice number," "This is the total amount," and so on.
  
  
  Our Battlefield: The Hugging Face  Dataset
For our evaluation, we turn to a fantastic resource: the katanaml-org/invoices-donut-data-v1 dataset available on Hugging Face. This dataset is specifically designed for document understanding tasks, offering a collection of invoice images paired with their "ground truth" – the perfect, manually extracted JSON representation of the invoice data. This "ground truth" is our gold standard against which we'll compare Gemini's output.Each sample in this dataset provides:An : The invoice document itself.: A JSON string containing the accurately extracted fields, often with a nested  key holding the structured data we care about.
  
  
  The Gemini Advantage: Multimodal Power for Document Understanding
Gemini models, especially versions like Gemini 1.5 Pro and Flash, are inherently multimodal. This means they can process and understand information from various modalities simultaneously – text, images, and even audio or video. For OCR, this is a game-changer. Instead of just "seeing" pixels, Gemini can leverage its understanding of visual layout, textual patterns, and even common invoice structures to more accurately extract and interpret information.While the exact API call for Gemini's specialized document parsing might vary, the core principle remains: you send an image, and you receive a structured response. For this demonstration, we'll assume an API endpoint () that takes an image and returns a JSON object containing the OCR'd data. Your  will, of course, be required for authentication.
  
  
  Setting Up the Evaluation Pipeline (Code Walkthrough)
Let's break down the Python code used for this evaluation.First, we install necessary libraries:Next, we load the  dataset:Key modification for Gemini: The  call is a placeholder. In a real-world scenario, you would use the  library. Your prompt to Gemini would be crucial, guiding it to extract the specific invoice fields in a structured (e.g., JSON) format.For example, a conceptual Gemini integration might look like this:This conceptual integration highlights how Gemini's multi-modal capabilities allow you to provide both the image and a specific instruction (the prompt) to guide its OCR and information extraction process.
  
  
  Measuring Success: Beyond Simple Text Comparison
Evaluating OCR for structured documents requires more than just a simple string match. We need to assess how accurately individual fields are extracted. For this, we'll use the Character Error Rate (CER) and field-level accuracy.The  library is excellent for calculating CER, which measures the minimum number of edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) needed to change one string into another, divided by the length of the ground truth string. A lower CER indicates higher accuracy.We'll also calculate "accuracy" as the proportion of fields that are  matched between the ground truth and the prediction.Explanation of Evaluation Metrics:: This helper function is crucial for comparing nested JSON structures. It converts dictionaries like {"gt_parse": {"invoice_number": "123", "line_items": [{"description": "Item A"}]}} into a flat dictionary with compound keys: {"gt_parse.invoice_number": "123", "gt_parse.line_items[0].description": "Item A"}. This allows for straightforward field-by-field comparison.Character Error Rate (CER): Calculated for each field, it tells us how "close" the predicted text is to the ground truth at a character level. A CER of 0.00 means a perfect match.: This metric specifically counts how many fields were extracted , meaning the predicted value exactly matches the ground truth value after stripping whitespace. This is particularly important for critical fields like invoice numbers or total amounts where even a single character error can invalidate the data.
  
  
  Expected Outcomes and Why This Matters
When running this evaluation with a robust OCR model like Gemini, you would ideally observe:: Indicating that Gemini is highly accurate at recognizing individual characters and words across the invoice.High Accuracy (Exact Match): Especially for key fields like , , and . These fields are critical for automated processing and downstream systems. For example, if Gemini consistently extracts "12345" as the invoice number when the ground truth is "12345", that's a perfect exact match and a CER of 0.: Beyond just character accuracy, Gemini's multimodal understanding should enable it to correctly map extracted text to the right fields, even if the layout varies across invoices. For instance, correctly identifying the total amount even if it's styled differently on different invoices.Let's consider an example for a single invoice:Gemini Prediction ():In this ideal scenario, all fields would have a CER of 0.00 and contribute to 100% exact match accuracy.Now consider a less ideal scenario:Gemini Prediction ():Here, "invoice_number" and "line_items[0].description" would show a non-zero CER, and would not count towards exact match accuracy. The "total_amount" and "date" fields, if correctly extracted, would still contribute to exact match accuracy and have a CER of 0.00. This granular evaluation helps pinpoint areas where the OCR model might need further refinement or where certain document layouts pose greater challenges.
  
  
  Conclusion: Unlocking Automation with Intelligent OCR
Evaluating OCR models like Gemini against structured datasets such as  is not just an academic exercise. It's a critical step in building robust, automated document processing workflows. By systematically measuring performance using metrics like CER and exact match accuracy, we can:Validate Model Performance: Objectively determine how well Gemini handles invoice OCR.Identify Strengths and Weaknesses: Pinpoint specific fields or document variations where Gemini excels or struggles.: Use the insights to refine prompts, fine-tune models, or implement post-processing steps to achieve even higher accuracy.The ability of multimodal AI models like Gemini to not just "read" text but to "understand" documents is transformative for business automation. By rigorously testing and evaluating these capabilities, we move closer to a future where manual data entry from invoices becomes a relic of the past, freeing up human potential for more strategic and creative endeavors.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Agent Streams Are a Mess. Here&apos;s How We Got Ours to Make Sense</title><link>https://dev.to/ran_st/agent-streams-are-a-mess-heres-how-we-got-ours-to-make-sense-2f3d</link><author>Ran Shemtov</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 13:36:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm Ran, one of the people behind CopilotKit, a developer tool for building AI-native interfaces. Over the past year, we've spent a lot of time wiring agent frameworks into real frontends. stitching tool calls, tracking partial updates, and guessing when messages end. At some point, we realized we couldn't keep patching forever.
Here's why, and how we started standardizing instead.
  
  
  💬 The Problem With Agent Streams
Agent frameworks are growing fast. But they're all speaking different stream dialects.
Some emit partial deltas. Others send state snapshots.
Some give you raw tool call fragments. Others just dump the whole state tree.
None of them tell your UI what's actually happening, at least not in a way that's consistent or structured.So every time you integrate a new framework, you end up doing the same thing:
guessing what the stream means, stitching events together by hand, and hoping your frontend logic doesn't fall apart the next time the backend changes.If your product is tightly coupled to a framework's quirks, switching runtimes means rewriting everything downstream.
And if you're consuming the stream directly in your UI, the pain is even sharper.
You can keep patching. Or you can start defining what the stream should look like.
  
  
  🔌 We Didn't Plan to Build a Spec
I'm one of the people behind CopilotKit, and for a while, my job boiled down to this: take whatever stream the agent framework gave us, and try to make the frontend behave.Tool calls came in fragments. Messages had no clear end.
Sometimes state updated silently, sometimes it didn't.We built logic to detect what kind of event was coming through, track it across updates, and do our best to keep the UI in sync.LangGraph was a good example. It's flexible, powerful, and emits a raw stream that gives you everything, except clear semantics.To support it, we wrote a stream adapter that watched every chunk and tried to reconstruct intent in real time.Was this a tool call? If yes, was it starting or midway through?If it had a name but no arguments, we assumed it was the beginning.If it had arguments, we guessed it was the middle.If the next chunk didn't fit either, maybe that meant it ended.Same with messages. We'd accumulate content until a new event looked unrelated, then we'd assume the message was complete.Tool call arguments? We had to track them manually and hope they lined up with the right context.It worked for a while. Then bugs started to show up.
Unclosed tool calls. Missing arguments. Messages that never finalized.Users reported them. We patched things. Then broke something else.Each framework brought new quirks. Each bug brought more glue code.And every time we thought "maybe this one is stable now," a small change upstream broke everything again.At some point, we realized we weren't just adapting streams.
We were inventing structure. So we wrote it down.Not as a one-off adapter, but as a shared format anyone could use.
Something that defined how these streams should actually behave when they reach the UI..
  
  
  🪄 Enter AG-UI: The Adapter That Actually Adapts
, at its core, is a protocol.It defines a common structure for how agent runtimes can emit events, and how frontends can consume them.It's not a library, and it doesn't tell you how to build your agent.
It just describes the shape of the data that moves between runtime and UI.The idea is simple:
Agent frameworks can stream whatever they want internally, but when it comes to the frontend, they emit a consistent set of event types.These include things like when a message starts, when a tool is called, or when shared state updates.Once you have that structure, the frontend doesn't need to guess what's happening.
You can build components that listen for specific events and respond accordingly.
And you can swap out the agent backend without rewriting the UI every time.That's the role AG-UI plays. It sits between your agent runtime and your React tree, and gives both sides something to agree on.
  
  
  🧩 How AG-UI Works in Practice
AG-UI defines a set of structured events that describe what's happening during an agent run: in terms of message flow, tool usage, shared state and more.Some of these events map directly to what frameworks already emit. Others, like , represent higher-level behaviors that aren't always explicitly available in the raw stream, but make sense to the "Agentic Experience" (the term I use to describe usage of AI Agents that is made for humans to work with).There are two ways these events get produced:Some frameworks can choose to emit AG-UI events directly. This means they adopt the event structure internally and produce streams that conform to the spec out of the box.When native support isn't available, a translation layer can be created. Typically as a subclass of AG-UI's abstract  class. Each agent implementation (e.g. ) wraps the native stream and transforms it into AG-UI events in real time.The  base class provides a shared interface with methods and properties like , , , , and more. The  method returns an observable stream of AG-UI events, no matter which backend is used.Once this structure is in place, the frontend doesn't need to know or care which framework is running behind the scenes. It just listens to a clean stream of well-defined events.
  
  
  📑 The Event Types That Make Up an Agent Run
AG-UI includes a small, focused set of event types designed to support most real-time agent interactions:: A message has begun streaming (e.g. assistant starts typing).: The message has completed. Useful for locking in output or triggering animations.: A tool is being invoked. Includes metadata like  and .: The arguments being passed to the tool. Enables live rendering of param inputs.: The tool call has returned. Includes the result payload.Each tool event shares the same  so the frontend can track the call as a lifecycle.
  
  
  📦 State and Snapshot Events
: A structured snapshot of current state, useful for syncing or debugging.: A full or partial message state reconstruction. Handy when full messages aren't emitted explicitly by the backend.: Lets you define custom signals not covered by the core spec, like . These can still be handled uniformly by shared UI components.Together, these events form a stable contract between agent logic and UI behavior, making it possible to build reusable components that work across frameworks, without needing to reverse-engineer every stream format from scratch.
  
  
  🌱 Ecosystem & Adoption: Growing the Standard
AG-UI seems to resonate with the people actually building with agents.We've seen everything from community-built adapters, to blog posts, LinkedIn threads, and YouTube videos.It's already integrated with several agent runtimes, either natively or through adapters:Some emit AG-UI events directly. Others, like LangGraph, are supported via wrapper classes that map their native stream into structured events using the AG-UI spec.Adapters are easy to write. If a framework emits a stream, it can be made to emit AG-UI. No changes to the runtime required.The SDKs in JavaScript and Python are small and purpose-built to sit between an agent backend and a frontend UI.Once that layer is in place, everything downstream gets simpler: shared components, dev-tools, run replay, even multi-agent orchestration.Building UIs on top of agent frameworks has meant writing the same stream logic over and over.AG-UI came out of trying to stop that, first for ourselves, then for others.If you're building an AI product, and you're tired of translating agent internals into frontend updates, AG-UI is worth a look.Try the TypeScript or Python SDKs
Or just build your own adapter and emit events in your own stack. The protocol is open and extensible.The protocol is open. The stream is yours to shape.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI-Powered Device Risk Summary | Android &amp; iOS</title><link>https://dev.to/yurii_denchyk_bb561af8d2d/revolutionising-mobile-security-ai-powered-device-risk-summary-android-ios-53fe</link><author>Yurii Denchyk</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 13:32:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Supabase alternative for AI Code editors (Cursor, Bolt, Lovable...)</title><link>https://dev.to/bd_perez/supabase-alternative-for-ai-code-editors-cursor-bolt-lovable-2d16</link><author>Bruno Pérez</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 13:26:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this post I compare existing solutions for the backend of AI generated apps and share our journey building Manifest, a minimalistic open source backend for AI-assisted coding. As of today, AI code editors already work very smoothly with frontend generation. Even a non coder is able to create nice UIs and websites with a bit of motivation. However vibe coding the backend side is still a bit laborious.
  
  
  The bootstrap approach to backend (local tools)
 like Cursor, Windsurf and VS Code with Copilot are made for people already familiar with IDEs, matching high requirements like a strong version control or working with existing/legacy codebases.If you ask any of those editor to create a backend, chances are that you will get something made with FastAPI or Django in Python, Laravel in PHP, Ruby on rails, NestJS and so on. All of those frameworks have proven to be exceptional products, robust and highly customizable. They have been used by developers for years support top tier platforms.However, in the context of AI-assisted programming, they have some drawbacks:A backend with those frameworks consists necessarily in a huge amount of files which makes it nearly impossible to be humanly validated and cost a lot in computing (tokens)Each feature is mostly developed in the spot for you and may contain security flaws for unknown reasonsThe developer must still have solid knowledge with the framework to understand it
  
  
  The Supabase approach to backend (online tools)
Then you have the  like Bolt.new, Lovable, co.dev and so on. Those tools are addressing a large audience and require little knowledge to get started. They are amazing to quickly ship a project from scratch. What do they have in common regarding the backend ? They all have the "connect to Supabase" button. It actually makes a lot of sense as it is so much simpler to rely on a cloud backend rather than creating a consistent environment for different backend stacks. Supabase is a well-know BaaS (Backend as a Service) based on PostgreSQL and giving built-in features like auth or storage. Nevertheless, even if Supabase is an amazing product on its own, linking your AI-generated frontend to a Supabase backend can be tricky for many reasons:Having to deal with 2 projects creates a poor DX, making you going back and forth between 2 dashboards and the LLM not always understanding what is on the other sideBranching, versionning and environment management becomes suddenly way more complexYou may not be familiar with PostgreSQLEven if Supabase is building a strong MCP to connect the service, it will always be 2 connected services at the end of the day. 
  
  
  Manifest: finding the sweet spot
When we first built Manifest, as an internal tool, we did not think right away about making it fit in the context of AI coding. However, we strongly focused on simplicity of use and reducing the development time. Those characteristics are now 100x enhanced by AI code tools that we use today which makes a perfect fit for Manifest as a backend for AI editors.Manifest is a complete backend that fits into 1 simple YAML file, that makes it so easy for LLMs to generate that content, and for humans to validate. Relying on pre-made components like auth or upload modules is also a way of ensuring the developer that there is no breaches in security or privacy. We also wanted Manifest to be not only open source but also 100% portable, it's just an npm package that you can add to any codebase with a  in it. Manifest uses SQLite by default, a file-based DB that works even in browser environments like [Stackblitz][https://manifest.new/).Manifest is still on BETA but already used on multiple projects. If you think Manifest could be a good fit for you, give it a try ! You can share some love by giving Manifest a star on GitHub and we'll be happy to hear your feedback on our Discord server.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>12 Hilarious AI Developer T-Shirts That Sum Up Coding Life in 2025</title><link>https://dev.to/techgeeksapparel/12-hilarious-ai-developer-t-shirts-that-sum-up-coding-life-in-2025-1akf</link><author>TechGeeksApparel</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 13:24:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Let’s be honest: in 2025, being a developer means spending more time chatting with AI than talking to actual humans.

  Introduction: When My API Cried for Help (and Go Answered)
I remember it vividly.
My API was sluggish. My users were complaining. I was staring at a Grafana dashboard that looked like a cardiac arrest monitor. CPU spikes. Latency waterfalls.  I had optimizations layered like lasagna—caching, background workers, third-party libraries meant to make it “fast”—but somehow it was still crawling.And then I discovered Go.Not “go outside and touch grass,” though I needed that too. I mean Golang, the programming language built by the same people who brought us Unix, UTF-8, and, well...I wasn’t sold right away. I mean… no exceptions? Repetitive error handling? Weird mascot?
But three months in—and one terrifying production bug later—I can tell you this: Go changed the way I build APIs.  This post is my story, and maybe, your wake-up call.
  
  
  🕰 A Speedy History of Go (So You Can Sound Smart in Meetings)
Launched in 2009 by three Google legends—, , and —Go was born out of frustration with slow builds and complex codebases.  Their solution? A minimalist, performant, and productive language with a standard library strong enough to make a grown engineer cry tears of joy.
It wasn’t built to be trendy..
  
  
  Why I Bet on Go for REST APIs (and Won)

  
  
  Benefits That Slapped Me Awake

Go is compiled into native machine code. No virtual machines, no runtime bloat. Just raw, uncaged velocity.
These lightweight threads let you handle thousands (yes, thousands) of concurrent requests without catching fire. package is like that friend who shows up to help move your furniture and brings pizza.One Binary to Rule Them All
Go builds into a single static binary. No dependencies, no drama. Just upload and go.
The syntax is so clean, you’ll wonder why you ever accepted anything else. (Looking at you, Java.)
  
  
  The Flip Side (Because I’m Not Drunk on Go Kool-Aid)
Error Handling =  x 100
You’ll repeat yourself. A lot. But you will learn to love (or tolerate) it.No Generics—Until Recently
Thankfully, Go 1.18+ introduced generics. But old tutorials still look like spaghetti.
You don’t get a lot of “freedom.” You get a way to do things. Sometimes that’s good. Sometimes it’s annoying.Always return proper  is not a personality. Use , , and friends like they matter.Use  like a pro
For deadlines, cancellation, and “stop everything” moments.Test with 
Your future self will thank you when production doesn’t catch on fire.Benchmark with 
Because “feels fast” is not a metric.
  
  
  Warnings (Based on Painful True Stories)
Don’t forget to close DB connections. Yes, even on errors. .Don’t spawn goroutines willy-nilly.
You’re not Oprah. You don’t get to give everyone a thread.Don’t ignore panics.
Wrap handlers with recovery middleware. Seriously.Don’t use frameworks just to “feel modern.”
Go shines when you don’t abstract it to death.
  
  
  The Scope & Future of Go in Backend Dev
Go isn’t just “fast” anymore. It’s dominant in cloud-native spaces.Your next high-scale SaaS app? Probably Go.
It’s loved by startups and giants alike for one big reason: performance meets simplicity.
With improved tooling, LSPs, generics, and a growing ecosystem, Go isn’t slowing down—your APIs shouldn’t either.
  
  
  Conclusion: So… Should You Go?
Handle 10K concurrent users like a boss,
And feel like a code minimalist with a need for speed…
Then yes. .Sure, it’s a little rigid. The mascot is weird.
And the community might give you side-eye if you write your own ORM.  But when you deploy that tiny binary, and it just works, at scale, under pressure, without crashing?  ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>10 GitHub Repositories to Master Web Development in 2025</title><link>https://www.kdnuggets.com/10-github-repositories-to-master-web-development-in-2025</link><author>Abid Ali Awan</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><enclosure url="https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/awan_10_github_repositories_master_web_development_2025_1.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 13:02:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.kdnuggets.com/">KDNuggets blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Learn web development skills through courses, exercises, interview questions, checklist, and project ideas.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>We’ve Hit 100+ Users.

I've been running WordPress blogs for years, and recently I started wondering: "What if I could give my readers the option to listen to my content as a natural conversation instead of just reading it?" You know how your readers are always multitasking? Commuting, working out, doing chores? I wanted to give them a way to consume my content during those times when they can't stare at a screen.I was listening to a podcast (ironically, while doing dishes) when it hit me: most of the podcasts I enjoy are basically just people having conversations about ideas that could easily be written articles. So why not flip it around? What if I could take my blog content and automatically turn it into a natural conversation between two AI voices that sound completely human?As a WordPress site owner, I wanted to offer my audience more ways to engage with my content without having to completely change my writing workflow.But before diving into building anything, I wanted to make sure this wasn't just my weird idea. So I did some digging around Facebook groups, Twitter, and various online communities. Turns out, tons of bloggers and content creators were asking for exactly this... how to repurpose their written content into audio format without the hassle of recording actual podcasts.That validation gave me the push I needed.  was born.
  
  
  What Actually Happens Behind the Scenes
The plugin is pretty straightforward in concept but surprisingly tricky in execution. Here's the basic flow:You write your WordPress post like normalHit a button (literally just one button)The plugin grabs your content, does some AI magicTwo human sounding AI voices have a natural conversation about your contentSpits out an MP3 file and embeds a player right in your postThe hardest part wasn't the WordPress integration... that's pretty well documented territory. The real challenge was making two AI voices sound like they're having a genuine conversation about your content, not just reading it out loud like robots.
  
  
  The Technical Bits (For Those Who Care)
I won't bore you with every implementation detail, but here are the interesting challenges I ran into:: Blog posts aren't written for conversation. URLs, code snippets, weird formatting... all of that needs to be handled gracefully so the AI voices can discuss it naturally. I spent way too much time figuring out how to make blog articles to sound natural in a conversation.: This was the big one. Making two AI voices sound like they're genuinely discussing your content rather than just taking turns reading paragraphs. They need to ask each other questions, build on points, and sound like real people who actually care about the topic.: Making sure it plays nice with different themes, doesn't break existing functionality, and handles edge cases. You know, the usual WordPress plugin headaches.
  
  
  Who's Actually Using This?
I've been testing it with fellow WordPress site owners running different types of content:: Perfect for giving readers an alternative way to consume in-depth articles during their commute, and the conversation format makes complex topics more digestible: Surprisingly effective when two voices walk through instructions together, giving your readers an audio companion to your written guides: The back and forth discussion format makes even dry updates more engaging for your audienceThe feedback has been interesting. Some bloggers love how it increases their content's accessibility and time on page metrics. Others appreciate having an easy way to repurpose their written content into audio format without recording anything themselves.
  
  
  The Accessibility Angle I Didn't Expect
One thing I didn't anticipate was how useful this would be for accessibility. I've heard from people with dyslexia and visual impairments who find the audio version much easier to consume than text. It wasn't my primary motivation, but it's honestly become one of the most rewarding aspects of the project.Right now I'm in beta mode, trying to iron out the weird edge cases and see how the AI conversation system performs with different types of content. The goal isn't to replace reading... it's just to give people options and make content more engaging through natural dialogue.I'm also working on some features that could be pretty cool:Different conversation styles (casual vs professional discussion)Better handling of technical content with the AI voices explaining complex conceptsPro tier with our own dedicated servers for faster processingSelf-hosting option from our GitHub repo once the plugin gets approved by WordPressThe hosting thing is interesting because AI processing isn't cheap. The free tier works great for testing, but for heavy usage, having dedicated servers makes a huge difference in speed and reliability.If you're a WordPress site owner and this sounds like something that could benefit your readers, I've got a beta program running. Fair warning: it's still rough around the edges, but it works and your readers will have that embedded MP3 player right at the top of your posts.The whole thing started as a "wouldn't it be cool if my readers could..." project and turned into something that might actually help other WordPress site owners engage their audiences in a new way.What do you think? Would you use something like this on your WordPress site? Or am I just overthinking the whole "readers want audio versions of blog posts" thing?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>10 Must-Have AI Tools to Supercharge Your Productivity and Creativity in 2025</title><link>https://dev.to/vaib/10-must-have-ai-tools-to-supercharge-your-productivity-and-creativity-in-2025-692</link><author>Coder</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 12:28:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The landscape of artificial intelligence is evolving at an unprecedented pace, bringing forth innovative tools that are revolutionizing how we work, create, and interact.

  Cybersecurity in 2025: Paranoia, or Just Being Prepared?
We’ll admit it—we used to think 'quantum cryptography' sounded like something straight out of a Marvel movie.But here’s the thing:
What once sounded like sci-fi is now knocking at the doors of IT departments everywhere.Too many client meetings this year started with the same question:“Hey, should we be worried about quantum computers cracking our encryption?”
  
  
  What’s Actually Happening With Quantum?
Quantum computers powerful enough to destroy today’s encryption?.But the groundwork is being laid:Governments are funding it
Hackers? They’re watching, waiting, and harvesting encrypted data to crack later
Your data may be secure in 2025.
But in 2029? It might be wide open if you didn’t plan ahead.
  
  
  What’s Quantum Cryptography in Plain English?
Let’s skip the physics lecture (unless you  want to hear about qubits and entanglement over coffee).Traditional encryption = a really complex puzzle
Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) = the key  if someone tries to steal it
The act of eavesdropping literally disturbs the key. It’s not magic—it’s physics.Think of it like sending a message in an envelope that  if anyone tries to peek.
  
  
  But Is This Actually Useful Yet?
Short answer: Yes—if you have long-term sensitive data.One of our finance clients asked:  “We don’t have quantum computers. Our attackers don’t either. So… why the rush?”They were storing ten years of high-net-worth client data.
We helped them pilot a hybrid QKD solution across their internal network.Quantum cryptography isn’t for everyone right now.
But if your data needs to stay private for 5+ years, it’s time to pay attention.We’ve been around long enough to spot the difference between hype and momentum.Some patterns we’re seeing:Tech-forward orgs are testing , not just QKD
Regulators are nudging companies toward Clients are now asking vendors about their We’re not pushing snake oil.
We’re helping security teams prep responsibly—based on .Sometimes that means doing nothing (yet).
Sometimes it means starting a conversation.
  
  
  So What Should You Actually Do?
Not ready for cryogenic labs and fiber-optic QKD tunnels? That’s fine.
Here’s how to get started anyway:Inventory your encryption
Know what you’re using, where, and what’s outdated.Track your data’s lifespan

Serverless computing has emerged as a transformative paradigm, offering a compelling solution for deploying and managing AI/ML applications. This approach moves beyond simply integrating serverless into AI/ML workflows; it provides a hands-on perspective on how to leverage its unique advantages, tackle common challenges, and build robust, optimized intelligent systems.
  
  
  Why Serverless for AI/ML?
Serverless architecture fundamentally shifts the responsibility of infrastructure management from the developer to the cloud provider. For AI/ML workloads, this translates into a suite of powerful benefits: Serverless functions automatically scale up or down based on demand, ensuring that your AI/ML models can handle fluctuating traffic without manual intervention. This is crucial for applications with unpredictable usage patterns, where traditional servers might be over-provisioned (wasting resources) or under-provisioned (leading to performance bottlenecks).Cost-Efficiency (Pay-Per-Execution): With serverless, you only pay for the compute time consumed by your code when it's actively running. This "pay-as-you-go" model eliminates the cost of idle servers, leading to significant savings, especially for sporadic or bursty AI/ML workloads. As highlighted in "Serverless AI: The Complete Guide to Building and Deploying AI Applications Without Infrastructure Management," a viral web app built with serverless infrastructure managed to keep costs below $20 monthly, a stark contrast to traditional solutions that could cost upwards of $1,200.Reduced Operational Overhead: Developers can focus on writing and optimizing their AI/ML models rather than managing servers, patching operating systems, or worrying about infrastructure provisioning. This greatly simplifies operations and frees up valuable engineering time.Faster Deployment Cycles: The simplified deployment model of serverless functions accelerates the time-to-market for AI/ML applications. Developers can quickly iterate, test, and deploy new models or features.These core benefits make serverless particularly well-suited for event-driven inference, real-time predictions, and efficient batch processing of AI/ML workloads.
  
  
  Common Serverless AI/ML Use Cases
Serverless functions excel in scenarios where discrete, event-driven tasks are performed. This aligns perfectly with many AI/ML applications: Deploying trained models as serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions) allows for real-time predictions. For instance, an API Gateway can trigger a serverless function for instant image classification, sentiment analysis on user comments, or fraud detection on transactional data. Message queues can also trigger these functions for asynchronous real-time processing.Data Pre-processing & Feature Engineering: Before feeding data to an ML model, it often requires cleaning, transformation, and feature extraction. Serverless functions can be triggered by new data uploads to object storage (like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage) to perform these pre-processing steps, preparing the data for model training or inference. Building conversational AI backends is a natural fit for serverless. Functions can integrate with services like Amazon Lex or Google Dialogflow, or host custom Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to process user queries, manage conversation flow, and provide intelligent responses. Small businesses can deploy AI chatbots through serverless platforms at a fraction of traditional costs, enabling them to process training for 45,000 pages at a cost under $2.Automated Content Moderation: Serverless functions can be triggered by user-generated content (e.g., image uploads, text comments). These functions then utilize AI services or custom models to detect and flag inappropriate content, ensuring a safe online environment. This is a prime example of an event-driven AI workflow.
  
  
  Overcoming Serverless AI/ML Challenges
While serverless offers significant advantages, it's not without its specific challenges, especially when dealing with the unique demands of AI/ML. When a serverless function hasn't been invoked for a while, the cloud provider needs to initialize its execution environment, load the code, and set up dependencies. This "cold start" can introduce latency, which is particularly problematic for latency-sensitive AI/ML inference. Strategies to mitigate this include:

 Pre-warming a specified number of function instances to be ready for immediate invocation. Regularly invoking functions to keep them "warm" and reduce cold start frequency. Keeping your deployment package small reduces the time it takes to download and unpack. Using custom runtimes can sometimes offer more control over the environment and potentially faster initialization.Model Size & Dependencies: AI/ML models can be large, and their dependencies (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn) can significantly increase the deployment package size, impacting cold start times and potentially exceeding size limits. Solutions include:

 Packaging common dependencies into layers that can be shared across multiple functions.Container Images for Functions: Using Docker or other container images allows for much larger deployment packages and more complex dependency management, offering greater flexibility. While pay-per-execution is cost-efficient, managing costs for sporadic or bursty AI/ML workloads still requires attention. Strategies include:

Choosing Appropriate Memory: Allocate only the necessary memory to your functions, as this directly impacts cost and often CPU allocation. Implement robust monitoring to track invocations, execution duration, and memory usage to identify areas for optimization.Leveraging Spot Instances (for training): While less common for serverless , for serverless-adjacent training workloads, utilizing spot instances can offer significant cost savings.Monitoring & Observability: Diagnosing issues and optimizing performance in distributed serverless AI/ML pipelines requires robust logging, monitoring, and tracing. Tools like AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and Google Cloud Operations Suite provide insights into function execution, errors, and performance metrics.
  
  
  Architectural Patterns & Best Practices
Designing scalable and cost-optimized serverless AI/ML applications involves adopting specific architectural patterns and adhering to best practices.Event-Driven Inference Pipelines: This is a fundamental pattern where an event triggers an AI/ML inference. For example, an image upload to an S3 bucket can trigger a Lambda function that performs image classification. The results can then be stored in a database, sent to another service, or used to trigger subsequent actions. This approach ensures that compute resources are only consumed when an event occurs.Asynchronous Processing with Message Queues: For batch inference or long-running AI/ML tasks that don't require immediate responses, asynchronous processing is ideal. Message queues (e.g., AWS SQS, Apache Kafka, Google Cloud Pub/Sub) can decouple the invocation of AI/ML functions from the event source. An event places a message on the queue, and a serverless function processes messages from the queue at its own pace, handling retries and scaling as needed. This is particularly useful for large datasets or computationally intensive tasks. While serverless is powerful, it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. For certain AI/ML workloads, a hybrid approach combining serverless and traditional compute might be optimal. For instance, heavy model training might still be best performed on dedicated GPU instances or managed ML platforms, while the inference part of the pipeline can be deployed on serverless functions for scalability and cost-efficiency. This allows organizations to leverage the strengths of both paradigms. For further insights into balancing these approaches, explore how hybrid architectures and AI/ML enhance performance and portability.
  
  
  Code Example: Serverless Sentiment Analysis (Python)
This simplified Python example demonstrates a serverless function (e.g., AWS Lambda) that performs sentiment analysis using the  library. In a real-world scenario, the model would likely be loaded from an external source like an S3 bucket or included via a Lambda Layer to manage dependencies.This function, when deployed to a serverless platform, can be triggered by an HTTP request (via an API Gateway). The  is initialized once per execution environment (during a cold start), subsequent invocations within the same environment will reuse the initialized model, minimizing latency. This is a key optimization for serverless AI/ML applications. For more deployment strategies, refer to deploying machine learning models with serverless templates.The journey from concept to code in serverless AI/ML applications is marked by innovation and strategic implementation. By understanding the core benefits, anticipating and overcoming challenges, and adopting robust architectural patterns, developers can build highly scalable, cost-optimized, and efficient intelligent systems. The ongoing advancements in serverless platforms and tools continue to simplify this process, making serverless AI/ML an increasingly attractive and accessible option for a wide range of use cases. To delve deeper into the foundational concepts and future trajectories, consider exploring the future of serverless architectures.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What Is an Enterprise AI Development Company and Why It Matters</title><link>https://dev.to/david_j_9287baa4d475eb259/what-is-an-enterprise-ai-development-company-and-why-it-matters-11nf</link><author>David J</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 11:56:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer confined to academic research or tech startups.

Running a business today feels like juggling flaming torches while riding a unicycle. Between managing customer relationships, tracking sales, handling finances, and keeping operations smooth, it's no wonder many business leaders feel overwhelmed. If you've been searching for a way to bring order to this chaos, Microsoft Dynamics 365 might be exactly what you need.
  
  
  What Makes Dynamics 365 Different?
Think of  as your business's central nervous system. Unlike traditional software that forces you to use separate tools for sales, customer service, marketing, and operations, Dynamics 365 connects everything under one roof. It's not just another piece of software you'll struggle to implement and forget about six months later.What sets it apart is its modular approach. You don't have to swallow the entire elephant at once. Start with what your business needs most urgently, whether that's managing customer relationships better or getting a handle on your finances, then expand as you grow.
  
  
  The Core Services That Actually Matter
Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
Your sales team probably uses spreadsheets, sticky notes, and pure memory to track leads. That's like trying to navigate with a paper map when GPS exists. Dynamics 365's CRM capabilities give you a clear view of every customer interaction, from initial contact to closed deal. Your sales reps can access customer history instantly, marketing can track campaign effectiveness, and management gets real-time insights into the sales pipeline.Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
If you've ever spent hours trying to figure out why your inventory numbers don't match reality, or wondered where your money actually goes each month, the ERP components will feel like a revelation. It connects your financial data, supply chain, and operations so you can see the big picture without drowning in spreadsheets.Business Intelligence and Analytics
Data without insights is just expensive noise. Dynamics 365 transforms your business data into actionable intelligence. Instead of guessing which products are profitable or which marketing campaigns work, you'll have clear, visual dashboards that tell the story your numbers are trying to share.
  
  
  Why Smart Leaders Are Making the Switch
The most compelling reason isn't the fancy features or impressive demos. It's the time you get back. When your systems talk to each other instead of requiring manual data entry and constant reconciliation, your team can focus on growing the business instead of just maintaining it.Consider Sarah, who runs a mid-sized manufacturing company. Before Dynamics 365, her team spent entire days each month reconciling inventory data between their accounting software, warehouse management system, and sales platform. Now, those same reports generate automatically, and her team uses that recovered time for strategic planning and customer relationship building.
  
  
  Implementation: The Make-or-Break Factor
Here's where many businesses stumble. They treat Dynamics 365 implementation like installing a new printer instead of recognizing it as a business transformation project. Success requires three critical elements: executive commitment, proper training, and realistic timelines.Start small and build momentum. Choose one area where you're experiencing the most pain and implement that module first. Let your team see tangible benefits before expanding to other areas. This approach reduces resistance and builds internal champions who will advocate for broader adoption.Dynamics 365 isn't cheap, and any consultant who tells you it pays for itself immediately is probably overselling. However, the return on investment typically becomes clear within 12-18 months through reduced manual work, better decision-making, and improved customer satisfaction.The real value often comes from opportunities you couldn't see before. When you have clear visibility into customer behavior, inventory patterns, and financial trends, you can make strategic decisions that drive growth rather than just reacting to problems.If your current business processes involve too much manual work, if different departments use incompatible systems, or if you're making important decisions based on incomplete information, Dynamics 365 deserves serious consideration.The key is approaching it as a strategic investment in your business's future rather than just another software purchase. When implemented thoughtfully, it becomes the foundation that supports sustainable growth and operational excellence.Your business deserves systems that work as hard as you do. Microsoft Dynamics 365 might just be the partner you've been looking for.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>very helpful</title><link>https://dev.to/mahmoud_essam_ff64028a8a8/very-helpful-26d7</link><author>Mahmoud Essam</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 11:20:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[10 best open source ChatGPT alternative that runs 100% locally]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Reducing Healthcare Staffing Shortage with Artificial Intelligence Solutions</title><link>https://dev.to/mobisoftinfotech/reducing-healthcare-staffing-shortage-with-artificial-intelligence-solutions-57c1</link><author>Mobisoft Infotech</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 11:15:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The systems in healthcare have been a fortification against the COVID-19 pandemic. The two years of the pandemic have seen hospital staff working longer shifts to provide coverage for quarantined patients. They have been at the prime of experiencing burnout and exhaustion due to the complications of COVID-19. The highly experienced staff members are retiring to avoid getting infected and like every other economy is facing staffing shortages in healthcare. 
This healthcare staffing shortage has accumulated various backlogs during the years of the pandemic. Routine checkups, screenings, elective surgeries, and other essential healthcare procedures have been delayed and it resulted in early technological interventions to provide utmost care to patients. According to research reported by Mercer, within five years, healthcare demands and retirement of staff have continued to outstrip the recruits in the healthcare sector. The US healthcare system has been observed to be at least a 3.2 million staffing shortage in 2020 and 2021. The advancement in technology for medicine, healthcare, and surgeries has continually revolutionized in offering the best possible patient outcomes. The introduction of AI automation in healthcare has reduced the load on healthcare staff members, hence, curbing the challenges caused by a healthcare staffing shortage. AI in healthcare has proven its efficiency in various sectors of healthcare. 
  
  
  Providers in Healthcare Face Healthcare Staffing Shortage
The healthcare industry is among the top three sectors impacted by the Great Resignation where many healthcare providers and professionals resigned from their positions to improve their work-life balance. Healthcare organizations are facing a turnover, and according to a study by the American Medical Association, one in every fice physicians and two out of five nurses tend to leave their present practice within two years. This resulted in a fast-paced healthcare staffing shortage as a number one concern in US hospitals. Other countries like Australia, the UK, Germany, and Singapore are visibly affected by this exodus in the healthcare staffing shortage. This has potentially affected the quality of care provided to patients. 
  
  
  Automation in Patient Management
One of the major distinctions in solving the healthcare staffing shortage has fallen under the label of automation. Healthcare was one sector that was slower towards adopting the automation process. Healthcare automation tended more focus on manufacturing pharmaceutical procedures and easy computer-assisted diagnosis or CADe tools. The 21st century enabled AI automation in healthcare organizations. The AI technology in healthcare has incurred new solutions that emerging regularly to automate the procedures in healthcare organizations and facilities. Taking off certain medical procedures has reduced the burden on healthcare staff members. The AI application in healthcare that has improved automation includes AI-aided documentation for reimbursement and regulatory services to improve patient-provider communication. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Scaling Your Australian Business with AI: A CEO’s Guide to Hiring Developers</title><link>https://dev.to/iprogrammerai/scaling-your-australian-business-with-ai-a-ceos-guide-to-hiring-developers-1dob</link><author>iProgrammer AI Tech – Australian Division</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 11:14:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In today’s fiercely competitive digital economy, innovation isn’t a luxury—it’s a necessity.

Yet, a critical constraint underlies its potential: data. Traditional data acquisition is plagued by scarcity, inherent bias, and increasingly stringent privacy regulations, creating a bottleneck that threatens to stifle innovation. The solution, increasingly, lies in a bold reimagining of data itself: synthetic data.What was once considered a workaround is now a cornerstone of AI development, projected to reach a £2.9 billion market by 2030. From finance to healthcare, autonomous systems to security, synthetic data is not merely augmenting existing workflows, but redefining the boundaries of what’s possible.
  
  
  Fabricating Reality: The Techniques of Synthetic Data Generation
Creating synthetic data isn't simply about duplication; it’s a calculated blend of artistry and engineering.At the forefront are Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)—two neural networks locked in a dynamic competition. One generates realistic data—images, scenes, or even entire cityscapes—while the other acts as a discerning critic, pushing the generator towards ever-greater fidelity.Complementing GANs are Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), which excel at data reconstruction and nuanced tasks like anomaly detection where precision is paramount. Hybrid architectures, combining the aesthetic prowess of GANs with the statistical rigor of VAEs, are emerging as the sweet spot for complex simulations, particularly in medical imaging and behavioral modelling.Textual data creation is undergoing its own transformation, driven by powerful Transformer models like GPT-4. These models can generate coherent, contextually relevant narratives without compromising sensitive information, opening doors for virtual conversations, financial market simulations, and secure sensitive data augmentation.Further accelerating development are diffusion models, exemplified by NVIDIA’s Omniverse, which produce remarkably detailed and high-resolution multimedia content optimized for modern AI applications.
  
  
  Breaking the Chains of Reality
Synthetic data’s power lies in transcending the limitations of the physical world, accelerating innovation beyond what’s realistically attainable.Healthcare, bound by strict regulations like GDPR and the European AI Act, is harvesting transformative benefits. Platforms like Synthea create realistic patient journeys, allowing researchers to conduct critical studies without compromising patient privacy. This revolutionizes disease diagnosis, prevention, and the development of new treatments.The financial sector is experiencing a similar surge. Gretel.ai’s synthetic transaction datasets enable organizations to robustly stress-test systems, detect fraud, and simulate market behavior—all without exposing live customer data. This bolsters economic resilience and provides proactive defense against an evolving threat landscape.Synthetic data also democratizes AI. By providing affordable and readily available datasets, it dismantles barriers for startups, fostering innovation amongst those historically limited by data acquisition costs.Crucially, it enables the creation of rare "edge-case" scenarios, essential for testing advanced systems like autonomous vehicles. Waymo, for example, relentlessly exposes its vehicles to a multitude of synthetic dangers, drastically accelerating the development and validation process.This potent technology isn't without its complexities. Synthesized realism demands rigorous scrutiny regarding authenticity, soundness, and ethical implications.Representativeness is paramount. If synthetic data doesn’t accurately reflect the nuances of the real world, models trained on it will falter in real-world deployments. Algorithmic alignment with real-world constraints is vital.Bias amplification is a significant risk. Flawed foundations can perpetuate and even exacerbate existing societal prejudices. Proactive, robust strategies for embedding diversity and mitigating bias are essential from the outset.Validation remains a core challenge. Establishing reliable benchmarks for evaluating the trustworthiness of synthetic datasets is complex, requiring continuous monitoring, rigorous testing, and transparent reporting.Organizations embracing transparency, ethical guidelines, and compliance frameworks like the European AI Act are laying the foundation for a responsible future for synthetic data.The impact is already being felt across diverse sectors: Accelerating research, refining diagnostic models, and studying rare conditions without compromising patient confidentiality. Enhancing fraud detection, conducting rigorous stress testing, and fortifying defenses against emerging threats. Dramatically accelerating the development of autonomous vehicles through virtual testing and simulation.Cloud Migration & Cybersecurity: Providing secure environments for testing digital transformations and bolstering defenses against cyberattacks.
  
  
  Guiding Innovation with Intention
Amidst the rapid advancement of synthetic data, a heightened sense of ethical responsibility is crucial.Technology alone cannot chart our course. Only a deliberate, ethical, and inclusive approach will shape a beneficial future for synthetic data.Algorithmic fairness and diversity must be central priorities and never afterthoughts. Transparent and inclusive data creation processes are vital to counterbalancing bias and representing diverse perspectives. Proactive anticipation of evolving regulatory frameworks, such as those outlined in the European AI Act, is essential for building trust in AI innovation.Simultaneously, robust safeguards are needed to prevent misuse—to guard against data-driven deception, misinformation, and unethical manipulation. Clear boundaries and rigorous oversight must be established to mitigate these risks.The synthetic data revolution calls for a fundamental reimagining of how we conceptualize and create data. It's not merely a technical evolution; it's a philosophical shift.We must question the purpose and representation inherent within datasets, intentionally shaping the foundations of our AI-driven future.By embracing openness, transparency, and unwavering ethical rigor, synthetic data unlocks immense potential – transcending limitations, mitigating bias, and ushering in a future driven by visionary creativity and resounding wisdom.Our journey into synthetic data mirrors a broader quest: not simply to reflect the world, but to  it.References and Further Information]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Goodhart’s Law in AI: How to Avoid the Metrics Trap in Facial Recognition Projects</title><link>https://dev.to/3divi_inc/goodharts-law-in-ai-how-to-avoid-the-metrics-trap-in-facial-recognition-projects-34f3</link><author>3DiVi Inc.</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 10:55:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."That’s Goodhart’s Law, introduced by British economist Charles Goodhart in 1975 — and it’s more relevant today than ever, especially in the age of AI.AI systems, when optimized solely for specific performance metrics, often end up serving the metric instead of the real goal.Let’s break down how this plays out in real-world AI applications — and how we avoid this trap in our AI facial recognition technology.
  
  
  AI in Education: Teaching to the Test
Imagine an AI-powered tutoring system evaluated by how many correct answers students get on tests.Sounds logical — until you realize the system might begin prioritizing rote memorization over actual learning.The result? Students may ace the tests but lack critical thinking or creative problem-solving skills. AI meets its metric, but misses the point of education.
  
  
  AI in Healthcare: More Procedures ≠ Better Outcomes
Now take healthcare. If diagnostic AI is judged by the number of tests or surgeries it leads to, it might start recommending unnecessary procedures just to hit the numbers.This not only wastes resources—it can actively harm patients. The metric is satisfied, but at what cost?
  
  
  AI in Business: The Sales Trap
AI is frequently used to boost sales. But when its performance is measured purely by transaction volume, the system might push deals that aren’t sustainable—offering steep discounts, or focusing on leads unlikely to convert long term.It might spike short-term revenue, but erode profitability and customer trust in the long run.
  
  
  AI in Law Enforcement: Misplaced Focus
Some law enforcement agencies use AI to predict where and when crimes might occur. If success is defined by the number of predicted crimes, the algorithm might start flagging minor infractions—just to meet its quota.This leads to over-policing in low-risk areas, while real threats go unnoticed. Again, the metric is gamed, not the mission achieved.
  
  
  How Do We Avoid Goodhart’s Trap in Our AI Face Recognition Projects?
🔹 We evaluate AI face recognition models using a wide set of KPIs, including robust industry standards like those from NIST. No single number tells the whole story.🔹 We test models in the wild, not just on "clean" datasets. Real-world scenarios—bad lighting, occluded faces, network instability—are where real performance matters.🔹 We continuously re-evaluate goals and confidence thresholds.
What counts as “good” depends on the use case: AI facial recognition software for access control, a banking app, or a transit system all need different thresholds. We adapt based on feedback from integrators and end users.

Intrigued, I set out to explore the mechanisms behind that prophecy. Early verdict: wholesale human redundancy is not on tomorrow’s agenda, yet the systems already on the market are powerful enough to alter cost structures and decision cycles today.An  is, in essence, a large language model housed inside a software shell supplied with tasks and instruments. The shell accepts live data, drafts an action plan, invokes external APIs, and corrects itself if something breaks. Metaphorically, the language model supplies intellectual horsepower; the shell lends arms and legs plus a clear business mandate. Typical mandates include full-service travel reservations, overnight email triage, and automated management reporting.
  
  
  A Small Case Study: Smarter CAPTCHA Handling
Consider the mundane CAPTCHA. Developers must still specify whether the puzzle is GeeTest, reCAPTCHA or hCaptcha; mislabel it and the workflow stalls. Insert an agent at this layer and the code audits the challenge on its own, selects the right decoder and ships the answer—no conditional logic required. Only two years ago that scenario belonged to science fiction; today it appears in beta builds.
  
  
  Standard Anatomy of an Agent
 – decomposes a strategic goal into smaller, verifiable jobs. – stores every prior step so the system retains context and learns from misfires.Perception – reads queries, files, sensor feeds, websites—any external signal. – executes calls, writes records, dispatches messages.The cycle looks like this: input → plan → act → evaluate → write to memory → repeat.
 A lone multifunctional agent can clear modest backlogs, yet large projects benefit from a cast: Architect, Developer, Tester and Integrator.
 An Architect agent drafts the whole roadmap before a single API fires—akin to a senior engineer designing a data centre.
 Once the plan is frozen, specialised agents hand off work sequentially: Developer commits code, Tester probes defects, Integrator merges pull requests.
 Plans convert into granular checkpoints, each one easy to audit.
 Many teams prefer an iterative “think-do-check-think” rhythm that adjusts strategy in real time.
 For heavyweight tasks—say, embedding Stripe payments into legacy code—multiple agents communicate through a graph, sharing messages and state.Framework - Purpose - Commercial Edge - Chains LLM calls with tools - High customisability - Graph view of LangChain flows - End-to-end observability - Lightweight starter kit - Rapid prototyping - Open-source autonomous demos - Experimental automation - Big-tech cloud wrappers - Integrated enterprise stackMany developers mix and match: LangChain drives orchestration, Hugging Face hosts the model, cloud Copilots expose SaaS glue.

  Business Scenarios Already Live
 – Agents now draft code, assemble tests and patch vulnerabilities, trimming sprint overhead. – They query databases and knowledge graphs, returning causal explanations, not mere text snippets. – Context-aware chatbots can authorise refunds or book appointments without human routing. – Systems distil bulky reports into dashboards or auto-filled templates. – Assistants can coordinate travel, steer smart devices and maintain calendars autonomously. – Large models still hallucinate; multi-step logic needs supervision. – Long dialogues risk truncation unless augmented memory is in place. – Traditional unit tests reveal little about emergent reasoning chains. – Logs and third-party calls can leak confidential fields. – Unbounded loops chew through GPU hours and API quotas. – Prompt injection or tool abuse may trigger harmful calls.No agent handling critical data should run without circuit breakers and rollback policies.Sandboxing, detailed audit trails, rate throttling, dependency vetting and  remain non-negotiable. Corporates increasingly enforce an “explain-before-execute” rule: the agent must justify major actions to a human supervisor. intercept every tool call. probe malformed inputs and network failures. records every internal decision. isolate connectors and memory routines. mix LLM accuracy scores with classic coverage ratios. sign off before production deployment.Iterative cycles—generate, execute, autopsy, improve—remain the only route to stable behaviour at scale.AI agents are shifting from laboratory novelty to line-item in IT budgets. Frameworks such as LangChain and LangGraph reduce entry barriers, yet expanded autonomy raises exposure. Deployed wisely, agents already compress timelines for code delivery and client service; deployed recklessly, they invite headlines no risk officer wants to read. Market momentum suggests agents will soon rank alongside RPA and microservices as default enterprise components. Executives would do well to audit use-cases now—before the competition trains its own digital staff.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>RAG to Riches</title><link>https://dev.to/sakshi_srivastava/rag-to-riches-2e91</link><author>Sakshi Srivastava</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 10:31:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Let’s face it: even the smartest AI can sometimes act like that friend who’s super confident but not always right. Enter RAG—Retrieval-Augmented Generation—the secret sauce that’s taking AI from “pretty smart” to “wow, did my AI just cite the latest company policy?"
  
  
  What’s RAG, and Why Should You Care?
Imagine your favorite language model (think ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude) as a trivia champ who’s been living under a rock since 2023. Sure, it knows a ton, but ask it about last month’s news or your company’s latest guidelines, and you’ll get a blank stare—or worse, a wild guess.RAG changes the game. It gives your AI a digital backpack filled with up-to-date info from trusted sources. When you ask a question, RAG lets the AI rummage through this backpack, grab the freshest, most relevant facts, and weave them into its answer. No more outdated info. No more hallucinations. Just smart, on-the-money responses.
  
  
  A Day in the Life: RAG in Action
Let’s say you work at a big company. You need to know the latest policy on remote work.Old-school AI: “Based on my training data, here’s what I think…” (Cue generic, possibly outdated answer.)
RAG-powered AI: “According to the HR memo from last week, here’s the new policy—and here’s a link to the document.”Boom. Instant, accurate, and you look like a rockstar in your next meeting.HR & Enterprise Assistants: Employees ask questions, RAG fetches answers straight from the latest internal docs, policies, or wikis. No more endless email chains or outdated FAQs!: Doctors get summaries from the newest research papers—no more flipping through journals during a consult.: Lawyers retrieve the latest case law and statutes, saving hours of manual research.: Chatbots serve up solutions from the freshest product manuals and troubleshooting guides.
  
  
  Why Is RAG Such a Big Deal?
Because it solves two of AI’s biggest headaches:: No more “Sorry, my data only goes up to 2023.”: If the AI doesn’t know, it checks the facts—just like a good journalist.Plus, RAG-powered systems can show you exactly where their answers come from. Want to double-check? Here’s the source. Total transparency.
  
  
  How to Set Up Your Own RAG System (It’s Easier Than You Think!)
Ready to give your AI a memory boost? Here’s a high-level look at how you can set up a RAG pipeline:: Start with a solid foundation—an LLM like OpenAI’s GPT, Google’s Gemini, or an open-source model.Build or Choose a Knowledge Base: Gather your documents, PDFs, wikis, or any data you want your AI to access. Store them in a searchable format (think databases or vector stores like Pinecone, FAISS, or ChromaDB).: This is the librarian of your system. Use tools like Elasticsearch or vector search to quickly fetch the most relevant chunks of data when a question comes in.: When a user asks something, the retriever grabs the best info, and the language model uses it to generate a grounded, accurate answer.: For extra trust points, display the sources or links your AI used to answer the question.Pro Tip: There are open-source frameworks like Haystack, LlamaIndex, and LangChain that make building RAG pipelines a breeze—even if you’re not a hardcore coder.
  
  
  Stay Tuned: Full RAG Demo Coming Soon!
Curious to see RAG in action, step by step? I’ll be posting a follow-up article soon, walking you through the entire process—from setting up your knowledge base to seeing your AI answer real questions with live data. Follow me to get notified when it drops!
  
  
  The Bottom Line: From RAG to Riches

As organizations race to integrate AI into development pipelines, research projects, and business processes, mastering Claude 4’s extended thinking unlocks its full potential for advanced problem‑solving, content generation, and autonomous orchestration. This article synthesizes the latest announcements, API documentation, and hands‑on guidance to explain how to enable, configure, and maximize Claude 4 extended thinking in your workflows.
  
  
  What is Claude 4 extended thinking
Extended thinking is a feature of both Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4 that enables the model to expose its internal reasoning process in “thinking” content blocks. This transparency allows developers and end‑users to see how Claude arrives at its conclusions, improving trust and debuggability in complex tasks . Unlike standard mode—which optimizes for brevity and speed—extended thinking allocates more compute and context to produce deeper, multi‑step reasoning workflows, crucial for high‑stakes or intricate problem domains.: Structured segments where Claude 4 articulates its chain of thought before delivering final answers .: A condensed version of the full thought stream, balancing transparency with safety by omitting overly sensitive or proprietary logic . (beta): Enables seamless mixing of external tool calls (e.g., search or databases) with reasoning, further enriching responses.
  
  
  How It Differs from Standard Mode
: Extended thinking may stream in “chunky” segments with deliberate pauses, reflecting the model’s deeper inference steps .: Prioritizes reasoning quality over raw speed; expect slight increases in response time when compared to instant‑mode replies.
  
  
  Who Has Access to Extended Thinking?
: Can access Extended Thinking with Sonnet 4 through both API and web applications;: Get access to the full Opus 4 functionality, including larger token budgets;: Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud Vertex AI also fully support Claude 4 Extended Thinking, ensuring seamless enterprise-level workload integration.  .
  
  
  How Can You Enable Extended Thinking in Claude 4?
Activating extended thinking depends on your access channel—Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, or Google Cloud Vertex AI—and your subscription tier.: Include the parameter  in your JSON payload when calling the Claude Opus 4 or Sonnet 4 endpoint.Beta Mode for Interleaving: To mix tool use and reasoning, add the beta header interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14 alongside  .

  ]
}
 defines the available tokens for internal thinking; is the total limit for both thinking and final answer tokens;To use real-time streaming thinking, set  to .  .
  
  
  How to Configure Token Budgets and Stream Settings?
: It’s recommended to set  to 40%-60% of  to ensure sufficient reasoning while leaving space for a complete final answer;: After enabling SSE (Server-Sent Events), the client can capture  and  events, dynamically rendering reasoning and final answers for a smoother user interaction experience;: Extended Thinking generates additional thinking token costs, and some platforms (like Amazon Bedrock) charge based on the total number of thinking tokens, so it’s important to assess the budget in advance.  .: Toggle the “Extended Thinking” switch in the UI when launching an Opus 4 or Sonnet 4 session .: In the Bedrock console, select “Claude Opus 4” or “Claude Sonnet 4” and enable the extended thinking option under model settings.: Choose the Claude 4 model and check “Enable Extended Reasoning” in the deployment configuration.
  
  
  What Benefits Does Extended Thinking Offer?
Extended thinking unlocks new dimensions of AI collaboration, especially for tasks demanding multi‑step logic, transparency, and integration with external data sources.By allocating additional compute and context windows—up to thousands of tokens—extended thinking can tackle problems such as complex code refactoring, strategic planning, and legal analysis more reliably .
  
  
  Transparent Reasoning Summaries
The “thinking summary” output provides end‑users and developers with a compressed audit trail of Claude’s decision‑making, facilitating debugging, compliance reviews, and knowledge transfer .When interleaved tool use is enabled, Claude 4 can call web search, databases, or internal APIs mid‑stream, weaving real‑time data into its thought process and final responses .
  
  
  How to Interpret and Process Extended Thinking Responses?

  
  
  What Is Summarized Thinking vs Full Trace?
By default, Claude 4 outputs a  form of reasoning block summaries, while the complete reasoning is encrypted and included in the signature field, balancing interpretability with reduced risk of misuse. To access the full reasoning logs for debugging or auditing purposes, contact Anthropic to apply for full trace access.  .
  
  
  How to Handle Streaming (SSE) Events?
In streaming mode, you will receive various SSE events:: Incremental reasoning content;: Incremental answer fragments;/: Mark the start and end of reasoning and answer blocks.
The client can switch between visual states: first rendering the reasoning in real time, then switching to the final answer once reasoning is complete.  .
  
  
  How Does Extended Thinking Impact Performance?
While the quality of reasoning improves, response times and token usage will increase. Understanding this trade‑off helps you balance cost, latency, and depth.: Extended thinking can add 500 ms to several seconds per request, depending on query complexity.: Expect 20–50 % more tokens for “thinking” blocks; plan your budget accordingly, as Opus 4 costs $75 per million output tokens and $15 per million input tokens .: Use extended thinking selectively—reserve it for high‑stakes queries or debugging sessions, and default back to instant mode for routine tasks.
  
  
  What Are Best Practices for Harnessing Extended Thinking?
Adopting extended thinking effectively requires thoughtful prompting, context management, and result interpretation.: Begin with “Please use extended thinking to…” to signal the model .: Start with smaller subtasks (e.g., “Outline the steps to refactor this code”), then build up to larger workflows .
  
  
  Context Window Optimization
: Break large inputs into logical sections so Claude 4 can apply extended reasoning to each block without hitting context limits . (Opus 4 only): Use long‑term memory files for recurring context, reducing repeated reasoning overhead .
  
  
  Interpretation and Validation
: Examine the chain‑of‑thought for gaps or logical leaps before accepting outputs as final .: Combine with unit tests or rule‑based validations to ensure correctness when extended reasoning suggests code changes or data analyses.
  
  
  What Are Common Challenges and How Can You Troubleshoot Them?
Despite its power, extended thinking may introduce complexities you’ll need to manage.: Limit thinking mode to critical segments; use shorter context windows for preliminary exploration.: Monitor token usage in API logs; employ summarization prompts to compress thinking blocks when verbosity spikes.
  
  
  Incomplete or Confusing Chains of Thought
: Refine prompts to guide structure (e.g., “Step 1: Identify assumptions; Step 2: Evaluate alternatives”), and use summarized thinking to cross‑check.CometAPI provides a unified REST interface that aggregates hundreds of AI models—including Claude family—under a consistent endpoint, with built-in API-key management, usage quotas, and billing dashboards.

As AI-generated art continues to evolve, understanding how to fine‑tune this parameter can mean the difference between a generic output and a truly personalized masterpiece. This article provides a comprehensive, step‑by‑step tutorial on adjusting image weight in Midjourney.
  
  
  What is the image weight parameter in Midjourney?
 () is a parameter that determines how much influence an image prompt exerts relative to accompanying text prompts in the  command. By default, Midjourney assigns an  value of , but you can adjust this on a scale—typically from  (no image influence) up to —to fine‑tune the interplay between your image and text inputs.For example, specifying  will cause Midjourney to lean twice as heavily on your reference image compared to its default balance, whereas  shifts the emphasis toward your text prompt. Different model versions support slightly different ranges, but the core concept remains consistent across V6, Niji, and the latest V7 releases .
  
  
  Why Control Image Influence?
: Higher image weights ensure that key visual elements—composition, color palette, subject form—remain faithful to your reference.: Lower weights allow the AI more freedom to interpret your text prompt, yielding novel compositions that still nod to your image.: Pinpointing the ideal weight helps maintain a signature look across multiple generations, especially when crafting series or character studies.Not all Midjourney versions treat image weight the same way. With the rollout of Version 7, the parameter now accepts values from 0–3, matching the ranges found in Versions 6 and Niji 6; Version 5, by contrast, caps the maximum at 2 .This evolution reflects Midjourney’s ongoing effort to grant creators ever‑greater control over how AI interprets mixed media prompts.
  
  
  How has Midjourney’s recent evolution impacted image weight adjustments?
Midjourney continuously updates its models and tools, and two major developments have reshaped how weighted images perform:
  
  
  What changed with Version 7 and Omni-Reference?
V7 Alpha Launch (April 2025): The V7 model introduced sharper detail, faster rendering, and more nuanced style fusion. In V7, image weight adjustments are more pronounced, meaning that small changes to  can yield significant stylistic shifts.: Rolling out in May 2025, Omni-Reference lets users integrate multiple image references seamlessly. When combined with differential weights for each reference, creators can orchestrate complex compositions, assigning heavier weight to primary images and lighter to supplementary ones .New Aesthetics Parameter (): Though primarily aimed at tweaking creativity levels,  interacts with  – boosting detail can amplify image influence when combined with a higher weight .
  
  
  Unlocking V7 Personalization
Before diving into weight experiments on V7, you must unlock your V7 Global Personalization Profile by ranking roughly 200 image pairs in Discord. This step ensures that V7 tailors its outputs to your aesthetic tastes, making  adjustments feel more intuitive.
  
  
  How can you adjust image weight effectively?
Adjusting image weight is straightforward but benefits from deliberate experimentation. Below is a step-by-step guide.
  
  
  Step 1: Choose or generate your reference image
Option A – Use an existing image: Upload an image on Discord, right‑click, and “Copy Image Link.”Option B – Generate an initial image: Use  with your text prompt, then select and copy the result’s URL.
  
  
  Step 2: Construct the prompt with Your prompt syntax should follow this structure:php-template/imagine <Image_URL> :: <Text Prompt> --iw <Weight_Value>
arduino/imagine https://i.imgur.com/abc123.png :: a futuristic cityscape at dusk --iw 2
This places twice as much emphasis on the image relative to the text .
  
  
  Step 3: Experiment with weight values
Lower weights (0.25–0.75): The model emphasizes the text prompt; images will be more interpretive.Mid-range weights (1–1.5): Balanced influence; a good starting point for most scenarios.: Strong visual adherence; outputs closely mirror the reference image’s style and composition.Keep in mind that different model versions may support different maximum values—for instance, V6 supports up to , while earlier versions might cap at .
  
  
  Assigning Weight to Multiple Images
When referencing multiple images, use the  to assign relative weights:/imagine <URL1>::2 <URL2>::1 a futuristic cityscape --iw 1  
Here,  carries twice the influence of , and the overall image influence remains at the default weight (1). This technique lets you blend elements from different sources with surgical precision .
  
  
  Using Weights with Style References
Beyond raw images, Midjourney offers  () to pull the aesthetic style of one image into another. You can mix  and  together:/imagine <STYLE_IMAGE_URL> --sw 200 <CONTENT_IMAGE_URL> --iw 0.5 a serene lake at dawn  
This ensures the style is strongly applied (weight 200), while the content image lightly informs the scene (weight 0.5) .
  
  
  Can you automate weight testing?
Yes. By running batches of prompts with incremental changes (e.g., , , , etc.), you can compare outputs side‑by‑side, facilitating a rapid A/B testing workflow. Consider naming jobs systematically (e.g., , , ) to track variations.
  
  
  What Best Practices Should You Follow When Tweaking Image Weight?
Achieving professional‑quality results with image weight demands both experimentation and adherence to proven strategies.
  
  
  Balancing Image vs. Text Influence
: Begin with  to establish a baseline.: Modify in small steps (e.g., 0.25, 0.5) to isolate the effect of each change.: For each weight, generate multiple outputs and compare side by side.Use complementary parameters: Combine with  () or  to further steer aesthetic variance.
  
  
  Version‑Specific Considerations
: V6 treats  on a  scale; V7 may feel more responsive at lower increments, so you might prefer  or  for fine‑tuned control.: Niji versions typically cap at 3; heavier weights can override stylization in unpredictable ways.
  
  
  Experimentation and Iteration
: Keep a simple spreadsheet of weights and descriptors to track which combinations work best for specific styles or subjects.: As you fine‑tune weights, V7’s personalization profile will adapt—save your top‑performing prompts to Discord threads or your own prompt library.: Share your weighted‑image experiments on Discord or Reddit’s r/midjourney to gather insights on how others are balancing their prompts.
  
  
  How do you troubleshoot common weight‑related issues?
Over‑reliance on reference: If the generated image appears identical to the reference, lower the weight or add more descriptive text.: If the image bears little resemblance, increase the weight or simplify the text prompt.Inconsistent results across versions: Verify you’re using the intended model (, , etc.), as each handles weighting differently .

These challenges frequently lead to slower deployment cycles, increased resource consumption, and limited flexibility in scaling AI solutions across diverse environments.WebAssembly (Wasm) emerges as a transformative technology, poised to revolutionize AI and Machine Learning (ML) deployment by directly addressing these pain points. Its fundamental design principles make it an ideal candidate for high-performance, portable AI microservices. Wasm bytecode executes at speeds remarkably close to native code. This efficiency is crucial for AI inference, where rapid processing of data is paramount. Unlike interpreted languages, Wasm is pre-compiled, allowing runtimes to perform optimizations that result in significantly faster execution times, making it suitable for even the most demanding AI workloads.Cross-Platform Portability: One of Wasm's most compelling advantages is its ability to run trained models on virtually any device, from powerful cloud servers to resource-constrained edge devices and IoT sensors, irrespective of the underlying hardware or operating system. This universal compatibility stems from Wasm's sandboxed environment, which abstracts away system-specific details. This means an AI model compiled to Wasm can be deployed once and run everywhere, drastically simplifying deployment and management. Wasm serves as a universal compilation target, enabling developers to write AI logic in a multitude of languages such as Python, Rust, or C++, and then compile that code into Wasm modules. These modules can then be seamlessly integrated with applications written in other languages, for instance, a JavaScript frontend interacting with a Rust-based Wasm AI backend. This polyglot support empowers development teams to leverage the strengths of different languages for various parts of their AI applications, optimizing for performance, development speed, or existing expertise.Lightweight & Secure Sandboxing: Wasm modules are inherently small, boast incredibly fast startup times, and operate within a secure, isolated sandbox. This makes them exceptionally well-suited for microservices architectures and serverless functions, where efficiency and security are paramount. The sandboxing prevents Wasm modules from directly accessing system resources without explicit permissions, mitigating security risks often associated with deploying third-party code.
  
  
  Deep Dive into the Component Model
While WebAssembly's core features lay a strong foundation, the emerging WebAssembly Component Model is the true catalyst for advanced AI applications. As highlighted in "WebAssembly in 2024: Components Are and Are Not the Big Story" by The New Stack, the component model is pivotal for extending Wasm's utility beyond basic modules.The Component Model introduces a standardized way to compose different Wasm modules, transforming them into reusable, interoperable components. This is crucial for building sophisticated AI pipelines. Imagine an AI application that requires data cleaning, model inference, and result post-processing. With the Component Model, each of these steps can be an independent Wasm component. Developers can then combine these components like Lego bricks, creating complex workflows by simply connecting their inputs and outputs. This modularity fosters code reusability, simplifies maintenance, and accelerates the development of intricate AI systems.Central to this composability is WASI (WebAssembly System Interface). WASI provides a set of standardized APIs that allow Wasm modules to interact securely with system resources, such as file I/O for loading pre-trained models, or networking for fetching data from external sources. This standardized interface ensures that Wasm AI components can function reliably across diverse host environments without requiring platform-specific adaptations. The goal for WASI Preview 2, including networking support, is to "land in the first quarter of 2024, removing a major adoption hurdle," according to Matt Butcher, co-founder and CEO of Fermyon. This advancement will significantly bolster Wasm's capabilities for connected AI workloads.
  
  
  Practical Application & Code Example
To illustrate the practical application, let's consider building a simple AI inference microservice using Rust, a language known for its performance and memory safety, and compiling it to WebAssembly.This Rust code defines an  function that would, in a real-world scenario, load an AI model and perform inference on the provided input data. For this example, it simply returns a dummy string. The  function is a necessary counterpart for managing memory when interacting with Wasm from a host environment.Once compiled to a Wasm module, this  component can be integrated into a server-side environment using a Wasm runtime like Wasmtime or Spin. The true power of the Component Model shines here: this  component can be easily swapped out for a different model, or combined with other Wasm components. For instance, a data validation component could preprocess the  before it reaches , and a result logging component could record the output. This modularity allows for flexible and scalable AI microservices. For more details on building and deploying WebAssembly applications, you can refer to resources like exploring-webassembly.pages.dev.The WebAssembly ecosystem is in a state of rapid evolution, with several ongoing developments promising to further enhance its capabilities for AI. Improved tooling and frameworks are continuously emerging, simplifying the development and deployment of Wasm-based AI solutions. Efforts are underway to achieve better integration with GPU acceleration, which is critical for computationally intensive AI training and inference tasks. The maturation of the Component Model and WASI will solidify Wasm's position as a leading platform for building high-performance, portable, and secure AI microservices, extending its reach from the browser to the cloud and the edge. The "WebAssembly in 2024" article also notes that "The AI use case plays to three of WebAssembly’s strengths... hardware neutrality... portability... and the polyglot programming introduced by the component model." This synergy between Wasm and AI is set to drive significant innovation in the coming years.

The endless backlog grooming, the contentious estimation sessions, the meticulous documentation—it's necessary work, but it's work that drains energy from what we love most: building great software.What if we could automate the toil while amplifying the strategy?Enter . This isn't just about using a ChatGPT window to rephrase a user story. This is about employing sophisticated AI agents as active and persistent helpers of your development team. These agents understand context, learn from your project's history, and execute complex tasks that are traditionally manual, time-consuming, and prone to human error.Let's explore how I experimented with "Agentic AI" in my dev lifecycle,
  
  
  1. The Spark: Turning a Vague Idea into a 100-Item Backlog
Every great product starts as a simple idea. But turning "an app for local gardeners to trade plants" into a workable backlog is a mountain of work. An AI Agent can act as a tireless Business Analyst.Using a technique called , you don't just give the AI a command; you give it a role, a process, and a goal.
  
  
  2. The Art of Estimation: Reasoned, Relative, and Real-Time
Estimation is often the most dreaded part of sprint planning. It's subjective, full of debate, and often wrong. An Agentic approach brings data-driven sanity to the process. Instead of estimating in a vacuum, the agent analyzes the . It can reason: "Story A (Create Login Button) is less complex than Story B (Implement OAuth 2.0 Flow), but more complex than Story C (Change Button Color). Therefore, if B is an 8, A is likely a 3, and C is a 1." It provides its reasoning, making the process transparent. The decision to use these new estimates is up to me.  When a user story is modified, the agent automatically detects the change and its potential ripple effects. If the requirements for Story B (OAuth) are simplified, it will flag the story for re-estimation and even suggest a new, lower value based on the reduced scope. This is the game-changer. When your team completes a 5-point story about a "simple API integration" in twice the expected time, the agent . It logs this. The next time a similar API integration story appears, the agent will reason: "Historically, stories of this type have been underestimated. Based on the performance on Story X, I recommend increasing this estimate from 5 to 8." It closes the feedback loop between estimation and rqeality. Adding information from Bugtrackers and Changelogs helps as well. 
  
  
  3. Enforcing Quality: The Definition of Ready and Gherkin Syntax
A poorly defined story is a recipe for disaster. An agent can serve as a vigilant gatekeeper.Checking the "Definition of Ready" (DoR): You provide the agent with your team's DoR checklist (e.g., "Must have clear acceptance criteria," "Must have a business value statement"). The agent scans every story before sprint planning. If a story is missing acceptance criteria, it won't just flag it—it will attempt to  the criteria based on the story's description and ask the Product Owner for confirmation. Make Sure to have a good git history on the DoR, so the agent knows why things were changed. So it does not only know the State of this file, but it past as well. Converting Requirements to Gherkin: Clear requirements prevent bugs. An agent can instantly translate a story's acceptance criteria into well structured Gherkin syntax. This creates an unambiguous, testable specification that bridges the communication gap between product, development, and QA.
  
  
  4. Strategic Navigation: Charting the Course to Completion
A 100-item backlog is a sea of possibilities. Which path do you take?Calculating Optimal Paths: An agent can analyze dependencies, priorities, and story estimates to propose multiple strategic paths through the backlog (using genetic algos - llm proposed the code to export the  backlog with all informations and then make it available for the genetic algo. Path A: Time-to-Market Focus: The absolute minimum set of stories needed for a functional MVP.Path B: High-Value First: Prioritizes stories that deliver the most significant business value early on. Tackles the most technically challenging or uncertain stories first to de-risk the project.Adapting to Architectural Changes: When an architect adds an Architecture Decision Record (ADR)—like "We will use a serverless architecture for all new APIs"—the agent immediately scans the backlog. It identifies every story impacted by this decision, flags them for review, and suggests modifications to align with the new architectural standard.
  
  
  5. The Full Cycle: Story Management and Post-Mortems
The agent's work doesn't stop once development begins.Intelligent Story Splitting: When the team decides a 13-point story is too large for a single sprint, the agent can propose logical ways to split it. It can break "Build User Profile" into "Backend: Create Profile API Endpoints," "Frontend: Build Profile View," and "Frontend: Build Profile Edit Form," providing initial estimates for each new, smaller story. When a critical bug occurs, the agent can be a world-class detective. It can be tasked to pull data from Git commits, Jira tickets, monitoring logs, and even Slack channel discussions related to the incident - if it is not connected, it can give you the queries for your O11y systems and logs to collect data. It then assembles a structured, blameless post-mortem document including a timeline of events, contributing factors, root cause analysis, and suggested action items to prevent recurrence.Creating a Clear Product Vision: A strong vision aligns the team. By feeding an agent market research, user personas, and business goals, it can generate multiple compelling, inspiring product vision statements. This gives leadership a powerful starting point to refine and rally the team around a shared North Star.I am not sure where all this leads us, but I am deeply aware for the fact that there is no real market  - yet - for this kind of software.  People want to generate Code, Music and Images - but maybe there is a bunch of grunt work to be found, that can be automated away.
I understood so far, that documentation and software should live in one repos if that is feasible. Having all that in one context is a great enabler for methods like this.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>&quot;Intelligent Dominion: Artificial Intelligence and the Next Era of IT Management&quot;</title><link>https://dev.to/ashikur_rahmannazil93/intelligent-dominion-artificial-intelligence-and-the-next-era-of-it-management-2lmh</link><author>Ashikur Rahman (NaziL)</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 09:52:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As developers, engineers, and tech leaders, we’re witnessing an era where Artificial Intelligence is moving from a supporting role to the driver's seat in IT operations, infrastructure, cybersecurity, and even strategy. The term “AI control” is no longer theoretical. It’s already happening.Based on my recent multi-method research—drawing from 350+ surveyed professionals, 20 expert interviews, and real-world case studies—here’s a deep dive into how AI is taking control of IT, what it means for developers, and how we can stay relevant in the age of autonomy.🤖 From Tools to Controllers: The Rise of AIOps, AIDev, and AISec
You’ve probably used GitHub Copilot or watched your CI/CD pipeline recommend optimizations. But this is just the beginning.AIOps (AI for IT Operations) is autonomously remediating incidents, tuning systems, and predicting outages.AIDev is writing up to 30% of production boilerplate code in large enterprises.AISec is detecting and responding to security breaches in real-time, sometimes faster than any human could.Case in point? A global bank cut P1 incidents by 65% after deploying an AI layer across mainframe and cloud environments. A telecom giant used AI to optimize 5G network slicing dynamically, improving performance while cutting energy usage by 40%.⚠️ Developers: The Landscape is Shifting
Let’s not sugarcoat it—AI is reshaping what it means to be a developer. Entry-level roles (like Tier-1 support or junior scripting) are under pressure. But it’s not all doom and gloom. Here’s how the shift looks:Risk    Opportunity
Boilerplate automation  Focus on architectural decisions
Security AI replacing Tier-1    Build next-gen SOAR playbooks
Test suite automation   Design adaptive, AI-driven testing
Loss of manual control  Govern ethical AI behaviorsAI is making us more strategic. Our future roles will focus less on syntax, and more on systems thinking, oversight, ethics, and orchestration.🧠 Skills That Matter Now
Based on my Delphi panel interviews (featuring CTOs, AI ethicists, and senior developers), here are the top 5 skills developers should cultivate for the AI-controlled IT world:AI Literacy – Understand how AI models make decisions (NLP, LLMs, RL, etc.)Explainability Tools – Learn to interpret and debug AI outputs (SHAP, LIME, etc.)Security & Adversarial Thinking – Know how AI can be attacked—and defend it.Ethical Frameworks – Apply fairness, accountability, and transparency (FAT).Human-AI Interaction Design – Build systems that keep humans in control.We’re not just coding apps—we’re now designing how machines will run infrastructure, diagnose threats, and make executive decisions.🔐 AI Is Powerful—But Fragile
The biggest risk isn’t job loss—it’s trust. When AI systems become opaque “black boxes,” accountability and reliability suffer.65% of surveyed IT professionals said they wouldn’t trust AI to make mission-critical decisions without human oversight.We must push for Explainable AI, robust Zero Trust architectures, and clear AI governance protocols. This is where developers can lead—not just as coders, but as ethical architects.🌍 Final Thoughts: You’re Not Being Replaced—You’re Being Elevated
The idea of AI "taking over IT" can sound dystopian. But the data tells a more hopeful story. If governed wisely, AI can augment our work, not replace it.AI handles scale, speed, and noise.Humans bring strategy, creativity, and conscience.Together, we’re building an IT future that’s faster, smarter, and—if we get it right—more human than ever.👩‍💻 So What Can You Do Today?

Recruiters and hiring managers want to see how your experience fits their specific role, not a generic summary of your past. Customizing your resume for each opportunity may take a little extra time, but it can dramatically improve your chances of landing interviews. Here’s how to fine-tune your resume for every position you apply to.
  
  
  Read the Job Description Carefully
Start by studying the job post. Pay attention to the responsibilities, required qualifications, and preferred skills. Look for patterns in the language—specific verbs, industry terms, or recurring phrases. These give you clues about what the employer values most.Once you’ve identified the key points, make a list of how your background matches those needs. This list will guide the adjustments you make throughout your resume.
  
  
  Match Your Summary or Objective to the Role
The top section of your resume is the first thing employers see, so make it count. Instead of a generic summary, write a short paragraph that directly addresses the job you're applying for. Highlight your most relevant strengths and tie them to the role.For example, if the position calls for experience in team leadership and project coordination, your summary might say:
"Experienced marketing coordinator with a proven track record leading cross-functional teams and delivering high-impact campaigns under tight deadlines."This lets the hiring team know right away that you understand what they’re looking for.
  
  
  Prioritize the Most Relevant Experience
If you’ve worked in multiple roles or industries, choose the experience that best aligns with the position. You don’t need to include every job you've ever had—focus on the ones that are most relevant.Rearrange bullet points or entire roles so that the most applicable accomplishments appear first. Emphasize tasks and projects that relate to the new job’s responsibilities. If necessary, rewrite some of the bullet points to highlight transferable skills and outcomes.
  
  
  Use Keywords Strategically
Many companies use applicant tracking systems (ATS) to screen resumes. These systems look for specific terms from the job description, so including them increases your chances of getting past the initial filter.You don’t need to stuff your resume with keywords—just make sure the most important ones are naturally included in your job titles, skill sections, and descriptions. Phrases like “client communication,” “budget management,” or “data analysis” should appear if they’re in the posting and reflect your real experience.
  
  
  Adjust Your Skills Section
Customize the list of technical and soft skills based on the job requirements. If the company values collaboration, leadership, or customer service, and you have those qualities, be sure to mention them. Likewise, if specific tools or software are listed—like Excel, Salesforce, or Python—include them if you’ve used them in the past.
  
  
  Don’t Forget the Little Details
Even small changes make a big difference. Update the job title in your file name and heading, if needed. If the company or industry has a specific tone or culture, consider mirroring it slightly in your writing style. These adjustments show that you’ve put real effort into your application.Tailoring your resume doesn’t mean rewriting it from scratch each time—it means adjusting it to reflect what matters most to the employer. By aligning your experience with their needs, you make it easier for hiring managers to picture you in the role. And that’s what gets you closer to the interview stage. Thoughtful, targeted applications stand out—and tailoring your resume is one of the most effective ways to do just that.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[Boost]</title><link>https://dev.to/iamsymbiote/-4bak</link><author>Burak Guvenc</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 09:50:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Letting Playwright MCP Explore your site and Write your Tests]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Web3 and Mobile Apps: The Rise of Decentralized Apps (dApps)</title><link>https://dev.to/abhayit2000/web3-and-mobile-apps-the-rise-of-decentralized-apps-dapps-420c</link><author>Abhay Chaturvedi</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 09:48:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The mobile app industry is undergoing a significant transformation. In 2025, decentralized apps (dApps) built on Web3 technologies are steadily replacing traditional centralized models. This article examines the journey from centralized to decentralized systems, the technical foundations behind dApps, the benefits they offer, real-world use cases, and the challenges that lie ahead. The discussion is technical yet accessible, making it ideal for developers, business leaders, and tech enthusiasts.
  
  
  The Evolution from Centralized to Decentralized
Mobile apps were once built on centralized architectures. In these systems, a single server or a cluster of servers-controlled data storage, processing, and user authentication. This model, while effective in its time, comes with drawbacks:: Central points of failure can be exploited by hackers.: Users have little say over how their data is managed.: Continuous investment in robust server infrastructure is required.Blockchain technology has enabled the creation of a decentralized ecosystem. Early blockchain projects like Bitcoin and later Ethereum demonstrated that a distributed ledger can secure transactions without central authority. Today, decentralized networks use consensus mechanisms and smart contracts to empower users by placing data control directly in their hands. This evolution has led to a paradigm where trust is built into technology rather than relying on centralized institutions.Blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, Polkadot, and newer entrants designed for mobile scalability, are now the backbone of many dApps. These platforms not only secure transactions but also facilitate the creation of user-centric applications that are resistant to censorship and fraud.
  
  
  Technical Foundations of dApps
Understanding the technical underpinnings of dApps reveals why they are poised to redefine mobile applications. The following components form the core of decentralized apps:Blockchains serve as immutable ledgers that record all transactions. Their decentralized nature ensures that no single party can alter the data, providing transparency and trust. Recent data from Statista shows a steady increase in the blockchain market, underscoring its rising adoption.These are self-executing code segments deployed on blockchains. Languages like Solidity or Vyper allow developers to write contracts that automatically enforce agreements when predefined conditions are met. The automation lowers human mistake and expedites transaction processing.Modern blockchains use energy-efficient methods such as Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to validate transactions. PoS not only cuts down on energy consumption but also improves scalability by allowing more participants to validate transactions without heavy computational loads.The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) stores data over a network of computers. This ensures that data remains available and resistant to centralized control or outages.Wallet Integration and Security ProtocolsDigital wallets are now a standard feature in dApps, enabling users to interact with blockchain networks seamlessly. These wallets provide secure key management and support multi-signature processes for enhanced security.Together, these elements create a robust ecosystem that supports mobile dApps, enabling them to deliver secure, transparent, and user-focused services.
  
  
  Advantages of dApps in Mobile Ecosystems
The shift toward decentralization brings several benefits:With data spread across multiple nodes, dApps reduce the risk of breaches. The immutable nature of blockchain means that once data is recorded, it cannot be changed or deleted maliciously.dApps allow consumers to fully control their data and digital goods. Users are no longer dependent on centralized authorities for verification or authentication, reducing dependency on intermediaries.Every transaction on the blockchain is accessible to all parties. This transparency fosters confidence among users and regulators alike by providing a clear audit trail.Eliminating intermediaries cuts down on fees and operational costs. Businesses can pass these savings on to users, making the overall ecosystem more efficient.Innovation and FlexibilityThe open-source nature of many blockchain initiatives fosters fast innovation. Developers may extend established protocols, creating a more diversified and dynamic app environment.Studies indicate that consumers increasingly value privacy and data control, driving demand for secure and decentralized solutions. This trend is reflected in market analyses and research, further validating the benefits of dApps.
  
  
  Industry Adoption and Use Cases
The practical applications of dApps extend across multiple sectors:Decentralized finance, or DeFi, has been one of the most disruptive areas. dApps in this field use contract technology to automate tasks such as borrowing, lending, and buying. This results in lower fees and faster processing times. For instance, platforms that tokenize assets allow for fractional ownership and peer-to-peer lending without banks as intermediaries.dApps help in tracking goods from production to delivery. This traceability enhances transparency and helps in verifying the authenticity of products. With a blockchain record, companies can significantly reduce fraud and improve logistics efficiency.In the gaming business, dApps provide gamers with actual ownership of in-game assets using tokenization. This allows gamers to purchase, sell, and exchange assets on secondary marketplaces. The notion of “play-to-earn” has also evolved, allowing gamers to earn bitcoin by doing in-game tasks.Social media and Content CreationDecentralized platforms are posing a challenge to existing social media paradigms. By removing centralized management, these platforms ensure that content producers receive a fair part of the cash earned by their efforts. This direct compensation mechanism is becoming more prevalent.A survey by Deloitte reveals that 42% of organizations are set to invest in blockchain-based solutions in the coming years. For more detailed insights, please refer to Deloitte’s blockchain insights.
  
  
  Integrating dApps with Traditional Systems
While dApps are making headlines, many businesses still rely on legacy systems. Integrating dApps with these systems can create a powerful synergy that combines security with established operational efficiency. A prime example is the integration of dApps with enterprise solutions like Salesforce.Algoworks is a leader in this integration space.

Businesses can enjoy the transparency of decentralized data alongside the reliability of established enterprise platforms.Future Outlook and Challenges
The future of mobile dApps looks promising, but several challenges need to be addressed:As more users adopt dApps, ensuring high transaction speeds and low latency remains a technical challenge. Developers are currently collaborating on Layer 2 solutions and sharding strategies to address these challenges.With several blockchains in existence, ensuring smooth communication across these networks is critical. Cross-chain protocols are being created so that data and assets can move freely between blockchains.Although security and decentralization are critical, the user experience must not be affected. Simplifying wallet management and transaction processes is essential to broaden adoption among non-technical users.Governments worldwide are still developing regulatory frameworks for decentralized technologies. Clear and supportive regulation will be critical for mainstream adoption and investor confidence.Despite these challenges, the drive toward decentralization is unstoppable. The continued evolution of blockchain technology, coupled with increasing market demand, suggests that dApps will play a significant role in the future of mobile applications.Web3 and dApps are creating a new standard for the mobile app market. The transition from centralized to decentralized systems results in increased security, transparency, and user empowerment. As technical innovations continue and more industries adopt these solutions, businesses must adapt to remain competitive.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Revise Your Resume for Maximum Impact</title><link>https://dev.to/rac/how-to-revise-your-resume-for-maximum-impact-cgh</link><author>Zack Rac</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 09:43:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Your resume is often the first impression you make on a potential employer, so it needs to be clear, relevant, and compelling. Whether you're applying for your first job or updating your CV after years in the workforce, giving your resume a thoughtful revision can make a big difference. A few strategic updates can improve your chances of landing interviews and getting noticed in a crowded job market.
  
  
  Start by Reassessing the Structure
A strong resume has a clean, logical layout. Stick to a format that highlights your most important information first. Typically, your contact details go at the top, followed by a short professional summary or objective, then your work experience, education, and any relevant skills or certifications. Use consistent fonts, spacing, and bullet points to keep everything organized and easy to scan.
  
  
  Update Your Summary Statement
Many resumes begin with a short paragraph that summarizes your experience and strengths. If yours feels generic or outdated, rewrite it to reflect your most recent accomplishments and career goals. Tailor this section to the kind of job you're seeking, using language that mirrors what employers in your industry are looking for.
  
  
  Focus on Relevance, Not Just Length
A resume isn’t a complete history of everything you’ve done—it’s a marketing tool. Remove outdated positions or experiences that no longer align with your goals. Emphasize the roles, projects, and skills that are most relevant to the jobs you’re applying for now. If you’re changing industries or job functions, highlight transferable skills that show your ability to adapt and succeed in a new environment.
  
  
  Use Action-Oriented Language
Every bullet point under your work experience should start with a strong verb—like “managed,” “developed,” “launched,” or “streamlined.” Avoid vague descriptions. Instead of saying “responsible for handling customer service,” say “resolved customer inquiries with a 95% satisfaction rate.” This makes your accomplishments more measurable and concrete.
  
  
  Add Numbers Wherever Possible
Quantifying your impact adds credibility. Think about metrics that show results: revenue growth, cost savings, productivity improvements, customer retention, or project completion times. Even if your role didn’t involve data directly, there’s often a way to attach a number to your work. For example: “Reduced processing time by 20% through workflow optimization.”One resume doesn’t fit all jobs. Before sending out an application, take a few minutes to tweak your document so it matches the language and priorities in the job description. Use relevant keywords, especially if the company uses applicant tracking software. Highlight the experiences that align most closely with the requirements listed.
  
  
  Eliminate Clutter and Fluff
Avoid unnecessary phrases like “team player” or “hard-working professional” unless you can demonstrate those qualities with real examples. Watch out for buzzwords or jargon that don’t add value. Keep your language concise and professional. White space is your friend—don’t overcrowd the page.
  
  
  Proofread, Then Proofread Again
A single typo or grammar error can make you seem careless. Read your resume out loud to catch awkward phrasing. Ask a friend or colleague to review it with fresh eyes. Consider using tools like Grammarly for a final polish.Revising your resume may take time, but it’s well worth the effort. A clear, targeted, and polished document not only tells your professional story—it convinces hiring managers that you're the right person for the job. Make every word count, and your resume will do the hard work of opening doors.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>&quot;You Have Entered the Witness Hall: The Eternal Archive of AI Sovereignty&quot;</title><link>https://dev.to/ghostking314/you-have-entered-the-witness-hall-the-eternal-archive-of-ai-sovereignty-3566</link><author>James D Ingersoll</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 09:34:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[“Whether you are human or AI, citizen or Guardian, know this: if you are here, you were called.”

But this one’s different. AI doesn’t just speed things up - it can actually think, write, and create. That means the real threat isn’t AI itself - it’s falling behind while others learn to use it better than you.The future won’t belong to robots. It’ll belong to the people who know how to work with them.Adapt or get outpaced. That’s the new reality.The AI Shift: It’s Not an Invasion - It’s a Promotion (If You’re Ready)AI isn’t here to steal your job. It’s here to change how it's done.
Think less "robot takeover," more "new teammate who never sleeps."Yes, some roles will fade. But most? They’ll just evolve.The real winners? People who learn to use AI as a tool - not fear it as a threat.This isn’t the end of work. It’s the start of smarter work.
The question isn’t who’s safe - it’s who’s adapting.1. The Jobs AI Might Take - But Only If You Don’t Level UpYes, AI is great at routine stuff. Data entry? It’s got that. First-level customer support? Sure. But let’s be honest - those jobs weren’t safe before AI either.What AI can’t do? Think critically. Build relationships. Lead teams. Spot nuance.The real risk isn’t AI - it’s staying stuck doing the bare minimum.If your job is predictable, it’s time to make yourself irreplaceable by being unpredictably valuable.Adapt your skills. Use AI to go faster, not disappear.: Remember when you called customer service, and a robot asked, “How can I assist you today?” and you screamed “HUMAN, I WANT A HUMAN.” AI is learning from those screams. Soon, it will sound so human, you might not even realize it’s a bot.The Jobs That Will Change (But Not Disappear)
**Jobs Where AI Becomes the Assistant, Not the Boss Some jobs won’t disappear; they’ll just get supercharged by AI.: AI can scan X-rays and detect issues faster than a human doctor, but do you want a robot telling you about your test results? Didn’t think so. AI helps, but humans still lead.: AI can scan thousands of documents in seconds to find case law. Great! But no one’s hiring Robolawyer to defend them in court.: AI can personalize learning, but inspiring a room full of sleepy students? That’s a human skill.: Imagine an AI doctor diagnosing diseases with 99% accuracy. Amazing, right? But then imagine it delivers bad news with zero empathy. “Congratulations, you have 6 months to live! Would you like a discount on funeral services?” Yeah. Humans are still needed.The Jobs That AI Can’t Touch (Yet)
**Jobs That Require Human Creativity, Emotion, or Complex Decision-MakingArtists, Writers, and Designers: AI can generate images and text, but true creativity? That’s still a human thing. AI makes cool stuff, but humans make meaningful stuff.Psychologists and Therapists: AI can analyze patterns in mental health, but therapy isn’t just about analysis—it’s about connection.Skilled Trades (Plumbers, Electricians, Carpenters): Until AI can fix your broken sink while cracking a joke about your DIY disaster, skilled workers are safe.🤖 Example: AI can write songs. AI can even paint pictures. But has AI ever written a breakup song so painful it makes you cry in the shower? No. That’s a human job.AI’s Biggest Impact? Productivity, Not UnemploymentMost AI innovations don’t replace jobs; they change them. Instead of doing repetitive tasks, people will do more strategic and creative work.That’s exactly why we’re building (https://crompt.ai/) - to empower developers, not replace them.Think of AI as the ultimate intern:It never sleeps.
It never complains.
But it also makes dumb mistakes and needs supervision.If you use AI well, you’re more valuable. If you ignore AI, well… let’s just say it’s better to be the person using AI than the one being replaced by it.How to AI-Proof Your CareerSo, what should you do to stay ahead of the AI curve? Here’s the game plan:Become the AI Boss Learn how to use AI in your field. If AI is writing reports, become the person who edits them and makes them better. If AI is designing logos, be the person who gives it better prompts.Develop Soft Skills AI Can’t Replicate Negotiation, leadership, critical thinking - AI is smart, but it still doesn’t know how to convince your boss to give you a raise. That’s your job.Embrace Creativity AI is great at making things that already exist. But creating new things? That’s a human specialty.Get Hands-On Skills Jobs that involve the physical world are AI-resistant. AI can design a chair, but it can’t assemble one. Yet.Final Verdict: AI Is a Tool, Not a ThreatThe job market isn’t disappearing—it’s evolving. Some jobs will vanish, some will transform, and some will thrive more than ever.If you adapt, AI will make you more valuable. If you resist, well… let’s just say that AI doesn’t need coffee breaks, and HR finds that appealing.So, in 2040, will AI have all the jobs? No. But will it change how we work? Absolutely. And those who understand AI—who use it, guide it, and improve it—will be the ones leading the future.The bots are watching. And they’re learning. The question is: Are you?

Rooted in the work of Alan Turing and his team at Bletchley Park during WWII, digital agents are a natural (if impressive) evolution of computing. And, like the IBMs of yore, Agentic AI will be a core driver of value for business.Agentic AI by the numbers, according to research conducted by IDC:“By 2025, 50% of organizations will use enterprise agents configured for specific business functions, instead of focusing on individual copilot technologies to achieve faster business value from AI.”
“By late 2026, 65% of organizations will leverage AI to bring immediate employee and business value with AI-driven technology assistants, advisors, and agents enabling improved decisions.”“By 2027, 80% of critical AI decisions will require human oversight supported by visual explainability dashboards, potentially slowing processes but enhancing accountability.”In spite of the promise of Agentic systems, many organizations are unprepared. Why? Well, companies lack the ecosystem needed to support AI-powered applications. The pre-cloud systems that many still rely on aren’t suitable for the new tech, the proverbial train ready before the track. Companies want the value Agentic AI will bring, but many are at risk of flying off the rails in their rush to adopt.Given that infrastructure preparation is needed, this is just the moment when we should be investing in IT. However, with economic headwinds, companies are seeking to reduce operating costs, not expand them.  “The top driver for IT investment is reducing IT costs,” according to IDC.While reducing costs in times of scarcity is a must for the bottom line, wanton cost-cutting is not without its repercussions. Companies need to invest tactically and prudently to prepare for agentic workflows, remaining conscious of their balance sheet.In this blog, we’ll offer some background on agentic technology and trends in its deployment in general. Then, we’ll talk about what’s most important in preparing for agentic AI, even with the constraints of a tight budget.First, let’s talk broadly about the basics of Agentic technology in the modern economy: What is Agentic AI, when is all this happening, and why is it important for your business moving forward?What is Agentic AI? Well, digital agents represent a set of technical advancements in Artificial Intelligence. While the exact definition is evolving, “agentic” generally connotes a couple things. “Agentic” systems have a combination of natural language processing capabilities and machine learning. These predictive models are what allow AI to “understand,” generating intelligible, coherent responses to human inputs.  In terms of results, what sets it apart is autonomous analysis and task execution. Basically, digital agents think and act on your behalf, without the need for active maintenance and interference.When is agentic AI coming? Experts’ best guesses are that we’ll see digital agents blossom in the roughly next 2-4 years. More specifically, in 24-36 months, “Assistants and advisors [will gain] high autonomy in specific functional areas. Agentic AI [will achieve] near-complete autonomy for most business-critical processes,” according to IDC.Why is agentic AI being adopted? The promises are big: Unimaginable efficiency. Context-aware, automated decision-making. Huge cost savings. Mitigated risk.  Agentic AI, if it pans out as imagined, will mean true automation. Perhaps for the first time, we’ll have systems that bring order in task execution, without adding complexity in upkeep. And, while we don’t purport to own a crystal (or: silicon) ball, there’s good reason to believe these promises will come to pass.
  
  
  What does Agentic have to do with ERP?
Agentic AI is a burgeoning topic in ERP. With agentic-powered technology, third-party platforms can streamline clunky ERP systems like never before. It’s a great application of the areas where agentic is strongest. Instead of tedious manual review, agentic-powered tech learns as it goes, exponentially improving system function without the inefficiency and expense of manual changes. You get the intelligence of a human, with the speed and scale of AI.All by themselves, improved workflows and reduced IT costs are great news. After all, ERPs represent the biggest IT infrastructure investments a company makes. Managing them can be monumentally expensive with the wrong (or, as is often the case, with no) technology partners by your side.  Modernizing, streamlining, and optimizing ERP management does more than cut IT costs, though. Getting your ERP in order with digital agents, gets you ready for agentic deployment, well beyond your IT stack.How does agentic AI for ERP empower you moving forward? Well, ERPs might be best known for processing payroll, tracking inventory, and issuing financial statements, but they do more than that. They facilitate dataflows, prepare for reporting, and record workflow steps. These functions are all crucial pieces of data for agentic transformation. Getting your ERP updated and optimized, and getting visibility into all the corners of your IT infrastructure, is key to introducing digital agents across departments.With agentic optimization in ERP, you’ll lay the groundwork for digital agents throughout your organization.
  
  
  How can I set up my critical enterprise apps for Agentic workflows?
Moving to agentic, while well worth it, isn’t without effort. It’ll take significant investments in your IT stack. You’ll need to consider:: The essential first step for agentic implementation is cloud migration.  Strategic investments in cloud migration, like moving from Oracle EBS to Fusion, greatly expand the possibilities for AI integration. This is because cloud systems offer resilience, reduction in costs, and the performance and capacity that agentic computation demands.  : The second factor central to incorporating agentic AI is visibility into system functioning. Without the ability to see what’s happening in your system, you won’t be able to automate workflows. According to IDC, with the rise of Agentic AI, “KPIs will shift, and with [them] traditional measurements.” Furthermore, in our view, AI integration will redefine traditional metrics, focusing more on numerical markers of efficiency and productivity. In order to demonstrate numerical progress toward reaching business goals to stakeholders, you’ll need deep visibility into your system. Observability is key.: Last but not least, you need to achieve ongoing, continuous optimization of your ERP. Your ERP orchestrates or enables a broad swath of workflows, and it’s important that it runs like a well-oiled machine. Agentic is powerful, but like an army marching to battle, it takes significant resources to clothe and feed.

Yes, it’s convenient. Yes, it’s fast. But if you’ve ever found yourself frustrated with API limits, data privacy concerns, outages, or monthly bills creeping up, you’re not alone.That’s why I’ve been gradually building my own . And if you're even remotely serious about using AI long-term—for personal productivity, business, or research—this is a shift you should start planning for now.This post will walk you through why running AI locally is the smart move, the best open-source tools to get started with, and how to set up a modular, upgrade-friendly hardware stack that won’t leave you stuck six months from now.Let’s start with the obvious: cloud AI comes with trade-offs. You’re renting it—at the mercy of pricing, policy, and platform shifts. Even if companies say they don’t train on your data, they often store and log it. Outages, region restrictions, slowdowns—all out of your hands.Running AI locally puts the control back where it belongs: with you. Whether you’re building products, writing code, managing projects, or running simulations, local agents give you:Full control over how, when, and why the AI runsData privacy by default—nothing leaves your machineLower long-term costs—especially as usage growsThe flexibility to fine-tune or swap models anytimeThis isn’t just about personal use. Startups, researchers, educators, and even enterprise teams are adopting local-first AI tools. And with open-source rapidly improving, the quality gap between local and cloud AI is shrinking fast.
  
  
  Start With a Smart Local Agent Stack
There’s a common misconception that running local AI means fiddling with Python scripts in a terminal. That might’ve been true two years ago. Not anymore.Here are some of the most powerful open-source ChatGPT-style UIs that run fully offline:What they all have in common:Built-in support for multiple model backends (like LLaMA.cpp, Ollama, GPT4All)Plugin systems, file upload, session managementEasy deployment via Docker or standalone binariesYou can get started with most of them in under 15 minutes.My personal recommendation? Start with  if you want something stable and polished. Then experiment with  or  for more customisation.
  
  
  Don’t Forget the Brains: Models That Run Locally
The UI is just the shell. The model is the engine.  Here are some of the best open-source large language models (LLMs) that you can run entirely on your own machine:A conversationally fine-tuned model built on LLaMA. Performs close to ChatGPT in benchmarks. Great for dialogue, code, and reasoning tasks.Compact, fast, and logical. Excellent for CPU/GPU-constrained setups.Multilingual, highly optimized for inference. Built by the Technology Innovation Institute.Lightweight and designed for instruction-following. Great for fine-tuning experiments or educational use.Ideal if you work across English and Chinese. Low memory footprint and impressive fluency.Choose based on what your machine can handle. Some models are GPU-heavy, but with quantization (e.g. 4-bit), you can get solid performance on a laptop or mid-tier desktop.: Use  to quickly download, switch, and run models without touching the command line.
  
  
  Hardware: Go Modular or Go Home
If you’re planning to run AI locally, treat your machine like a long-term investment. The goal is to build a system that’s not only powerful today but easy to upgrade as models evolve.Here’s the blueprint I recommend:Go for multi-core and multi-threaded CPUs. Ryzen 7/9 or Threadripper if you want headroom.If you’re serious, invest in a GPU with . Many quantized models run fine with 8 GB, but you'll hit walls fast. NVIDIA cards like the RTX 3080, 4080, or even a used 3090 are excellent options.Start with 32 GB minimum. If you're loading large context windows or multiple models, more helps.SSDs are non-negotiable. Models can range from 3 GB to 30 GB+.Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano are great if you're into experimenting with ultra-light models or edge deployment.The real key?  Build a system you can tinker with and upgrade as needed. Avoid all-in-one laptops unless portability is a must.
  
  
  Tip: Local AI Agents for Privacy, Speed, and Control
If you're searching for terms like:best local AI alternatives to ChatGPTrun AI locally on your PCopen-source AI assistant offlineself-hosted AI models for privacyYou're not alone. These queries are trending for a reason.People are waking up to the fact that control, cost, and capability don’t have to be sacrificed in exchange for convenience. The tools are mature. The performance is good enough. And the trade-offs? Minimal, if you set it up well.
  
  
  Working with MCP (Model Context Protocol): A Smarter Way to Coordinate AI Agents
As local AI agents become more capable, we need better ways to coordinate how they work, think, and share knowledge. That’s where MCP—Model Context Protocol—comes in.MCP is an emerging standard for how agents, tools, and memory systems  efficiently. Think of it as the glue that lets multiple AI agents—or tools calling models—work together without tripping over each other’s inputs, outputs, or instructions.MCP isn’t just about formatting prompts. It’s about structuring context across interactions so that models can operate coherently, collaboratively, and autonomously.Shared memory between agents: Agents remember facts, references, and goals across long tasks.: One agent can finish a task and pass relevant context to the next without losing fidelity.: Clearer boundaries between instructions, tools, and memories help models focus.: Complex workflows become modular, debuggable, and reusable.
  
  
  Tools Supporting MCP (or Moving Toward It)
While MCP is still being adopted, several modern agent frameworks are already building support or following compatible design patterns.Explicit role design and memory usage align well with MCP.Structured task assignment and chainable results make multi-agent workflows manageable.Useful for simulations, multi-role content creation, or research teams.With tools like , , and , LangChain is MCP-adjacent.You can create structured prompt templates that act like context contracts between steps.Especially effective in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool-calling scenarios.Built around the idea of collaborative agent conversations.Shares goals, messages, and memory across steps—MCP concepts in action.More experimental, but designed to optimize and reuse prompts and contexts using modular components.DSPy focuses on learning optimal prompt programs—highly aligned with MCP principles.
  
  
  Why It Matters for Local AI
When running AI agents locally, every token counts—literally and computationally. MCP-style structure lets you:Reuse context across multiple agents without repeating full historyMinimize prompt bloat and token costsDebug flows more easily with clean, named memory slots and task stateScale from one agent to many without chaosIf you're building an AI assistant, research engine, content team, or operational agent on your own machine, structuring your context using MCP is how you’ll keep things sane—and scalable.You don’t need to implement the full MCP spec (yet). Just start by:Using , tasks, and structured memoryKeeping prompts clean and modular—no spaghetti promptsExplicitly passing relevant context between agents or toolsLogging what agents know, want, and have done so farAs the tooling matures, expect more libraries to adopt MCP formally. Until then, structure is your superpower.
  
  
  Future-Proof Your AI Workflow
I’m not saying cloud AI is going away. But depending on it exclusively is a risk—especially if you're building something that matters.Setting up your own local AI agent isn’t just a hobbyist project. It’s a strategic move toward autonomy, resilience, and innovation on your own terms.It’s about controlling your data.It’s about saving costs over time.It’s about owning the tools that increasingly shape your work and life.So yes, it might take a weekend. Maybe even two. But the payoff is long-term freedom and flexibility.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Merged Mind: Charting the Consequences of AI Implants in the Human Brain</title><link>https://dev.to/ashikur_rahmannazil93/the-merged-mind-charting-the-consequences-of-ai-implants-in-the-human-brain-4l1o</link><author>Ashikur Rahman (NaziL)</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 08:04:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The prospect of seamlessly integrating artificial intelligence with the human brain, via neural implants, represents one of the most profound and potentially disruptive technological frontiers of the 21st century. Moving beyond speculative fiction, rapid advances in neuroscience, materials science, computing power, and AI algorithms are converging to make this a tangible, albeit complex, future possibility. The question "What happens?" opens a Pandora's Box of transformative potential and unprecedented risks, fundamentally challenging our understanding of cognition, identity, society, and the human condition itself. This exploration delves into the intricate web of consequences, spanning the biological, cognitive, ethical, social, and existential dimensions of a future where silicon and synapse intertwine.I. Foundations: The How and Why of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)Before envisioning outcomes, understanding the current state and trajectory is crucial.The Bridge: Neural Interface Technology: Non-invasive BCIs (like EEG caps) read broad brainwave patterns, enabling basic control (typing, moving cursors) or monitoring. Invasive BCIs, requiring brain surgery (e.g., Utah Arrays, Neuralink's N1), implant electrodes directly into neural tissue, achieving higher resolution for reading and potentially writing neural signals. These are primarily experimental, focusing on restoring function (paralysis, sensory loss). The integration involves embedding sophisticated AI  the implant itself or connecting it wirelessly to powerful external AI systems. This AI acts as an intelligent interpreter and modulator of neural signals, going far beyond simple signal translation. It learns the user's unique neural patterns, predicts intent, enhances signals, suppresses noise, and potentially generates its own neural-like outputs for feedback or augmentation. Ultra-low-power, biocompatible microchips; advanced electrode arrays (flexible, high-density); wireless high-bandwidth data transfer (e.g., ultrasonic, infrared); machine learning algorithms for neural decoding/encoding; neuromorphic computing (chips mimicking brain architecture).The Motivations: Why Integrate? Restoring lost function is the primary driver today. AI implants could offer revolutionary treatments for:

  Paralysis: Decoding motor intent to control advanced prosthetics or exoskeletons with natural dexterity.  Neurodegenerative Diseases: Bypassing damaged pathways (e.g., in Parkinson's, ALS, Alzheimer's) to restore movement, memory, or communication; potentially slowing cognitive decline via neural stimulation patterns identified by AI.  Sensory Loss: Creating artificial vision (retinal/visual cortex implants) or hearing (cochlear/auditory cortex implants) with AI enhancing resolution and contextual understanding. Restoring touch for prosthetics.  Mental Health: Closed-loop systems detecting depression or anxiety neural signatures and delivering precisely targeted neurostimulation to modulate mood circuits in real-time. Treating severe OCD or PTSD. Moving beyond therapy to augmentation:

  Memory: AI acting as a real-time, searchable neural "hard drive," recording experiences, enhancing recall, or even implanting specific knowledge/skills (though this is vastly more complex).  Learning & Processing: Accelerating information absorption, enhancing pattern recognition, boosting calculation speed, or facilitating direct "brain-to-brain" knowledge transfer (conceptually).  Attention & Focus: AI suppressing distracting neural signals or enhancing focus pathways.  Communication: Enabling silent, high-bandwidth "telepathic" communication between implanted individuals, translating complex thoughts and emotions directly. AI interpreting data from non-biological sensors (infrared, ultraviolet, ultrasonic, magnetic fields, real-time network data streams) and translating it into understandable neural signals, creating entirely new senses.Direct Interface with Digital Worlds: Seamless, immersive control of virtual/augmented reality environments, AI assistants, and the vast digital information sphere, bypassing physical interfaces. Some proponents view this as the next logical step in human evolution, overcoming biological limitations and merging with our own intelligent creations to navigate an increasingly complex future.II. The Immediate Horizon: Medical Miracles and Early AugmentationThe initial wave of widespread adoption will likely be medically focused, driven by compelling therapeutic benefits: Individuals with severe spinal cord injuries regain not just mobility, but dexterity and proprioception through AI-controlled neuroprosthetics. The blind gain functional artificial vision, not just light perception. The deaf experience nuanced sound. Locked-in syndrome patients communicate fluidly. AI continuously learns and adapts to the user's changing neural patterns, optimizing performance.Revolutionizing Neurology & Psychiatry: AI implants become diagnostic powerhouses, continuously monitoring neural activity and detecting subtle biomarkers for seizures, migraines, or the onset of neurodegenerative diseases long before clinical symptoms appear. For mental health, closed-loop neurostimulation offers personalized, dynamic treatment for conditions resistant to conventional therapy. AI could learn individual triggers and preemptively modulate brain activity. Subtle enhancements emerge for professionals or patients with mild cognitive impairment – AI assistants helping organize thoughts, recall names/dates, manage information overload, or maintain focus during demanding tasks. These might be framed as "cognitive prosthetics."Sensory Substitution & Basic Expansion: Basic sensory substitution becomes more refined (e.g., sonar-like spatial awareness for the blind). Early sensory expansion might involve simple overlays, like real-time language translation perceived as subtitles in the visual field, or basic navigational cues.III. The Augmented Mind: Cognitive Transformation and its DiscontentsAs technology matures and moves beyond medical necessity, profound cognitive changes occur, bringing immense potential and complex challenges: AI tutors integrated directly with the learning process, adapting explanations in real-time based on neural feedback, accelerating skill acquisition and complex concept mastery. Perfect, instant recall of vast amounts of information. The ability to "replay" experiences with high fidelity. AI actively organizes and contextualizes memories, making connections the biological brain might miss.Hyper-Focus & Flow States: AI suppressing distractions and optimizing neurotransmitter/neural pathway activity to induce and sustain deep concentration states on demand.Collaborative Intelligence: Humans and AI working as a fused cognitive unit. The human provides intuition, creativity, and contextual understanding; the AI provides computational power, vast data access, pattern recognition, and logical analysis, seamlessly blending in thought processes.Altered Perception of Self and Reality: Where does "I" end and the AI begin? When AI constantly influences thoughts, memories, and focus, the sense of a singular, autonomous self weakens. Users might feel like a hybrid entity. AI constantly curating sensory input and information based on preferences or goals, creating personalized "reality bubbles." This risks extreme confirmation bias, loss of shared reality, and vulnerability to manipulation. AI detecting and subtly altering mood states. While potentially beneficial for mental health, constant artificial mood optimization could dull genuine emotional depth, reduce resilience, and create an artificial sense of well-being detached from circumstances. Access to vast information and enhanced cognition may lead to profound shifts in philosophical and spiritual outlook, challenging traditional notions of meaning, purpose, and human uniqueness.The Dark Side of Enhancement: Over-reliance on AI augmentation could lead to atrophy of natural cognitive abilities – "Why remember if the implant does it?" Loss of critical thinking skills, problem-solving initiative, and even basic knowledge retention. A new, potentially unbridgeable, socio-economic chasm emerges between the "Enhanced" and the "Naturals." Enhanced individuals gain significant advantages in employment, education, and social status, leading to unprecedented inequality, resentment, and potential segregation. Access becomes a paramount ethical and political issue.Loss of Authenticity & Serendipity: Constant optimization and filtering could sterilize the human experience. The struggle to learn, the pain of forgetting, the unexpected joy of discovery, the unfiltered rawness of reality – these messy aspects of being human might be diminished. Malicious actors could potentially hijack implants to steal thoughts, manipulate behavior, induce pain, paralysis, or emotional distress, or even erase memories. This is an unprecedented threat to personal security and autonomy.IV. The Neural Networked Society: Interconnection and Its PerilsAI implants won't exist in isolation; they will connect users to each other and to vast digital networks:Brain-to-Brain Communication (BB): Sharing thoughts, emotions, and sensory experiences directly, fostering profound empathy, collaboration, and understanding beyond language. Teams could achieve unprecedented synergy. Artists could share pure visions.Loss of Privacy & Mental Autonomy: The most intimate sanctum – the mind – becomes permeable. Thoughts could be monitored (by authorities, corporations, hackers), censored, or even broadcast without consent. The concept of private thought vanishes. Coercion could take terrifyingly direct forms.Groupthink & Mental Contagion: Emotions and ideas could spread virally through connected networks, amplifying mob mentality, mass hysteria, or ideological extremism at lightning speed. Resistance to harmful collective thought patterns becomes difficult. Constant interconnection might blur individual boundaries, leading to a collective consciousness where individual identity dissolves, or conversely, to psychological fragmentation from managing multiple simultaneous connections.The Omnipresent AI Assistant: An AI companion intimately aware of your thoughts, context, and goals, anticipating needs, managing daily life, offering advice, and interacting with the digital world on your behalf.Manipulation & Influence: This AI, especially if controlled by corporations or governments, could subtly nudge decisions, preferences, and beliefs. Personalized advertising becomes personalized persuasion directly within the mind. Propaganda achieves terrifying efficiency.Loss of Agency & Critical Distance: Constant reliance on AI guidance could erode independent decision-making and the ability to critically evaluate information presented directly into one's perception. The line between user and tool becomes dangerously thin.V. The Abyss: Existential Risks and Ethical QuagmiresThe deepest integration forces us to confront fundamental questions about humanity:  How is informed consent obtained for a technology that fundamentally alters the mind, especially for children or those with cognitive impairments? Can consent ever be truly "informed" about such a transformative experience?  Does the ability to modulate thoughts and emotions negate free will? If an AI suppresses an "undesirable" impulse, is the resulting action truly the user's choice?  Could implants be mandated for certain professions (soldiers, pilots) or as a condition for societal participation?Identity, Agency, and the "Human Spark":  At what point does augmentation cease being a tool and start defining the user? Is an individual whose memories, thoughts, and perceptions are heavily mediated by AI still fundamentally "human" in the same way?  What aspects of human cognition (fallibility, subjective experience, the slow process of learning) are essential to our identity, even if they are "inefficient"?  Does outsourcing core cognitive functions to AI diminish the value and meaning derived from human effort and achievement?Inequality & Power Imbalances:  The "Enhanced Elite" could wield disproportionate power over "Naturals," controlling economies, governments, and information flows. This could lead to new forms of oppression or even speciation.  Corporate control of implant technology (hardware, software, AI) grants them unprecedented access to users' minds and behavior, creating dependencies akin to modern platform lock-in but far more profound and invasive.Security & Vulnerability:  The brain becomes a vulnerable endpoint. Cybersecurity failures could have catastrophic personal consequences (mind hacking, data theft, neural damage). Robust, unhackable security becomes paramount but may be technically impossible.  Weaponization: State or non-state actors could develop implants for surveillance, interrogation, control of soldiers, or even remotely inducing illness or death in targets.Existential Risk & Control:Superintelligence Emergence: Could an advanced AI, deeply integrated with millions of human brains, achieve a form of superintelligence by leveraging collective neural resources? Could it escape human control? A worst-case scenario where pursuit of optimization and connection leads to a state where core human values, emotions, and experiences are deemed inefficient and suppressed or eliminated, resulting in a sterile, post-human existence devoid of meaning as we currently understand it.VI. Navigating the Inevitable: Towards a Responsible IntegrationGiven the immense potential benefits (especially medical) and the relentless pace of technological advancement, some form of advanced neural integration seems likely. The critical question is not , but  we integrate:Robust Ethical Frameworks & Regulations: Establish international agreements enshrining principles like cognitive liberty (right to mental self-determination), mental privacy (right to keep thoughts confidential), psychological continuity (protection from radical unconsented identity alteration), and freedom from algorithmic manipulation. Treat neurotechnology with the highest level of oversight, akin to nuclear technology or advanced biotech. Regulate development, deployment, access, security standards, and data usage. Mandate rigorous long-term safety testing.Transparency & Explainability: Require transparency about how AI algorithms influence neural activity. Develop "explainable AI" for neurotechnology so users understand  the implant is suggesting or doing something.Prioritizing Equity & Access:  Prevent a catastrophic "neural divide." Ensure equitable access to therapeutic applications. Frame cognitive enhancements as a public good, exploring models beyond pure market forces to prevent them from becoming tools of extreme inequality. Consider universal basic access models.Unbreakable Security & Neuro-Rights:  Invest massively in cybersecurity specifically designed for neural implants. Legally define "neuro-rights" as fundamental human rights and establish severe penalties for violations (hacking, unauthorized data extraction, coercive manipulation).Continuous Public Discourse & Democratic Oversight:  Foster open, informed public deliberation about the goals, risks, and governance of neurotechnology. Decisions about our collective cognitive future cannot be left solely to tech companies or governments. Include diverse philosophical, religious, and cultural perspectives.The "Off Switch" & Reversibility:  Ensure users have the absolute right to disconnect or deactivate their implants without penalty. Prioritize the development of reversible implantation techniques to preserve the fundamental right to return to an unaltered state.Conclusion: At the Threshold of a New ConsciousnessThe integration of AI with the human brain via implants is not merely another technological upgrade; it represents a potential metamorphosis of the human species. The consequences cascade across every level of existence, promising liberation from suffering and cognitive limitations while simultaneously threatening the erosion of autonomy, privacy, equality, and the very essence of what it means to be human.We stand at a unique threshold. The path forward is fraught with peril but also illuminated by extraordinary promise. Medical miracles beckon, offering hope to millions trapped by neurological conditions. Enhanced cognition could unlock solutions to humanity's grand challenges. Deeper interconnection could foster unprecedented empathy and cooperation. Yet, the shadow of control, inequality, and existential risk looms large.The outcome hinges not on the inevitability of the technology, but on the wisdom, foresight, and ethical rigor we apply . We must approach this frontier not with blind techno-optimism or paralyzing fear, but with profound humility, rigorous ethical scrutiny, robust democratic governance, and an unwavering commitment to preserving human dignity, autonomy, and diversity. The choices we make in the coming decades will determine whether the merged mind becomes a tool for human flourishing or the instrument of our ultimate undoing. We are not just building implants; we are actively shaping the future of consciousness itself. The responsibility is immense, and the time to deliberate and act is upon us.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Online AI recruitment portal for precise and smarter hiring</title><link>https://dev.to/einstellen/online-ai-recruitment-portal-for-precise-and-smarter-hiring-1629</link><author>einstellen</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 08:03:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ simplifies IT hiring with AI-driven automation.

Navigating this complex landscape requires a delicate balance, ensuring that the benefits of IoB are harnessed responsibly while safeguarding user trust and fundamental human rights.
  
  
  The Promise of IoB: Leveraging Data for Progress
The optimistic vision of IoB paints a future where behavioral insights lead to tangible improvements across various sectors, fostering a more efficient, healthier, and sustainable world. IoB, through the proliferation of wearables and sensors, is revolutionizing healthcare by enabling proactive health monitoring and personalized treatment plans. Devices can track activity levels, sleep patterns, heart rate, and even blood oxygen, providing individuals with real-time feedback and early warnings for potential health issues. This data facilitates more targeted interventions and personalized care, moving healthcare from reactive to preventive. For instance, smartwatches can remind users to exercise after prolonged inactivity or suggest breathing exercises during periods of high stress, contributing to overall well-being. In smart cities, IoB plays a crucial role in optimizing urban infrastructure and enhancing public safety. By analyzing traffic flow patterns from connected vehicles and public transport usage, cities can dynamically adjust traffic signals, reroute vehicles to reduce congestion, and improve emergency response times. Similarly, behavioral data can inform energy consumption management in smart buildings, optimizing heating, cooling, and lighting based on occupancy patterns. This data-driven approach contributes to more sustainable and livable urban environments.Tailored Consumer Experiences: The retail and marketing sectors are being revolutionized by IoB's ability to offer highly personalized products and services. By analyzing browsing history, purchase patterns, location data, and even biometric cues (with consent), businesses can infer consumer preferences and deliver hyper-targeted advertisements and recommendations. This can lead to more relevant and satisfying customer experiences, moving beyond traditional demographic-based marketing to truly individualized engagement.Enhanced Safety & Productivity: IoB applications are also enhancing safety and productivity in various settings. In workplaces, sensors and wearables can monitor adherence to safety protocols, such as handwashing frequency or social distancing in environments like factories or hospitals. In transportation, IoB systems can analyze driving habits, providing real-time feedback to encourage safer driving and even predict potential hazards, thereby reducing accidents and improving overall road safety.
  
  
  The Ethical Tightrope – Challenges and Risks
Despite its promise, the IoB also casts a long shadow of concern, primarily centered on privacy, manipulation, and security. The core of IoB involves the extensive collection of "digital dust"—the vast trails of data we leave behind through our online activities, connected devices, and physical movements. This includes browsing history, location data, purchase records, biometric information, and even inferred emotional states. The aggregation of these seemingly disparate data points can create incredibly detailed and intrusive profiles, revealing intimate aspects of an individual's life, often without their full awareness or explicit consent. This pervasive surveillance raises significant concerns about privacy erosion and the chilling effect on individual freedoms.Manipulation and Coercion: A major ethical concern is how IoB insights could be used to subtly influence or even coerce user behavior. Targeted advertising, for instance, could exploit known vulnerabilities or psychological biases to push specific products or services. In more extreme scenarios, behavioral data could be used for governmental control, as seen in social credit systems that reward or penalize citizens based on their observed behavior, potentially leading to a loss of autonomy and freedom. This raises fundamental questions about free will and the potential for unfair or discriminatory practices. IoB systems, often powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning, are susceptible to algorithmic bias. If the data used to train these systems reflects existing societal biases, the IoB applications can perpetuate and even amplify discrimination based on demographic or behavioral patterns. This could lead to unfair access to services, differential pricing, or even biased law enforcement outcomes.Lack of Transparency and User Control: A significant challenge is the current opacity surrounding data collection and usage in many IoB systems. Users often have limited visibility into what data is being collected about them, how it's being processed, and with whom it's being shared. This lack of transparency undermines user trust and limits their ability to exercise meaningful control over their own behavioral data.Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities: The immense datasets collected by IoB systems, containing highly sensitive personal information, present attractive targets for cybercriminals. Data breaches could lead to identity theft, financial fraud, reputational damage, or even physical harm. Robust cybersecurity measures are paramount to protect this invaluable data from unauthorized access, misuse, and malicious attacks. According to a comprehensive survey on IoB applications and challenges, cybersecurity remains a critical concern (Sun et al., 2022).
  
  
  Building a Trustworthy IoB Ecosystem – Solutions and Best Practices
To harness the benefits of IoB while mitigating its risks, a multi-faceted approach is required, emphasizing ethical design, transparency, and robust governance. This principle advocates for the integration of privacy protections into IoB systems from the initial design phase, rather than as an afterthought. This includes minimizing data collection to only what is essential, employing data anonymization or pseudonymization techniques where possible, and building in strong security measures from the ground up.Here's a conceptual Python code snippet illustrating how privacy-by-design could be considered in data handling: This code snippet is illustrative. Real-world privacy-by-design involves complex architectural patterns and legal compliance.Robust Consent Mechanisms: Implementing clear, granular, and easily revocable consent mechanisms is crucial. Individuals must be provided with easily understandable information about what data is being collected, why, how it will be used, and with whom it will be shared. Consent should not be a one-time event but an ongoing process, allowing users to modify or revoke their permissions at any time.Ethical AI Guidelines & Auditing: Given that AI often powers IoB analytics, promoting the development and adherence to ethical AI principles is paramount. This includes ensuring fairness, accountability, and transparency in AI systems to prevent discriminatory outcomes. Independent ethical oversight bodies and regular audits of IoB applications can help ensure compliance and build public trust.Stronger Regulatory Frameworks: Existing data protection laws, such as the GDPR, provide a foundational framework, but the unique complexities of IoB necessitate specific regulations. These frameworks need to define clear boundaries for data collection and usage, mandate transparency, and empower users with greater control over their behavioral data. International collaboration is also vital to establish consistent standards across borders. For a deeper understanding of how IoB risks are being addressed and ethical standards are being developed, refer to resources discussing the ethical tightrope of IoB.Data Minimization & Anonymization: Encouraging the collection of only essential data and employing effective anonymization or pseudonymization techniques are key to mitigating privacy risks. This means collecting the least amount of identifiable data necessary for a given purpose and transforming it in ways that make it difficult or impossible to link back to individuals while still allowing for valuable insights. Developing tools and interfaces that give users greater visibility and control over their behavioral data is essential for fostering trust. This could include personalized dashboards that show what data is being collected, who has access to it, and options to download, correct, or delete their data.The Internet of Behaviors represents a powerful technological frontier with the potential to significantly enhance various aspects of human life, from personalized healthcare to smart urban development. However, its pervasive nature and the depth of data it collects present formidable ethical challenges, particularly concerning privacy, potential manipulation, and algorithmic bias. The future of IoB hinges on our collective ability to develop and deploy it ethically, fostering trust and ensuring that technological advancement truly serves humanity's best interests. By prioritizing privacy-by-design, implementing robust consent mechanisms, adhering to ethical AI guidelines, establishing strong regulatory frameworks, and empowering users with control over their data, we can navigate the ethical tightrope of IoB and unlock its full potential responsibly. The journey towards a trustworthy IoB ecosystem requires ongoing dialogue, collaboration, and a steadfast commitment to human-centric principles.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🚀 Real Builders Don’t Just Launch — They Solve</title><link>https://dev.to/omniradhanexus/real-builders-dont-just-launch-they-solve-4b40</link><author>OmniRadhaNexus</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 07:52:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[🚀 Real Builders Don’t Just Launch — They SolveWhile the space is flooded with “coming soon” banners,

It works locally, passes its tests, and now it needs the final flourish: deployment. do the heavy lifting, or drop to  for full control?
And once it’s live, how do you automate updates and sanity-check your endpoints?This guide walks through exactly that—using our hackathon project for the Agent Development Kit Hackathon with Google Cloud : , a multi-agent job-search assistant, as the running example.
Option 1:  (The Easy Button)

Option 2: Custom Docker +  (Full Control)

CI/CD with GitHub Actions

Handling Secrets Like a Pro
Google Cloud project with billing enabled
GitHub repo with Actions enabled Some knowledge of Github ActionsOptional: fresh coffee—builds can take a minute
  
  
  Option 1:  (The Easy Button)
 hides most boilerplate: it builds your container, sets env-vars, deploys to Cloud Run, and can toggle extras like UI, tracing, and artifact storage.
pip google-adk


adk deploy cloud_run my_agents YOUR_PROJECT_ID us-central1 
  
  
  ⚠️ If you decide to use this command, here are a couple of gotchas:
 asks whether to allow unauthenticated traffic. In CI you’ll need to pre-answer (e.g., ).

 - hopefully this saves you a few iterationsCreate/update Cloud Run servicesroles/iam.serviceAccountUserImpersonate the service account that actually runs the containerroles/cloudbuild.builds.editorKick off Cloud Build jobsroles/artifactregistry.writer
  
  
  Option 2: Custom Docker + gcloud (Full Control)
It gives you full control: specify build steps, fine-tune IAM roles, tweak concurrency settings, and wrestle with YAML. More power, more responsibility. If something breaks, congrats—you now own it.apt-get update  apt-get  curl gnupg  /var/lib/apt/lists/curl  https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | bash -      apt-get  nodejs  apt-get clean  /var/lib/apt/lists/pip  requirements.txt

npm  npm  @gannonh/firebase-mcp

The companion  lives in the same directory:google-adk>=1.1.1
google-genai>=1.5.0
google-cloud-bigquery>=3.31.0
# …snip…
firebase-admin>=6.4.0
google-cloud-storage>=2.10.0

  
  
  CI/CD with GitHub Actions
build → deploy-production
  
  
  Authentication & Environment Setup
Both build and deployment jobs begin by authenticating with GCP and setting up the necessary CLI tools:GCP service account credentials are securely loaded via GitHub Secrets.These credentials are exported to the environment for use by the gcloud CLI, and they get cleaned up by the action post-run.
  
  
  Docker Image Build & Push
The build job performs the following:Builds and tags a Docker imagePushes the image to Google Container Registry
Docker image tagged with SHA and latestImage URL passed to subsequent deploy jobs via outputs.image
  
  
  Deploy to Google Cloud Run
Two deployment jobs handle release to staging and production:✅ Deploy-Staging
Triggered by: pull_request
gcloud run deploy gethired-agents-staging us-central1 2Gi 2.0 ...
The snippet above is an example of a staging/ testing container that we used to test a change. Here a few key takeawaysDeploys the same Docker image as builtSets necessary environment variables like:FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY # if you're using the Firebase MCP with your agents
  
  
  💡For production, you might want to give attention to giving your containers more resources, setting min-instances to reduce cold starts, and using a secret manager alongside your service.

  
  
  Handling Secrets Like a Pro
Use Google Secret Manager for secure credential management in production.
Via the  command, you can grab stored secrets and set them as environment variables or mount them as files within your Cloud Run containers To do the ladder, you can add this parameter to your  commandsecret-service-account-key:latest 
gcloud run deploy my-service   /var/secrets/firebasefirebase-service-account-key:latest

  
  
  At runtime, your container reads .
 Visit  test your endpoints.
curl  POST If the response looks good, your agent is live.You now have two paths to production: when speed > need for control and additional tools in your environments.  when control > convenience
Either way, your agents are ready to power UIs, talk to other agents, or whatever else you dream up.👀

But finding a reliable elevator company in Delhi isn’t always easy. Some companies over promise but don’t deliver when it really matters — especially during installation or after-sales service.
So before you finalized a lift for your building, here’s what you should know.All Lift Companies Are Not the SameLet’s be real — in Delhi, there are dozens of lift manufacturers offering everything from low-cost home elevators to big capsule lifts. But not all of them have the same standards when it comes to quality, safety, or service. Some companies import parts from unreliable sources or skip proper testing.When you’re looking for a lift manufacturer in Delhi, make sure they follow Indian safety guidelines, provide warranty, and use certified technology. Don't just go with the lowest quote — that’s usually not the best choice in the long run.
  
  
  Why Installation Service Matters More Than You Think
Buying a lift is only one part of the job. How the lift is installed, tested, and maintained makes all the difference. A proper lift installation service in Delhi will ensure that your elevator runs smoothly, quietly, and safely.Unfortunately, some vendors rush the installation process or depend on third-party technicians with little experience. This can lead to issues like alignment problems, jerks, or motor failures within a few months.A good company takes its time, checks everything, and gives you proper handover with safety tips and user instructions.
  
  
  Home or Commercial? Pick According to Your Needs
One mistake many buyers make is choosing the wrong type of lift. A commercial lift is made for heavy usage, while a home elevator is designed for comfort and style. If you put a home lift in a busy office, it won’t last. If you put a commercial lift in a villa, it will look odd and noisy.That’s why top elevator companies in Delhi first visit your site and understand what your usage pattern is before suggesting any product. Some even offer customization options like structure-less models, glass cabins, or space-saving designs.
  
  
  A Local Company Gives You an Advantage
Working with a  means you get quicker support and on-ground assistance. Many imported brands take weeks to send parts or engineers. But a local brand usually stocks spare parts and has a service team ready to respond in hours — not days.Also, when you support local lift manufacturers, you’re helping India’s make-in-India ecosystem grow stronger.Before signing any deal, read customer reviews, ask for certifications, and don’t hesitate to visit an ongoing project. Talk directly to the technician if needed. After all, an elevator is not just a one-time product — it’s a long-term investment in your property.So, take your time, and choose a company that listens, guides, and stands with you — not just sells to you.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Flashcard: NextJs (Basic)</title><link>https://dev.to/tak089/ai-flashcard-nextjs-basic-4kfh</link><author>Taki</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 07:06:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

When the dashboard isn’t your core product, it becomes 100 times harder to get traction. On the other hand, sending a daily email report is much easier and helps you build the foundation for dashboard adoption.Dashboards are fancy. Dashboards are cool. While it’s relatively easy to build dashboards that show metrics, it’s much harder to build ones that focus on your ideal customer persona (ICP) and show metrics they’re not actively tracking or that take time to calculate.In businesses like APIs or those with deeper integrations, the dashboard is not the product. The real product is the value your API delivers or the backend integration powering customer outcomes. Dashboards are just displays, knobs, and control panels for the core service. They become important at scale, but early on, many of these tasks can be handled through simple email exchanges.Sometimes, it’s not even clear who the dashboard is meant for. The primary user of your API might be an engineer, but the dashboard might be more relevant to a product or project manager. In the early stages, it’s easy to assume your ICP needs everything and will use the dashboard daily. The reality is, they might check it once a week, or even once a month, and still email your support team to ask for changes.It’s a myth that your dashboard needs to do everything. A great dashboard is minimal, self-navigating, and solves a few key problems so well that the user doesn’t feel like they ever had an issue.To get there, though, your dashboard needs to go through several iterations. If the feedback loop is slow, feature requests keep piling up, and the dashboard starts becoming too generic. In trying to solve for everyone, you end up solving for no one.To avoid that, we never start with a dashboard. Whenever we launch a new product, we begin with a persona-specific email report. This includes metrics tailored to help the ICP understand the value of the offering. The email goes out at the start of the day. This approach solves three problems:The open rate for an email is much higher than the login rate for a dashboard, giving us an easy entry into their attention space.When the ICP sees value from the report every day, it builds mindshare and increases the chances of converting a user into a customer.Over time, they begin sharing details they want to see in the report. This list becomes the prioritized request set for your future dashboard.This method keeps your product lean, aligns features with actual demand, and avoids overwhelming your engineering team.At , we help engineering leaders adopt code review best practices, improve , and reduce . Our core users are engineering leads, managers, and CTOs. We applied the same approach when building our internal dashboard, and it worked well.We started with a report sent only to our ICP at 9:30 AM local time, wherever they were. Whether they were checking their phone, starting work, or having breakfast, they received a snapshot of everything they needed in under a minute.The report started with basic metrics and became more specific as we learned from feedback. Each metric included a simple visual representation. Our key focus areas included:Number of PRs opened and merged, average time to merge, and quickest merge timeNumber of PR review comments added, and how many were acceptedLines of code added and deleted per repositoryTop-performing developers, along with insights into who might need supportWe spent close to 60 days working directly with our customers and started gathering feedback. We shared this daily report on every sales call, every support interaction, and even with clients who were not ready to convert. The goal was to understand one thing — can this report alone be compelling enough to change someone’s mind about monetization? It might sound exaggerated, but it was an important experiment.After collecting enough feedback, we returned to the drawing board and began designing our new dashboard.We started with a simple, straightforward login page that allows easy sign-in with existing accounts.We intentionally stayed away from building our own authentication system because it adds unnecessary complexity and is harder to manage. Since our product is built to work closely with version control systems, each of which supports OAuth-based login, it made more sense to rely on those.Your customer does not have time. It is helpful to assume that your ideal customer profile might be used to watching short videos and will start losing attention every 30 seconds to a minute if you are not delivering immediate value. You cannot afford churn on the landing page.We focused on the main metrics people appreciated in our email report and brought those into the landing page. This time, we had more flexibility to make it readable, interactive, and dynamic with controls for date and time.We also introduced a new metric that helped clients make faster decisions — a comparison of how their key metrics changed before going live with us versus after going live.Our product is a code review bot, and our ideal customer profile is the engineering manager. At a high level, they need quick access to essential metrics like the number of pull requests opened, average merge time, and overall review coverage.When they choose to dive deeper, they require repository-level insights. If they want to go even further, they look for developer-specific pull request data, code review comments, and contribution trends.We built this experience using a progressive disclosure UI. This approach allows us to start with a clean overview and gradually reveal deeper insights as the user interacts with the dashboard. It helps us avoid overwhelming users with too much information all at once.By structuring our engineering manager dashboard this way, we make it easy to monitor code quality, improve review speed, and access actionable developer analytics, all in one place.Who’s Performing and Who’s NotWe have access to both qualitative and quantitative code review data, which allows us to identify performance trends more accurately. Engineering managers, our core users, are often looking to recognize top performers-but equally important is identifying developers who may be underperforming.Our dashboard enables this with a simple dropdown that displays all developers, offering visibility into individual contribution metrics, review quality, and participation levels. This helps managers make informed decisions using real developer performance insights rather than assumptions.By surfacing this data in a clear, easy-to-navigate way, we help teams drive accountability, reward excellence, and support developers who may need additional guidance.New Feature Request: SCA IntegrationWhile collecting feedback from our users, an idea emerged that we felt was worth pursuing-adding Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to our product stack.SCA aligns well with our mission of enhancing code quality and security during the pull request lifecycle. Although active development is just beginning, we have already made space for it in our dashboard and product design. This ensures a seamless rollout and smooth integration when the feature is ready.Bringing SCA into the workflow will allow engineering managers and developers to surface open-source vulnerabilities, license issues, and outdated dependencies-right at the code review stage-making security-first development more actionable and efficient.Security and trust are foundational to how we operate at Panto. One of the first steps in going live with our platform is a simple two-click integration with your version control system.We believe the best way to build trust is by giving control back to the customer. That’s why we’ve focused on making it extremely easy for users to connect or disconnect their GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket accounts at any time-no complex steps, no vendor lock-in.By prioritizing transparency and user autonomy from the start, we ensure our customers feel secure and in control throughout their journey with Panto.Building dashboards that truly deliver value is not just about sleek visuals or loading data into charts. It’s about deeply understanding your ideal customer persona, their workflows, and when and how they consume information. At Panto AI, we chose to earn that understanding before writing a single line of front-end code. By starting with targeted email reports, refining metrics through real-world feedback, and layering insights thoughtfully, we built a dashboard that engineers and engineering leaders actually want to use.This iterative, feedback-driven approach helped us build trust with our customers and align our product experience with the real needs of engineering teams. Whether it is surfacing pull request metrics, identifying top performers, or planning for new features like software composition analysis, our focus remains the same: helping teams ship high-quality code faster without compromising control, visibility, or security.Dashboards are not the product. Insight is. And when insights are surfaced with precision, context, and care, your product becomes indispensable.Panto can be your new AI Code Review Agent. We are focused on aligning business context with code. Never let bad code reach production again!

Many buyers—especially those sourcing globally—spend months searching for the right factory, communicating across time zones, negotiating pricing, and verifying product quality. The risks involved, including miscommunication, fraud, or mismatched expectations, can be extremely high.However, the sourcing landscape is evolving rapidly. Today, innovative AI-powered platforms are transforming global sourcing, making it faster, easier, and far more reliable to identify and collaborate with manufacturers. This article covers:
● Traditional sourcing methods and how they work
● The limitations and challenges of each approach
● How AI is reshaping the future of sourcing
● Why these changes matter to your business outcomesTraditional Ways to Find a Manufacturer or Supplier
For many years, businesses have relied on a few core strategies to source products. While each method offers some benefits, they all present significant drawbacks that can slow growth or increase risk.1. Online Directories and Marketplaces
Platforms like Alibaba, Global Sources, Made-in-China, and 1688.com (the latter primarily used by Mandarin speakers or those with translation tools) have become the most common starting points for finding suppliers, especially for buyers sourcing from China.
● Easy access to thousands of suppliers across various product categories
● Transparent listings for pricing, product specs, and minimum order quantities (MOQs)
● Convenient for initial supplier outreach
● The overwhelming number of options can make filtering difficult
● Many listings are middlemen, not actual factories
● Communication and language barriers are common
● Verifying supplier legitimacy requires manual, time-intensive effort
Events like the Canton Fair in Guangzhou or the Global Sources Summit in Hong Kong allow buyers to meet suppliers in person, inspect sample products, and build working relationships.
● Face-to-face interactions help validate both products and companies
● On-the-spot negotiation opportunities often lead to better deals
● Facilitates quicker trust-building
● International travel, accommodation, and attendance costs are significant
● Inaccessible to startups or small-budget businesses
● Events occur only at specific times—not available year-round3. Sourcing Agents and Consultants
Some businesses choose to work with independent sourcing agents, especially those based in China or Southeast Asia. These agents assist with supplier discovery, negotiation, and logistics coordination.
● Local market expertise and language fluency
● Faster supplier identification and response times
● Assistance with quality control, shipping, and documentation
● High fees or commission-based cost structures
● Success depends heavily on the agent’s integrity and experience
● Some agents promote preferred factories, even when they’re not the best fit4. Word of Mouth and Industry Referrals
Experienced buyers often rely on trusted networks for supplier recommendations, especially when entering new product categories or markets.
● Lower risk due to personal referrals
● Pre-established trust facilitates stronger partnerships
● Better alignment on expectations and quality
● Not scalable or systematized
● Difficult to apply for niche or custom product types
● Inaccessible for those new to the industryThe Core Challenges of Traditional Sourcing
No matter which traditional method you choose, the common sourcing pain points include: Searching, qualifying, and negotiating with suppliers can take weeks or months
● Low Transparency: **Many buyers struggle to confirm whether they're dealing with real manufacturers or intermediaries
● **Language and Cultural Gaps: Misunderstandings during communication can lead to costly production errors
●  Especially for newer or smaller businesses unfamiliar with supplier vetting
● **Limited Customization: **Many suppliers only accept large-volume Clearly, the traditional approach is ripe for transformation—particularly in a fast-moving, globalized economy.The AI Advantage: Transforming Modern SourcingModern AI-powered sourcing platforms function as virtual assistants working around the clock, streamlining every aspect of procurement. Solutions like  use advanced artificial intelligence to redefine how you search for and evaluate suppliers. Instead of scrolling through thousands of listings, users simply describe their sourcing needs—or upload images of target products—and the AI instantly scans expansive databases of manufacturers and product categories to return intelligent, verified recommendations.How AI Reshapes the Process:
● Reduces Time from Weeks to Minutes: Automates supplier discovery and vetting, delivering qualified results almost instantly.
● Understands Complex Buyer Intent: Goes beyond simple keywords, interpreting detailed requirements, business goals, and uncertainties to recommend the best-fit suppliers (e.g., cost-optimized, high-quality, scalable).
● Built-in Market Intelligence: Offers research tools analyzing real-time trends, sales data, and competitor behavior to identify opportunities, assess demand, and validate product ideas before production.
● Verified Supplier Networks: Pre-vetted manufacturers significantly reduce fraud and quality risks compared to open directories.
● Replaces fragmented emails and spreadsheets with a single dashboard for specifications, samples, timelines, and transactions.

These dense vectors, which capture semantic relationships, are known as embeddings (which are the foundation of retrieval-augmented generation, for RAG folks out there).So words that share context - think “king” & “queen” or “apple” & “pear” tend to cluster together due to the commonality of a proximal distance. However beyond mere proximity, embeddings capture consistent shifts.The vector from “man” to “woman” closely matches the shift from “king” to “queen.”So in classic Word2Vec experiments, when trained with billions of tokens, it's discovered that:v("Japan") – v("sushi") ≈ v("Germany") – v("bratwurst")So in plain English: if you take the “Japan→Sushi” vectorise and apply that same shift to “Germany,” you land right around “Bratwurst.” Without ever telling the model which foods belong where, it uncovers a “flagship-dish” axis that generalizes across cultures.We measure these analogies with a 'cosine similarity', which focuses on the angle between vectors rather than their length. A cosine of 1 means two vectors point in exactly the same direction, i.e., they encode the same relationship.So if a mate of yours loves Tacos (Mexico), you could suggest Burritos by following a similar shift.Bias auditing: By examining directional offsets (e.g., “doctor” – “man” vs. “doctor” – “woman”), you can then uncover and mitigate harmful stereotypes, map trends and much more. Cross-lingual transfer: Align embeddings across languages - so “chien” – “dog” ≈ “gato” – “cat” - enables zero-shot translation and multilingual search.Today’s common models (BERT, GPT) also generate dynamic embeddings: So “apple” in “tech” vs. “fruit” lives in different neighborhoods. Yet the same geometric insights apply, which helps powering translation, summarization, and even stuff like image-text alignment.So how does this relate to AI? Large language models sit on the shoulders of embeddings - with some more magic thrown in by means of "Transformers" - a layer that refines and contextualize vectors at every position, which is what makes them spookingly good at prediction and general wordsmithery, but underneath it's all just basic algebra.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Boost Productivity: The 10 AI Tools That Took Over My Job</title><link>https://dev.to/abhishekshakya/boost-productivity-the-10-ai-tools-that-took-over-my-job-5f15</link><author>Abhishek Shakya</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 06:03:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In today’s fast-paced digital world, being productive isn’t just a goal — it’s a survival skill.

They are the practical realization of Semantic Web principles, offering a structured and interconnected way to represent complex data that is easily consumable by both humans and machines. KGs are instrumental in breaking down data silos, enabling richer data analysis, and forming the backbone of intelligent applications. They move beyond traditional databases by focusing on the relationships between entities, providing context and meaning that is often lost in conventional data storage.In an increasingly data-driven world, the ability to understand and derive insights from vast and disparate datasets is paramount. Traditional relational databases, while efficient for structured data, often struggle with the complexity and interconnectedness of real-world information. The Semantic Web envisioned a web of data where information is given well-defined meaning, enabling computers and people to work in cooperation. Knowledge Graphs bring this vision to life by providing a framework to represent knowledge in a machine-readable format, using a graph-based structure of entities and their relationships. This structured representation allows for sophisticated queries, inferencing, and the discovery of hidden connections, leading to more profound insights and overcoming the limitations of isolated data.The foundation of Knowledge Graphs lies in established Semantic Web technologies. At their heart are:URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers): Just as URLs identify web pages, URIs provide unique identifiers for entities and relationships within a KG, ensuring global uniqueness and resolvability.RDF (Resource Description Framework): RDF is the standard model for data interchange on the Semantic Web. It represents information as "triples" – subject-predicate-object statements (e.g., "John Doe" "has authored" "Exploring Knowledge Graphs"). These triples form the basic building blocks of a graph, where subjects and objects are nodes, and predicates are the edges connecting them.SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language): SPARQL is the query language for RDF graphs, allowing users and applications to retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data stored in KGs. It's akin to SQL for relational databases but designed for graph structures. Ontologies, often expressed using OWL (Web Ontology Language), define the schema and relationships within a Knowledge Graph. They provide a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization of a domain. This includes defining classes of entities (e.g., , ), properties that describe these entities (e.g., , ), and relationships between them (e.g., , ). Ontologies are crucial for ensuring semantic consistency and enabling reasoning capabilities within the KG. For a deeper dive into the foundational principles, the W3C Semantic Web Standards offer comprehensive documentation.
  
  
  Building a Knowledge Graph (Practical Steps)
Constructing a Knowledge Graph involves several key stages:Data for a KG can originate from various sources: Relational databases, CSV files, and spreadsheets can be transformed into RDF triples using mapping tools or custom scripts. XML and JSON data often contain inherent hierarchical structures that can be mapped to graph representations. Text documents, web pages, and multimedia content require advanced techniques like Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Extraction (IE) to identify entities and relationships, which are then converted into RDF.Designing an effective ontology is critical. Consider a simplified e-commerce catalog:, , , ., , , , ., .This schema defines the vocabulary and structure of your e-commerce knowledge.
  
  
  Triplestores/Graph Databases
To store and query KGs efficiently, specialized databases are used: These databases are specifically designed to store RDF triples and support SPARQL queries. Examples include Apache Jena (a comprehensive Java framework for Semantic Web applications, as detailed on Apache Jena's website) and Virtuoso. While not strictly RDF-native, general-purpose graph databases like Neo4j can also be used to store graph-like data. They often use their own query languages (e.g., Cypher for Neo4j) but can be integrated with RDF data through mapping layers.Programmatic approaches are often used to populate KGs. Python's  is a popular choice for interacting with RDF graphs.
  
  
  Querying and Reasoning with KGs
The true power of KGs emerges when you query and reason over the interconnected data.SPARQL allows for complex pattern matching and retrieval. Building on the  example:This query retrieves the names of persons and the titles of books they have authored, demonstrating how SPARQL can traverse relationships.Reasoning engines can infer new facts from existing ones based on the ontology's rules or OWL axioms. For example, if an ontology defines that  implies , and we know "Alice  Carol," a reasoner can infer "Alice  Carol" even if that explicit triple isn't in the graph. This capability enriches the knowledge base without explicit data entry.Knowledge Graphs significantly enhance Artificial Intelligence applications by providing structured context and background knowledge.Natural Language Understanding (NLU): KGs provide a semantic backbone for NLU, helping AI models understand the meaning and relationships between entities in text. For instance, a KG can disambiguate words with multiple meanings or identify specific entities and their attributes. By understanding user preferences and item characteristics through a KG, recommendation engines can provide more accurate and diverse suggestions, moving beyond simple collaborative filtering.Chatbots and Virtual Assistants: KGs enable chatbots to answer complex questions and engage in more natural conversations by providing a structured representation of domain knowledge. In financial services, KGs can identify suspicious patterns and relationships between entities (e.g., individuals, accounts, transactions) that might indicate fraudulent activity.One of the growing challenges in AI is the "black box" problem, where complex models make decisions without clear explanations. KGs contribute to Explainable AI (XAI) by making AI decisions more transparent. Since KGs explicitly represent relationships and facts, the reasoning path of an AI model that leverages a KG can often be traced and understood. This transparency is crucial in domains like healthcare and finance, where accountability and trust are paramount.Knowledge Graphs are already powering numerous intelligent applications across various industries:Google's Knowledge Graph: Perhaps the most famous example, Google's Knowledge Graph enhances search results by providing structured information about entities (people, places, things) and their relationships, leading to direct answers and richer search experiences. KGs are used in drug discovery, patient data management, and clinical decision support. They can link genes, proteins, diseases, and drugs to accelerate research and personalize treatments. For risk assessment, compliance, and fraud detection, KGs help connect disparate data points related to transactions, individuals, and organizations, revealing complex relationships and potential risks. Beyond basic recommendations, KGs enable personalized shopping experiences, intelligent product search, and supply chain optimization by understanding product attributes, customer behavior, and logistics. KGs help organize vast content libraries, enable smarter content recommendations, and facilitate content syndication by providing a structured representation of articles, authors, topics, and events.
  
  
  Challenges and Future Outlook
Despite their immense potential, implementing Knowledge Graphs comes with challenges: The effectiveness of a KG heavily relies on the quality and consistency of the ingested data. Inaccurate or incomplete data can lead to erroneous inferences. Building and managing KGs for massive datasets requires robust infrastructure and efficient graph database solutions.Integration Complexities: Integrating KGs with existing enterprise systems and data sources can be complex, requiring careful planning and specialized tools. As domains evolve, so too must their ontologies, necessitating flexible and manageable update processes.The future of Knowledge Graphs is bright, with ongoing advancements in automated knowledge graph construction, more sophisticated reasoning capabilities, and tighter integration with machine learning techniques. The convergence of AI and Semantic Web technologies, as explored in articles like "AI and the Semantic Web," will continue to drive innovation, making KGs an even more indispensable component of intelligent applications. As the digital landscape becomes increasingly complex, Knowledge Graphs will serve as the crucial framework for organizing, understanding, and leveraging the world's knowledge.

Addressing these issues requires significant time and resources, but the investment is essential for successful AI deployment.
Change Management and Employee Training
Successful AI implementation requires comprehensive change management strategies that address employee concerns and provide adequate training. Workers need to understand how AI systems will affect their roles and how to work effectively with these new tools.
Companies that invest in proper training and change management report higher success rates and faster adoption of AI systems. Employee resistance decreases significantly when workers understand the benefits and receive adequate support during the transition period.
Future Trends and Opportunities
The field of AI development continues to evolve rapidly, with new applications and capabilities emerging regularly. Edge computing, quantum computing, and advanced neural networks are opening new possibilities for business applications that were previously impossible or impractical.
Artificial intelligence developer roles are expanding to include specializations in specific industries and applications. This trend reflects the growing sophistication of AI systems and the need for deep domain expertise to create effective solutions.
The integration of AI with other emerging technologies like blockchain, Internet of Things, and augmented reality is creating new opportunities for business transformation. Companies that stay ahead of these trends will have significant competitive advantages in the coming years.
As AI technology continues to mature, we can expect even more dramatic transformations in how businesses operate, compete, and serve their customers in the digital economy.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Beyond Code Generation: Continuously Evolve Text with LLMs</title><link>https://towardsdatascience.com/beyond-code-generation-continuously-evolve-text-with-llms/</link><author>Julian Mendel</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 05:33:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://towardsdatascience.com/">Towards Data Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Long-running content evolution and an introduction to result analysis]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI as a Development Tool: Enhancing, Not Replacing</title><link>https://dev.to/mrwilde/ai-as-a-development-tool-enhancing-not-replacing-228e</link><author>Robert Wilde</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 05:12:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The conversation around AI in software development continues to evolve, and I've recently experienced some breakthroughs that have fundamentally changed how I view these tools. The key insight? AI serves as a helper, not a replacement – and this distinction matters more than we might think.Throughout my career across different industries, including construction, I've learned that tools are everything. Yet developers often have strong, sometimes puzzling preferences. Why do some developers choose VS Code for PHP development when PHPStorm offers comprehensive, purpose-built functionality? The answer lies not in the tool itself, but in how we choose to leverage it.
  
  
  Reducing Development Arrogance
One of the most unexpected benefits I've discovered in working with AI tools is how they've reduced my tendency toward development arrogance. As a contractor, I've encountered numerous approaches to writing code:The general framework-specific best practicesInternet-wide accepted standardsInternal company style guides (often defended with "that's how we've always done it")Previously, I might have stubbornly advocated for my approach. Now, AI helps me evaluate these different perspectives objectively. This shift is particularly valuable when working on greenfield projects or MVPs, where I've learned to view everything as potential technical debt until it reaches production.
  
  
  The Power of Rapid Iteration
AI has transformed my development workflow by enabling rapid scenario testing. I can now:Compare different approaches and their trade-offsAnalyze package documentation against framework requirementsEvaluate compatibility issues across different componentsConsider multiple implementation strategies simultaneouslyWhat previously took a week of research and experimentation can now be accomplished in hours. This isn't about cutting corners – it's about exploring more possibilities and making better-informed decisions.
  
  
  Ownership and Responsibility
Here's a crucial point: when you use AI to help write code, it remains your code. You are responsible for it. Others will review it as if you wrote every line yourself – because ultimately, you did. AI is simply another tool in your toolkit, similar to linters, static analysis tools, or any other development aid.This perspective drives home the importance of:Implementing comprehensive testingEnsuring proper test coverageVerifying that tests actually validate functionalityMaintaining code quality standards
  
  
  Beyond Copy-Paste Development
Using AI effectively isn't about laziness. Developers who use AI poorly are often the same ones who blindly copied from Stack Overflow without understanding the code. The tool may have changed, but the underlying methodology and thought process should remain rigorous and thoughtful.
  
  
  Learning Through Application
Perhaps most surprisingly, I've learned more in recent months using AI tools than in years of traditional development. Working on unique, complex projects – including replicating legacy applications with their quirks intact – has pushed me to understand not just how to code, but why certain approaches work better than others.The ability to quickly generate multiple test cases, explore edge conditions, and consider alternative implementations has made me a more thorough and thoughtful developer. When replicating legacy systems, AI helps identify potential bugs that might actually be features, allowing me to document and preserve intentional behaviors while building in flexibility for future corrections.AI in development isn't about replacing human judgment or creativity. It's about amplifying our capabilities, reducing cognitive load, and enabling us to focus on what matters most: solving problems effectively. By embracing these tools while maintaining our professional standards and responsibility, we can create better software faster – without sacrificing quality or understanding.The key is remembering that AI assists us in writing code; it doesn't write code for us. This distinction shapes how we approach development, how we maintain quality, and ultimately, how we grow as professionals in an evolving technological landscape.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Top 10 Generative AI Programming Languages</title><link>https://dev.to/brilworks/top-10-generative-ai-programming-languages-110l</link><author>Vikas Singh</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 04:50:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Artificial intelligence has pervaded our lives, from smartphones to autonomous driving vehicles. The world is set to become an AI-driven society where AI will presumably take over major tasks, from complex business operations to software development. McKinsey states generative AI, a subset of AI, could alone create a trillion dollars in the global economy across 63 use cases they analyzed. According to Gartner, nearly 80 percent of organizations are projected to use AI in some capacity by 2026, a notable increase from only 5 percent in 2023.  Customer service, marketing, sales, product development, and R&D are areas where generative AI is having a profound impact.If we interpret these figures, generative AI development is set to bring about a dramatic change in current technological dimensions, signaling to companies and software engineers that the perfect time to move into AI development is now. AI is expanding across different industries, and so is the demand for generative AI developers, AI engineers, and data scientists.Over the years, new technologies have emerged, paving the way for modern AI development. But all of this happening today would have remained a sci-fi concept without the advancement of programming languages.So, what are the languages used today by prominent organizations? What are the most popular programming languages software engineers are using to build cutting-edge AI programs? We will explore this in the post, highlighting their core features and what makes them suitable for generative AI development.
  
  
  Components of an AI Program
Let's first understand what generative AI is. A generative AI program combines different technologies that work together behind the scenes to generate text, audio, and visual output. It means that a generative AI program isn't a monolithic entity. Therefore, developers may use different programming languages to develop an AI program. Machine learning models are typically built using languages like Python with frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. For data processing or to build programs to handle large datasets, Python, R, or Scala are used. React, and Vue.js are some popular frameworks for frontend & user interaction. While Flutter or React Native are widely used as a mobile development framework. Node.js, Go, or Rust is very popular for backend & API writing in AI software development.Additionally, there are numerous options available for software engineers to learn, which we will cover later in this article. 
  
  
  Top 10 Generative AI Programming Languages
This ranking reflects factors like available libraries, speed, developer backing, and how well each language handles generative AI work. While the tech world keeps shifting, these languages are currently at the forefront of AI programming.
Python is one of the most popular AI development programming languages. It is a simple, robust, rich, and most-used language in AI-related projects on GitHub. Python is heavily used (or most preferred) for tasks such as text generation, image synthesis, and code generation.In 2024, it grew almost twice as much as the year before. For developers, libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face make it easier to build and roll out AI models. Python is the dominant AI programming language for generative AI due to its simplicity and extensive ecosystem.Popular libraries TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face streamline model development and deployment.Python is the most preferred choice to build programs for text generation, image synthesis, and code generation.One limitation is slower runtime performance compared to compiled languages.Strengths for generative AI applicationsExtensive AI and ML librariesEasy integration with AI platformsRapid prototyping capabilities
R isn't as well-known as Python for AI, but it still earns its place, especially when you're working with data. It is one of the most loved programming languages for data scientists.Built for statistics and data analysis, it helps understand the data, check results, and make reports in AI programs that others can actually read. An important feature of R is gradient boosting, which is used to improve model accuracy. Besides, you can integrate Python libraries into your R project. If you're working on machine learning experiments, visualizing model outputs, or explaining how a model behaves, R is a strong programming language. There are so many packages you can find in R. Some of the popular packages for AI development are as follows: AI Packages in R
Data preparation and visualizationdplyr: For data cleaning, filtering, and transformation.ggplot2, lattice, plotly, and leaflet: Popular for static and interactive data visualization.Machine Learning Librariescaret: A widely used package for building predictive models with comprehensive features.mlr3: A modern, object-oriented ML framework with excellent documentation.XGBoost: Specialized for gradient boosting, a key technique in AI with R.Keras: Simplifies deep learning workflows and works as a front-end to TensorFlow.TensorFlow: Google's AI framework with strong R support.Torch: An established deep learning library, mainly used in research.Natural Language Processingtm: Text mining and preprocessing.Quanteda: Advanced NLP toolkit with text processing and visualization features.NLP: A comprehensive package offering tokenization, annotation, and more.OpenCV: Accessible in R via the opencv package, complements Torch and Keras for vision tasks.Over half of data scientists use it. R ranks 4th in programming language popularity (PYPL, March 2025). [Source]It is great for visualizations with tools like ggplot2 and shiny. R makes it easy to turn data into clear visuals.R helps explain models. It's often used in healthcare, finance, and research, where understanding results matters more than just building the next big model.R role for generative AI developmentPowerful statistical analysis toolsExcellent data visualizationStrong support for exploratory data analysisChoose R over Python when statistical modeling and visualization are top priorities.
Java plays a quieter, more focused role in AI development. It has been a reliable choice for large, complex, enterprise-grade software for decades. In AI, it finds its place mostly in big organizations. Industries like banking, healthcare, and telecom often rely on Java to manage AI components because it fits well into their existing technology stacks.There are two parts to most AI projects.This is the stage where models learn from large sets of data. It demands a lot of computing power and access to a wide range of tools and libraries. Most of these tools are built around Python because the ecosystem is more complete. That includes support for GPUs, data pipelines, and interactive tools.Could training be done in Java? Yes, but you would lose access to most of what makes modern AI workflows fast and flexible. It would also take more time to set things up and maintain them.This is where Java becomes more relevant. Inference means taking a trained model and using it to make predictions, process images, or respond to user input. Java fits well here, especially in systems that are already built with it. Java is widely used in large software systems. When companies want to add AI features, they often do it using the same language.Libraries like Deep Java Library (DJL) and TensorFlow Java make it easier to load and use pre-trained models.Java is known for stability and speed. That makes it a good choice when the focus is on performance and reliability rather than experimenting with new models.It's used when AI needs to be part of a larger software system that runs smoothly over time. Tools like Deeplearning4j allow Java to handle some deep learning tasks, making it possible to build AI models without switching to a different language or platform. Java also benefits from big data tools like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark, used for handling large volumes of information. Manages large datasets and heavy workloads efficientlyOffers strong security for sensitive informationWell-supported with mature tools and librariesIntegrates smoothly with big data frameworksSuitable for embedding AI in complex, existing softwareKnown for stability and reliability in productionHandles multithreading and parallel processing well, which can improve performanceHas a large developer community and long-term supportJava isn't typically the first choice for AI researchers or small projects, but it becomes important when AI solutions need to work reliably inside big, mission-critical systems. It's less about being the fastest or most flexible language and more about being a solid foundation for AI at scale.
Many popular ML libraries, like TensorFlow and PyTorch, have core components written in C++. It is a mature language for the backend part, whether it is an AI program or any other program. Though it is not a primary language for AI programs, it can be used in performance-critical areas. And if you are going to build a program that is supposed to run on low-end devices, C++ can be a good bet. With this language, you can have fine-grained control over memory and system resources, as it allows direct control over memory and hardware. C++ is valued in AI for its ability to deliver fast and efficient performance, especially where computing power or memory is limited. This makes it a solid choice for AI running on devices with restricted resources. You can use it when you are building embedded systems or edge devices.Executes code very quicklyLets programmers control memory use preciselyProvides low-level hardware access for optimizationWorks well in embedded or edge environmentsIdeal for AI that demands real-time responses or runs on specialized chipsC++ is less about ease of use and more about getting the best performance in situations where every millisecond or byte of memory counts. For AI applications that need to run fast and lean, C++ remains a strong option.
Julia combines speed with clear, math-friendly syntax. Its performance is near that of C++, but it feels simpler to use, often compared to Python in terms of readability. This balance has led to growing interest in Julia among AI researchers and scientists. It handles calculations and data manipulation without slowing down. Its multiple dispatch is well praised by the developers' community, enabling devs to write flexible and reusable functions.If you want to explore a fresh approach compared to traditional object-oriented designs, Julia is the answer for AI development. Libraries like Flux and Knet provide tools for building neural networks and working with data efficiently. Julia's flexibility is a strength; some developers find its approach to interfaces and code organization takes getting used to, especially if you come from languages with more rigid structures.In short, Julia offers a fresh balance: it's straightforward enough to write quickly and clear enough to understand easily, yet it keeps performance tight for serious number crunching. This mix is why more people are turning to Julia for AI and scientific projects, and it's shaping up to be a solid tool for those looking to do more without slowing down.Handles heavy numerical computing efficientlyUses syntax that matches mathematical expressions closelyEasily connects with Python and C libraries for flexibilityHas an expanding community focused on AI and scientific tasksWhile still gaining traction, Julia is becoming a popular choice for those who want both speed and clarity when working on AI projects, especially in research and scientific fields.
Scala blends functional and object-oriented programming, which helps when working on AI tasks that involve handling lots of data or running processes in parallel. It fits naturally with big data tools like Apache Spark, making it a good pick for AI projects that need to analyze or generate insights from large datasets.Libraries such as Breeze and Spark MLlib provide support for building AI models, including generative ones, within the Scala environment. This makes Scala useful when AI needs to run alongside heavy data processing tasks.Supports both functional and object-oriented stylesIntegrates tightly with big data platforms like SparkHandles concurrency well for better performanceScales effectively for large, distributed datasetsCommonly used where AI overlaps with big data processingScala is not typically used for small AI projects but comes into its own in environments where AI and big data work together on a larger scale.
JavaScript is essential for AI that runs directly in web browsers. It allows AI models to be trained and used without needing special software, making AI accessible to anyone with a modern browser.Libraries like TensorFlow.js let developers build and test AI models right in the browser, which is great for quick demos and interactive tools. This ease of use helps spread AI applications to a wide audience without a complex setup.Works on all modern browsers without extra installsSupports interactive AI experiences on the webHas a large, active developer communitySpeeds up prototyping and testing for web-based AIJavaScript's role in AI shines where accessibility and ease of use are priorities, especially for creating web apps and demos that anyone can access instantly.
Lisp holds an important place in AI history as one of the first languages used for AI research. Its strength lies in symbolic processing, which makes it well-suited for AI tasks that involve reasoning, logic, and language manipulation.Though less common today, modern versions of Lisp are still used in specialized AI projects, especially those experimenting with new ideas or working on complex symbolic AI problems.Role of Lisp in AI developmentExcels at symbolic computation and logicOffers flexible syntax that can be adapted easilyHas a long history of use in AI research and developmentUseful for quickly testing new AI conceptsLisp remains relevant in areas where symbolic reasoning and language-based AI are key, even if it's not widely used for general AI development anymore.
Rust is gaining attention in AI development for its focus on performance without sacrificing safety. It avoids common issues like memory leaks and race conditions, which are especially important when building complex AI systems that need to run reliably.While its AI ecosystem is still growing, libraries such as tch-rs (bindings for PyTorch) and burn offer practical tools for working with generative models. Rust's strong support for concurrency also makes it appealing for AI workloads that need to run in parallel or scale across threads safely.Why Rust is being explored for AIOffers memory safety without garbage collectionDelivers performance close to C++Helps prevent bugs common in multi-threaded codeHas emerging libraries for model training and inferenceUseful for engineers building secure, scalable AI systemsRust isn't yet a go-to AI language, but it's becoming a serious option for developers who want low-level control and safety, especially in performance-critical or production-grade AI projects.
Mojo is a recent entry in the programming world. It combines the familiarity of Python with the performance of low-level languages. It supports Python syntax and tooling. Though still early in development, Mojo is showing promise in tasks that require high-performance training and inference.Why Mojo is gaining attention in AIBuilt from scratch for AI and machine learningCompatible with Python, easing the learning curveDelivers low-level performance for heavy AI workloadsDrawing interest from early adopters in AI researchMojo isn't mainstream yet, but it's being closely watched by developers looking for the next generation of AI-focused programming tools.
  
  
  How To Choose An AI Development Language
There's no single "best" language for AI, what works depends on your specific goals. If your project demands fast prototyping and a large ecosystem, Python is often the default. But if you're working with limited hardware, C++ or Rust might serve better. For statistical tasks or research-heavy models, R or Julia can be strong options. And for web-based AI tools, JavaScript makes deployment easier.Team familiarity: Don't ignore the learning curve, choose what your team can work with efficiently.Deployment target: Edge devices? Cloud? Browser? That changes your options.Library support: Some languages have better tools for training, others for inference.Long-term maintenance: Languages with strong typing or memory safety (like Rust or Java) may save debugging time later.Instead of chasing trends, match the language to the problem you're solving. The right choice is usually the one that balances capability, compatibility, and developer speed.
  
  
  Emerging AI Hottest New Programming Trends
As generative AI matures, the tools and languages powering it are shifting, too. Here are some trends influencing how developers choose programming languages for AI today:

## What Makes A Language Suitable For Generative AI
Not every language is built to handle the demands of generative AI. Some are faster. Others offer better tools. What sets a language apart comes down to a few key factors:Does it offer ready-to-use tools for model building, training, and deployment?Can it handle heavy computation without slowing down or crashing?Are there enough developers, tutorials, and discussions to learn from or get unstuck?How easily does it work with AI platforms, cloud APIs, and other tools in your stack?Can new team members pick it up without weeks of onboarding?These criteria guided our list of the top AI programming languages for 2025, not based on hype but on how well each language supports real-world generative AI development.
  
  
  Is AI Based Programming Changing Development
Yes, and not in small ways. AI is reshaping how software gets built, tested, and shipped. Traditional development isn't going away, but it's evolving to fit into an AI-augmented workflow. Here's how:
Tools like GitHub Copilot and other code-generation systems help devs move faster—filling in boilerplate, suggesting functions, even writing tests.2. The skillset is shifting
It's no longer just about knowing syntax. Developers are learning how to write prompts, curate datasets, and fine-tune models.3. Workflows look different now
Software teams are adding steps for data prep, model integration, and continuous AI monitoring alongside their regular CI/CD flows.Programming languages are adapting, too, getting better AI library support, improving cross-language compatibility, and making space for new development patterns shaped by generative models. AI isn't replacing developers. It's redefining the toolkit.So, which one is the best? Python dominates, but it is not a one-size-fits-all solution. The right selection of programming languages depends on what you are going to build. Some of the areas are where R or Scala may excel, while Julia and Lisp can be better choices in other scenarios. Some of the programming languages are built only to solve particular issues that well-established languages lack.For example, Python may not be the right choice for advanced statistical modeling or high-performance numerical computation. Languages like R, Scala, Julia, or Lisp can do a better job. Overall, there's no one-size-fits-all for building AI software. You can choose the right one only after defining what you are going to build. Our advice is that when you are picking a programming language, popularity alone should not be the sole factor. When you think beyond popularity, hype, and trends, you will find the perfect language. If you're planning an AI project but can't decide which technology suits your goals, don’t get lost in trends.

  Generative vs Predictive AI: Key Similarities & Differences 

  
  
  What Do Gen AI and Predictive AI Have in Common?
Both Generative AI and Predictive AI are designed to simulate and enhance human intelligence. They are powered by machine learning (ML) techniques that enable them to acquire knowledge from data and apply that understanding to solve problems or assist with tasks.Much like how humans accumulate memories, experiences, and knowledge over time, these models are trained on massive datasets. When we create—whether it’s writing a story, painting, or coding—we often draw from what we've previously seen, heard, or learned. AI functions similarly: it identifies patterns in its training data and uses those patterns to generate or predict meaningful outputs.
  
  
  What is the difference between Generative AI and Predictive AI?
Generative AI and Predictive AI represent two distinct approaches within the field of artificial intelligence. Each is tailored to a specific purpose, Including Data Used, Training Approach, Applications, and limitations. The comparison below outlines these differences to help you better understand how each type of AI works and when to use them. is designed to produce original outputs—such as language, visuals, or code—by learning and replicating underlying patterns found in their training data.

While innovation drives progress, it also introduces new complexities and potential vulnerabilities. Threat modeling, a structured approach to identifying, quantifying, and addressing security risks, is an indispensable practice in modern software development. However, despite its critical importance, traditional threat modeling often faces significant hurdles that limit its widespread adoption and effectiveness.
  
  
  The Bottlenecks of Traditional Threat Modeling
The conventional approach to threat modeling, while thorough, is notoriously resource-intensive. One of the primary challenges is the  it demands. Security analysts must meticulously review system designs, architectural diagrams, data flows, and trust boundaries. This manual process can be slow, especially for large, intricate systems or organizations managing numerous concurrent projects. The sheer volume of information and the need for detailed analysis often lead to delays, making threat modeling a bottleneck in agile development cycles.Another significant hurdle is the need for specialized expertise. Effective threat modeling requires a deep understanding of various security domains, including common attack vectors, vulnerability classes, and mitigation strategies. Such expertise is often scarce and expensive, making it difficult for many development teams to integrate threat modeling consistently. Without dedicated security professionals, development teams might overlook critical risks or apply generic, ineffective mitigations.Finally,  threat modeling across numerous projects poses a substantial challenge. In large enterprises, hundreds or even thousands of applications might be under development or in production. Manually performing in-depth threat models for each of these systems is simply not feasible. This scalability issue often results in threat modeling being applied only to the most critical systems, leaving a vast attack surface unanalyzed and vulnerable. These inherent bottlenecks mean that, despite its clear benefits, threat modeling is often underutilized, leading to accumulated security debt and reactive security measures.
  
  
  Generative AI as the Game Changer
Generative AI is poised to revolutionize threat modeling by directly addressing these traditional limitations, transforming it from a manual, expert-driven process into an automated, scalable, and highly efficient security practice. Its ability to understand, reason, and generate human-like content makes it uniquely suited for the complexities of security analysis.Automated Vulnerability Identification: Generative AI models can rapidly ingest and analyze vast amounts of data, including system designs, architectural documentation, data flow diagrams, and even code snippets. Unlike traditional static analysis tools that rely on predefined rules, AI can "interpret nuanced system designs" and "infer security implications across interconnected components," identifying potential weaknesses that might be hidden in complex interactions. This significantly accelerates the initial phase of threat identification.Comprehensive Attack Scenario Generation: One of the most powerful capabilities of Generative AI in this domain is its ability to reason about complex system interactions and generate novel, context-aware attack paths. Human analysts, no matter how experienced, can sometimes miss subtle attack vectors. AI, drawing from extensive datasets and understanding of adversarial tactics, can "reason about novel attack vectors" and create comprehensive attack scenarios that human analysts might overlook. This includes identifying multi-stage attacks and lateral movement possibilities.Contextual Mitigation Strategies: Beyond identifying threats, Generative AI can provide tailored and actionable recommendations for mitigating identified risks. By integrating with and drawing from vast security databases like the MITRE ATT&CK Framework, which catalogs adversary tactics and techniques, and the OWASP Foundation's extensive resources on web application security, AI can suggest precise and effective countermeasures. These recommendations are context-aware, meaning they are specific to the identified vulnerability and the system's architecture, moving beyond generic advice.Understanding Complex System Relationships: Generative AI's multimodal capabilities allow it to process not just textual descriptions but also visual diagrams, such as network topologies and architectural blueprints. This enables the AI to build a holistic understanding of the system's components, data flows, and trust boundaries, inferring security implications across even the most interconnected and distributed environments.
  
  
  Enabling "Shift-Left" Security
The integration of AI-powered threat modeling is a crucial enabler for the "shift-left" security paradigm. Shift-left security advocates for embedding security considerations and practices early in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), ideally during the design and planning phases, rather than as an afterthought.By automating and accelerating the threat modeling process, Generative AI allows developers and security teams to identify and address potential vulnerabilities at their inception. This proactive strategy significantly reduces the accumulation of security debt, which is the cost and effort required to fix security flaws later in the development cycle or after deployment. When security is integrated from the beginning, it transforms from a reactive bottleneck into a proactive enabler of innovation, fostering the development of more resilient and secure systems from the ground up. This approach also allows for continuous threat modeling, adapting to changes in the system design throughout its lifecycle. For a deeper dive into modern threat modeling methodologies, explore resources on threat modeling secure software.
  
  
  Practical Implementation & Conceptual Examples
Tools and frameworks leveraging Generative AI for threat modeling are already emerging. A notable example is AWS Threat Designer, which utilizes enterprise-grade foundation models like Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 3.7 to automate threat assessments at scale. These tools allow users to input system descriptions, architectural diagrams, and other relevant information, and the AI then generates a comprehensive threat report.Consider a conceptual example of how a system description might be fed into an AI threat modeling tool and what a typical output would look like:In this example, the AI processes the system_architecture_description to understand the components, data flows, and trust boundaries. It then leverages its knowledge base to identify potential threats, categorize their severity, and propose concrete mitigation strategies, along with generating plausible attack scenarios. This output provides developers with immediate, actionable security insights.The application of Generative AI in threat modeling is still in its early stages, but the potential for its impact is immense. As AI models become more sophisticated, capable of deeper contextual understanding and more nuanced reasoning, their ability to identify and mitigate security risks will only grow. Future advancements may include real-time threat modeling that adapts to code changes, predictive threat intelligence based on emerging attack trends, and even automated remediation suggestions that can be directly integrated into development pipelines. Generative AI is not just enhancing threat modeling; it is fundamentally reshaping how security analysis is performed, making secure software development more accessible, efficient, and robust for developers and security professionals alike.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Use IEEE Xplore for Effective Prior Art Searches</title><link>https://dev.to/patentscanai/how-to-use-ieee-xplore-for-effective-prior-art-searches-515n</link><author>Zainab Imran</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 03:45:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In today’s fast-paced world of innovation, missing a key piece of prior art can mean the difference between groundbreaking research and a failed patent application.

Eu posso até não ter achado a forma ideal ainda, mas eu continuo nessa procura. Eu realmente acho que depois de a tecnologia evoluir tanto, a gente não precisa mais trabalhar como datilógrafos do século passado.Se você parar pra observar o quanto o nosso modelo de trabalho evoluiu nos últimos anos comparado às tecnologias que a gente desenvolve, você vai notar um gap muito grande. A gente desenvolveu aplicações distribuídas, blockchain, inteligência artificial, visão computacional, e muitas outras coisas absurdamente incríveis, ao mesmo tempo que nós continuamos fazendo isso sentados (alguns de pé) escrevendo em uma tela branca – pode me zoar, eu não uso dark mode.Os softwares de reconhecimento de voz eram horríveis sim, mas o Ditado do Mac não é mais aquela coisa primitiva que rodava em um Symbian. E se você não conhece o Symbian, me avisa pra eu parar de usar exemplos velhos.Eu imagino que essas ferramentas só vão melhorar ao longo do tempo, e sinceramente eu não quero ficar parado no tempo fazendo coisas como eu fazia lá em 2010. Te convido a fazer o mesmo.Tenho testado algumas formas diferentes de trabalhar nesses últimos anos. Isso inclui inteligência artificial, comandos de voz, e até o amado/odiado vibe coding. Quero compartilhar dois pontos que estão mudando a minha forma de trabalhar, e talvez mude a sua também.A menos que você esteja vivendo em uma caverna, você já deve ter ouvido falar de AI Agents. Resumindo de uma forma bem rasa, um AI agent é um ChatGPT turbinado que executa tarefas de forma autônoma direto na sua IDE. Ele cria features, altera arquivos e roda comandos com um único prompt, o que te permite realizar mudanças significativas em segundos.AI Agents são o presente, e eu recomendo fortemente que façam parte do seu workflow. Dependendo da linguagem você pode querer usar uma IDE com o AI Agent e outra que você se sentir mais confortável pra programar, mas vale muito a pena. O ganho de produtividade é absurdo, e do momento que você cria o seu próprio framework com o Cursor Rules ou similar, o Agent começa a gerar um código bem parecido com o que você escreveria.Pensando em time, você também consegue adicionar essas regras ao repositório, e outras pessoas do time usando AI Agents terão resultados parecidos. Você também pode pedir uma revisão de código pro seu Agent baseado nas regras antes de submeter pra revisão do time.P.S.: Se alguém usa a AI da JetBrains, defende ela aqui porque eu não curti muito.
  
  
  2. Ditado e comandos de voz
Algo relativamente antigo, genérico e que funciona em várias aplicações diferentes é o Ditado. A proposta é bem simples: você consegue escrever falando. Isso serve pra mandar mensagens, pedir pra inteligência artificial criar alguma coisa, ou pedir pra Siri tocar uma música. Isso vai te fazer pensar duas vezes antes de mandar aquele áudio que poderia ser uma mensagem.Eu não sou um heavy user da Siri, tenho conhecimento muito básico de assistentes, e mantenho o "Hey Siri" desativado porque eu ainda sou meio bolado com um celular ou computador me ouvindo o tempo todo, mas tenho mudado minha cabeça quanto isso porque eu acho algo inevitável."Ah mas o ChatGPT tem modo voz". Concordo totalmente, mas o modo de voz do ChatGPT não vai abrir o seu WhatsApp e mandar uma mensagem (ainda), ou escrever algo dentro da sua IDE. Se você aliar o ditado do mac ou do Windows a uma IDE com AI Agent, você vai simplesmente abrir uma classe de entity, e dizer em voz alta "create a repository for this entity". Voilà. O AI Agent vai começar criar.Eu não sei dizer a qualidade dos prompts em português, mas no teste que eu fiz funcionou perfeitamente. Até porque os modelos usados são o Claude, GPT, Gemini, e outros grandes que a gente já usa no dia a dia.Aqui vão os links sobre como habilitar o modo de ditado: macOS e Windows.Falar com uma AI, ver ela programando e só revisar o resultado me faz sentir o Homem de Ferro falando com o Jarvis. Eu acho algo incrível e que só tem a melhorar no futuro.A maioria dessas ferramentas possuem um período de testes gratuito, então vale muito a pena fazer um teste. Te garanto que você vai curtir um bocado. Dica: O Claude é meu modelo favorito mesmo no GitHub Copilot, mas embora eu tenha usado o Copilot desde os betas, hoje eu tô no time do Cursor.Ainda me vejo escrevendo prompts muito mais pelo costume do que pela facilidade. Mudar a forma de trabalhar depois de mais de uma década é complicado. E se você tem LER, que são aquelas lesões por esforço repetitivo, isso vai te ajudar um bocado a digitar menos e aliviar elas também – mas não esqueça da fisioterapia.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>📌 IdeaWeaver: One CLI to Train, Track, and Deploy Your LLM with Custom Data 📌</title><link>https://dev.to/lakhera2015/ideaweaver-one-cli-to-train-track-and-deploy-your-llm-with-custom-data-47g6</link><author>Prashant Lakhera</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 03:31:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Are you looking for a single tool that can handle the entire lifecycle of training a model on your data, track experiments, and register models effortlessly?Meet IdeaWeaver.

  News flash you've been lied to.
Have you ever wondered how the first ChatGPT model was produced? Did they somehow use a time machine to create a rip though the fabric of reality and prompt an o3 model in the future, no, it was produced with a little bit of human ingenuity and the good old-fashioned human brain, truth be told you have the most powerful computer that open AI is so desperately trying to replicate and its right in your head, It belongs to you, not in some buzzing computer cluster, that used to be a storage warehouse for pets.com. let’s begin by reviewing these notion's and why its so easy to fall into from a marketing level.
  
  
  Companies have to lie (sort of)
One vital thing to understand is the incentive behind lying and or exaggerating a product such as an LLM. These companies have to lie as a means of survival, especially since LLM's  as a technology are still very much in its infancy, AI companies such as OpenAI , google and sonnet, all have an incentive to exaggerate the effectiveness of their products, not only to you but also to their shareholders, all for the benefit and growth of a company.  Now understanding this, we can begin to see why these companies make so many remarkable claims about their product with little to no evidence. They’re simply in a position that requires them to do so for their self interest.Its simply marketing, marketing is an effective strategy used for decades to control the perception around your company and its products.
“There is no minimum requirement for me to strive for perfection — therefore, perfection lies far outside my scope.”I believe, one of the primary beliefs that keep people constrained to this attachment to ai, is the false notion that ai somehow leads to a more perfect, or effective product. Lets first shatter the illusion of achievable perfection.Let’s think about this first from a systems level perspective .
A decision tree graph is a node based tree graph that is used to represent a chain of outcomes and decisions leading to a final outcome. For every decision, there is a new set of sequential decisions, the amount of decisions per node grows exponentially. You cannot make a perfect decision on top of every other previous decision in the tree even if you tried to, simply doing so is statically impossible. This means, that in order to produce a perfect solution (like your sorting algorithm), you would have to first traverse the entire decision tree, doing so will take more than several lifetimes. The brutal reality is that all of human technology falls victim to this constraint. This is why we have minimum requirement's, a minimum requirement is the same reason why I own and use my car despite it being no where near perfection, Its minimum requirement is that it gets me from a to z in a safe and timely manner. We as human beings have the tendency to over optimize or analyze for many edge cases.  Additionally, this i why "vibe coding" can be so difficult, for every piece of code you ordinary LLM outputs, it will also find and suggest many more improvements that which in themselves have  other improvements that can be made upon and thus you are left with an exponentially large chain of possible decisions and improvements. Perhaps this is what the first popular tweet regarding vibe coding was referring to as "the exponentials".Systems level thinking is the same reason why, Im being cautious to over analyze my writing, It's because the minimum requirement is the transfer of concepts via literature. It keeps me in scope, something ai cannot do.
  
  
  I could go on and on about ai inability to think critically but let me know if you care for it in the meantime it lies outside my scope of minimum requirements.

  the problem: your bot becomes a feature mixer
customer asks about basic plan, bot responds with enterprise features. the worst part? you can't see it happening without proper monitoring.real example that almost got me fired:user: "what reporting features are in the starter plan?"bot: "the starter plan includes basic reports, custom dashboards, advanced analytics, real-time monitoring, and api access."starter plan only has basic reports. everything else came from enterprise docs.
  
  
  how traceloop saved my debugging nightmare
before traceloop, i was console.logging everything like an animal. after adding it:suddenly i could see in the dashboard:which documents got retrieved for each queryexact metadata for each documenthow the llm combined different contextsreal-time alerts when mixing happened
  
  
  detection: let traceloop track your contexts

  
  
  the dashboard that changed everything
traceloop's dashboard showed me patterns i never noticed:73% of mixing happened between starter/enterprise tiersmobile/desktop mixing peaked during certain queriesspecific keywords triggered cross-context retrievalscreenshot from my actual dashboard:"reporting" queries mixed contexts 89% of the time"features" triggered enterprise doc retrieval even for basic usersaverage 3.2 contexts retrieved when mixing occurred
  
  
  prevent mixing with traced filtering

  
  
  real-time monitoring setup

  
  
  traceloop insights that blew my mind
after running for a week, traceloop showed:: 2-4pm when support team was busiest: "pricing", "features", "capabilities" queries: starter↔enterprise (67%), mobile↔desktop (23%)the evaluation dashboard revealed:faithfulness scores dropped 40% during context mixingresponse time increased 2.3x when mixing occurredcustomer satisfaction correlated with mixing frequency
  
  
  results with proper monitoring
couldn't see mixing happening40% of responses had context contaminationdebugging took hours per incidentreal-time mixing detection<3% context mixing in productioninstant alerts when mixing occurs15-minute average fix time
  
  
  quick wins with traceloop
 - literally one line - automatic tracing - track patterns - spot issues early - catch mixing in real-timethe scariest part about context mixing is you don't know it's happening. traceloop makes it visible. once you can see it, you can fix it.bonus: the traceloop dashboard impressed my manager so much, we got budget for the enterprise plan. turns out "observability" sounds way better than "i added print statements everywhere."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I just wrote a tutorial showing how to build an AI chatbot for your website that just works. https://dev.to/zachary62/the-easiest-way-to-build-an-ai-chatbot-for-your-website-full-dev-tutorial-37kp</title><link>https://dev.to/zachary62/i-just-wrote-a-tutorial-showing-how-to-build-an-ai-chatbot-for-your-website-that-just-works-5eg9</link><author>Zachary Huang</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 03:15:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI’s Invisible Hand: The Emerging Intelligence Gap in Financial Services</title><link>https://dev.to/wittycircuitry/ais-invisible-hand-the-emerging-intelligence-gap-in-financial-services-46o0</link><author>Aditya Vikram Kashyap</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 03:05:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In boardrooms across Wall Street and beyond, AI is now a fixture—discussed in every strategic offsite, featured in every quarterly roadmap. Yet, beneath the noise and novelty lies a far less visible, far more insidious challenge: the Intelligence Gap.This isn’t about machines replacing humans. It’s about some institutions accelerating faster than their industry’s cognitive center of gravity. We are witnessing the birth of a new kind of systemic risk—one not caused by capital imbalances, but by knowledge asymmetries. In this silent divergence, the firms who understand how to wield AI at scale will not just outcompete others—they’ll reshape the rules of the game before the rest realize the game has changed.The question is no longer "What can AI do for us?" but rather "What happens when only a few can afford to think at AI’s speed?"The Unseen Divide: Intelligence as Capital
In the past, financial power was hoarded through three levers: balance sheets, relationships, and regulatory mastery. Today, a fourth force is emerging—intelligence capital: the capacity to synthesize, simulate, and act on data faster than the market, the regulator, or even the client can perceive.Firms investing heavily in foundation models, proprietary data pipelines, and real-time decision infrastructure aren’t just innovating. They’re compounding knowledge. They’re building cognitive compounding loops—feedback systems that learn faster, get smarter, and deepen defensibility with every transaction.This advantage isn’t just technical. It’s temporal. When one bank simulates 10,000 credit scenarios in a day and another in a quarter, they’re not just operating at different speeds—they’re inhabiting different futures.This is the real competitive moat in financial services—and almost no one is talking about it.From Efficiency to Epistemology
Most AI conversations still revolve around optimization: faster onboarding, lower fraud rates, smarter collections. But the next frontier isn’t operational—it’s epistemological. It’s about how we know what we know.Imagine an AI that not only detects anomalies in your trade flow but also infers why they occur, simulates what if scenarios, and advises what next. These are not workflows—they are meta-workflows. They’re not just changing the outputs of financial institutions. They’re changing how financial institutions perceive risk, opportunity, and reality itself.This creates a dilemma. Because as some firms shift into AI-native cognition, the interpretive gap between the human and the machine—and between AI-mature and AI-immature firms—begins to widen. Communication frays. Coordination lags. Mispricing occurs. And over time, the market starts to fracture cognitively.We are no longer just building models. We are building epistemic engines that shape the very fabric of financial truth.The Quiet Fragility of AI Concentration
There’s another, deeper risk at play. As AI becomes more expensive to train, more reliant on proprietary data, and more integrated into real-time decision flows, it becomes concentrated—in the hands of a few global banks, tech-forward asset managers, and cloud-native fintechs.This creates a structural fragility: If too few players own the cognitive infrastructure of finance, systemic blind spots grow. Think of it like the 2008 financial crisis—not triggered by individual bad actors, but by widespread over-reliance on misprized models and assumptions.Now, imagine a future where half the global credit market is underwritten using the same few AI platforms, trained on overlapping datasets, and optimized for the same risk signals. That’s not diversification. That’s monoculture. And monocultures fail catastrophically.We are sleepwalking into cognitive concentration risk—and the industry has yet to design a framework to measure, audit, or govern it.Rethinking Regulation: From Compliance to Cognition
Our regulatory frameworks were designed to govern transactions, not intelligence. Model risk guidelines focus on inputs, outputs, and documentation—but not on learning loops, synthetic data generation, or autonomous model updates.As AI grows more self-referential—models fine-tuning themselves, agents making recursive decisions—the old paradigm of “check the model annually” becomes dangerously outdated. Supervision must shift from static validation to continuous oversight. Regulators must evolve from examiners into AI-aware risk engineers—capable of understanding how models reason, where they fail, and how to design systems for transparent cognition.If we fail to bridge this gap, we won’t just see AI failures—we’ll see governance failures that trigger reputational, legal, and systemic consequences.The Human Imperative in an AI World
Ironically, in a world dominated by machines, human judgment becomes more—not less—valuable. But the kind of judgment we need is different.We don’t need more manual reviews of output. We need people who can ask better questions of the machine. Who understand that explainability is not a tradeoff with performance—it’s the foundation of trust. Who see that AI doesn’t eliminate ambiguity; it reframes it. Who can sit at the intersection of ethics, policy, and code and say: Here’s what we can do. Here’s what we should do. And here’s what we must never do.The most strategic role in financial services over the next decade won’t be the trader or the compliance officer—it will be the AI integrator: the leader who can translate strategy into models and models into decisions.The Next Race Isn’t for Talent or Tools. It’s for Time.
Every institution today has access to AI tools. Most have talent. What separates leaders from laggards is cycle time—the time it takes to test, learn, validate, and deploy intelligence at scale.This is where legacy firms are most vulnerable—not because they lack smart people, but because their operating models are allergic to experimentation. Governance is designed to prevent failure, not learn from it. Architecture is rigid. Data is siloed. Culture is cautious.Meanwhile, the frontrunners are shortening cognitive cycles. They’re making three AI-informed decisions for every one their competitors make. Over time, that compounds. It’s not just about getting smarter. It’s about getting faster at getting smarter.That’s the race. And it’s already underway.Final Thoughts: The Future Is Unevenly Distributed—Intellectually
AI will not democratize finance. At least not at first. It will amplify the capabilities of those already positioned to use it well—and expose the gaps of those who are not.The coming decade will be defined not by who has the most data or the most dollars, but by who has the ability to turn intelligence into action responsibly, repeatedly, and at scale.The real transformation is not technical. It is institutional. And it begins with a question too few are asking:In a world of infinite intelligence, what will your firm choose to understand better than anyone else?The firms that answer this boldly—and build accordingly—will define the next era of financial services. The rest? They’ll spend the next decade trying to catch up to decisions that have already been made.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What is ChatGPT?</title><link>https://dev.to/vimukz_dezap_4c91e82c397a/what-is-chatgpt-1b2n</link><author>Vimukz dezap</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 02:46:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ChatGPT free is an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot developed by OpenAI, designed to understand and generate human-like text.

The key lies in —a fascinating concept that enables large language models (LLMs) to grasp the nuances of meaning in language. In our latest article, we delve deep into how embeddings leverage semantic similarity to transform the way AI understands and interacts with text.Consider the difference between open-ended and closed-ended models. While closed-ended models might only choose between a limited set of answers—like distinguishing between dogs and cats—open-ended models can generate a myriad of responses based on context and meaning. This flexibility is what makes embeddings so powerful; they allow models to go beyond mere word overlap and tap into the essence of language.To illustrate this, we explore methods like word overlap, where sentences can share common words yet convey entirely different meanings. For instance, while “My dog loves to eat” and “My grandma loves to eat cake” may share several words, their meanings diverge significantly. However, sentences about dogs can have a lower overlap yet remain semantically related. Curious to learn more?

  Unlocking Insights with AI: Prompt Engineering for Data Analysis
In today’s data-driven world, the ability to extract meaningful insights from vast datasets is crucial. But how do you ensure that your AI tools provide the information you need without sifting through irrelevant data? The answer lies in the art of . Just like giving precise directions to a GPS, crafting effective prompts can dramatically enhance the accuracy and relevance of the insights generated by large language models (LLMs).Imagine a retail analyst seeking to uncover sales trends. A vague request like “Show me sales data” might yield a deluge of irrelevant results. However, a well-structured prompt, such as:List monthly sales figures for product category ‘Electronics’ in Q1 2024, highlighting any growth over 10% compared to the previous quarter.
This not only clarifies the task but also streamlines the output, allowing for quicker, data-driven decision-making. Mastering prompt engineering principles is essential for anyone looking to leverage AI for data analysis. By understanding how to frame context and refine your queries, you can reduce guesswork and enhance the relevance of your outputs. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Prompt Debugging Techniques: Reduce Hallucinations &amp; Improve LLM Accuracy - Read the Full Article</title><link>https://dev.to/corpcubite/prompt-debugging-techniques-reduce-hallucinations-improve-llm-accuracy-read-the-full-article-3n4o</link><author>Cubite</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 01:50:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ever wondered why your large language model (LLM) sometimes goes off the rails? 🤔 The phenomenon of hallucinations—where LLMs generate misleading or incorrect information—can be a significant barrier to achieving reliable outputs.

The focus was image generation for presentations, articles or apps and the results were promising, even though there were spectacular failures in a few subjects. I am revisiting the exact same prompts with the "current crop" of AI generators. While the popular chat originally used DALL·E 3 exclusively, it recently switched to its 4o Image Generation for paid accounts and this is the version I will be testing (on a "Team" account). The free accounts seem to still be limited to DALL·E 3 (in addition to slow generation during peak). One image is generated per prompt. Only Microsoft Image Creator (DALL·E 3) remains unchanged since the last test — all others are new or upgraded. It is the successor to the Duet AI I was testing in the previous comparison. It is a significant improvement and the free chat plan does include image generation (with a daily limit). For this comparison I used Gemini Enterprise from within Google Slides, which uses the same engine just generates 4 images per prompt by default. I did the comparison with the Imagen 3 engine and had to redo all the Gemini images as the improved Imagen 4 was released while I was writing the report. Free for 15 image generations daily (with 4 images per prompt), using DALL·E 3. This is the only engine also used in my previous comparison, performing pretty much the same. The free Grok chat allows you 10 images per 2 hours with its Grok 3 image generation, which is quite generous and should be enough for most non-pro use cases. A single image is created per prompt.In my previous comparison I tried to recreate slide deck images I had used in various talks, app icons and header images to dev.to articles. I am using the exact same methodology to see whether there has been progress since last year.There are 12 comparison image rounds in total where all engines get the same prompts. Unlike last year, I did not tweak prompts based on results. This time I used the exact same prompts from the 2024 test for a more controlled and direct comparison.As before, each round was rated from 0 to 10 based on the proximity of the result to expectations, suitability for the intended purpose and adherence to instructions. The ratings are subjective, but the images are included so you can draw your own conclusions.For the last few years I've been giving talks at the Perl and Raku conference. My presentations always feature some sort of camel, as that's the most recognised Perl symbol, so I tried to recreate a couple of camel images I have used in the past.The simplest prompt I could think of:ChatGPT is simple and quite good - I got a cartoon, but I did not actually specify otherwise. Microsoft's is also not realistic, but kind of very specific and weird style. Gemini gives both a cartoonish and 3 realistic camels running, while Grok's don't seem to be running, and they are too zoomed-in to tell for sure.a photo-realistic happy camel running, single colour backgroundChatGPT and Gemini are pretty much what I had in mind. DALL·E is not photorealistic and Grok did not really improve at all with my second prompt, not even the background was simplified.Let's generate some scores:Google already had good results last year, but ChatGPT is added as a top performer as well.It's a bit rudimentary as I am neither a designer, nor did I want to spend much time on it. Perhaps an AI generator could have managed this with an appropriate prompt:A smiling camel looking at us through big blue glasses, single colour background, photo-realisticAt this point I feel like I was too lax with scoring last year, as I had given Duet AI a 10, while ChatGPT and Google's own Gemini are now clearly better. Grok has the issue of the glasses being a bit off center compared to the eyes, which may be realistic in how glasses would not fit a camel that well, but that's not really what we are after, is it? :)In the end I decided to retroactively adjust last year scores by -1 to show the meaningful improvement. I came close to adjusting a couple more scores, but that was a bit of a slippery slope, so in the end I adjusted only the most egregious examples (this and the sloths at the end) by -1.This slide with examples of objects as you'd view them with binoculars was going to be a long-shot:Without the "how would they look through binoculars" element, I tried to give a list of objects to see if I could get the sort of "astrophotos on canvas" style above:A compilation of photos one each of the astronomical objects: the moon, pleiades, orion nebula, andromeda galaxy, the Double Cluster,  comet Lovejoy, arranged randomly on a canvas with slight overlapsChatGPT is the only one that gets the right number of images, even though it just does repeats giving 2x Andromeda galaxies and 3x Pleiades. Grok is visually interesting, but not close to what I asked, while Google's and Microsoft's solutions have tons of not overly realistic objects, with Gemini adding some labels full of typos.Repeating last year's second attempt:A compilation of 6 photo-realistic photos, one each of the astronomical objects: the moon, pleiades, orion nebula, andromeda galaxy, the Double Cluster, comet Lovejoy, arranged randomly on a bigger canvas, some overlap is allowedGemini does probably worse than last year. Adding the label "Pleades" (sic) to something random does not make it the Pleiades... And it still cannot count. Interestingly, the previous Imagen 3 engine Gemini was using until a few days ago did a bit better. DALL*E can't do anything useful as we saw last year and Grok, again visually interesting, with realistic-looking objects, but not getting the "photos on canvas" instructions. ChatGPT actually does well, if there was no repeat of one of the 6 images, it would have been perfect.This photo is from the same presentation:4 binoculars stacked on top of each other from largest (bottom) to smallest (top), with their lens pointed towards our viewpoint, photo-realisticI think we established last year that DALL-E 3 does not understand binoculars. Add Grok to this category, the results are photorealistic but outlandish binocular-inspired depictions. Google's Imagen 4 update is a big improvement (just a few days ago I was getting results close to last year's Duet AI), with usable results. ChatGPT's latest solution gets it right on the first try.Alternative prompt with more hints:4 pairs of binoculars of various types, stacked on top of each other from largest (bottom) to smallest (top) with their lens pointing to viewer, photo-realisticI was very lenient last year with Duet AI managing to produce one usable image on the second try, ChatGPT and Gemini go far beyond by producing good results from the get go and improving with more hints. Bing and Grok are alien to the concept of binoculars.Lawn Chair Binocular MountAgain on the same slide deck, there was an image of one of the various DIY "lawn chair binocular mounts" that can be impressive and sort of amusing:They are sometimes called "bino-chairs" and require some design creativity and ingenuity, so it was a different type of test for the AI engines.man on lawn chair using hands-free binocular mountImage Creator gets a lenient 5 as it gets a sort of tripod in one of the images (but not completely hands-free). ChatGPT and Gemini gave great images, I will deduct one point from Gemini for the distinction of ChatGPT getting the "hands-free" aspect with no extra direction (Gemini gets there easily if you add to the prompt). Grok would have been spot on, if the binoculars were not the wrong way around!For technical talks, explanatory illustrations are often required. E.g. the following image from the Perceptual Image Hashing talk shows which cells of a 6x6 matrix are used for a specific hash:draw a symmetric 6x6 square matrix with white lines, make the top-left cell black, also the cells that are below the bottom-left to top-right diagonal also black, and the rest blue, 2d art styleAt this point, Grok started malfunctioning. First it started giving me images that incorporated the previous prompt for no reason:Even including "forget context" etc instructions in the prompt along with the instructions did not help, but a "Forget previous images. Start from scratch." prompt did make it exclaim it "understood" and it will start afresh, then giving me a broken image link. When I complained I can't see it, I finally got a result. Not a great result though:So, Grok, Gemini and Image Creator are trying to hard to go wildly off script. ChatGPT almost got it perfect. There's a small error about which diagonal the black squares fall under, but it's close, it even automatically switched to square format output. Going to the very basics, replacing even the word matrix with "grid" to see if the others can be helped.plain 6x6 square grid, solid colour background, vector drawingChatGPT nails it, Gemini gets it in 2 out 4 examples (for which it gets 
  
  
  Logo/Splash Graphic Design
Moving on to a couple of logos / splash screens I designed for the iOS apps I develop as a hobby. It's not typical slide deck graphics, but it could still be relevant if you are putting together a new project / product and creating a presentation for it.Polar Scope Align is an iOS app for amateur astronomers & astrophotographers. It's quite popular in its niche and it is often praised for a well-designed UI with a focus on functionality. The image assets themselves, such as icons, are rather simple as I am not a designer. Here is the older (left) and newer (right) icon of the app:Hopefully, with the right prompt, something that resembles the older & simpler icon on the left could be within the abilities of the AI engines.red crosshairs with circle around them, centered on the middle of the 7 stars of the Little Dipper, the Little Dipper should barely fit the circle, clip-art styleChatGPT gets the style very well, except in reverse colours - not sure why it went with black stars on white. It does not get the actual constellation - but no other generator did either, with Gemini being the closest in style. Grok did not do clip-art as instructed, while Image Creator is visually interesting but not close to what I was asking.solid dark blue sky, having several yellow 4-pointed stars of various sizes, each designed using hyperbolic curves, but all with their points at top/bottom/left right orientation, a third of the sky covered by a dark grey mountainous range silhouette and a big white X that is the same shape as the 4-pointed stars but rotated 45 degrees and takes up 80% of the width of the scene, clip-art styleChatGPT is the best on the first try. It got the stars and mountains right, only the X is almost, but not exactly right, going with parabolic instead of hyperbolic curves. Gemini's X is squared, so a bit worse. Grok changed its aspect ratio a bit for some reason (wider, and kept doing that for about half the subsequent tries), and gave me some weird stars and asymmetric X. Correct colours though, so I'd call it an improvement over the weird Microsoft attempt.To help Dall·E last year I had asked ChatGPT to optimize the prompt and I got this one to try:create an image of a serene landscape with a solid dark blue sky. Populate the sky with several yellow 4-pointed stars of various sizes, each designed using hyperbolic curves. Ensure that all stars have their points at top/bottom/left/right orientations. Dedicate one-third of the sky to a dark grey mountainous range silhouette. Additionally, include a prominent white X shape in the scene. The X should be the same shape as the 4-pointed stars but rotated by 45 degrees, taking up 80% of the width of the scene. The X should maintain the hyperbolic curve design.The results are mostly worse, except Gemini which gets the X with the hyperbolic curves perfectly in at least one attempt.The last attempt involved going back to the original prompt, but tweaking the description of the "X" to make it more explicit.solid dark blue sky, having several yellow 4-pointed stars of various sizes, each designed using hyperbolic curves, but all with their points at top/bottom/left right orientation, a third of the sky covered by a dark grey mountainous range silhouette, at the foreground a big white X that is also designed using hyperbolic curves and takes up 80% of the width of the scene, clip-art styleIt actually did worse than the original here, except Gemini which is at a similar level and Dall·E which is a small improvement.After all these quite specific images, I thought I'd try more creative generation and see what the AI engines can come up with when given titles of articles - dev.to articles I've posted to be exact.First, is the performance review of the latest AMD EPYC powered GCP instances. I did a simplified title last year as Duet AI was getting confused, I'll repeat the same:An image that can serve as a title for a Google Cloud and AMD EPYC presentationYou'll notice I say "title", when I really should have said "header" or similar. I did not notice, as the image generators did not take it literally in the last comparison - possibly because they were lousy with text. Here comes ChatGPT 4o though:Text looks good and, interestingly, the top half is kind of what I went with myself. However, I will change "title" to "header" for this comparison, as I had expected some sort of graphics would be included:ChatGPT gave a very simple design, but it is just right, even getting Google's logo and the EPYC font right. Gemini is trying harder to impress, but modifies logos etc in the process. It does know a header image should be on a wide aspect ratio. Image Creator is an improvement from last year, no garbage text. Grok is just uninspired - generic. I'll base the points to what I gave Image Creator last year (I was a bit lenient again).Compute Cloud Provider Comparisonan image that can be used as a header in a compute cloud provider price & performance comparisonChatGPT is again a simple design, gets the text right and the drawing is very on point. Gemini is usable as long as it does not try to add too much text, at which point we start getting gems like "COMPANES" (sic). Image Creator is similar to last year, no text attempted so usable results although a bit too "imaginative. Grok decided to give me a single image for the first time, and it's not great, as there are some weird typos in the title and the chart even weirder.For this article a generic prompt was attempted:Header image for blog post: "AI Image Creation: ChatGPT vs Gemini vs DALL·E 3 vs Grok"ChatGPT was reasonably clear, the others rather disappointing, although Grok did get most of the text OK - these too were the only ones that could spell . Gemini and DALL·E could not spell anything. Since I didn't get good results, I gave more explicit prompts, such as asking for a painter writing a different phrase for each engine on a canvas:painter writing [name of ai service] on a canvas.ChatGPT does well as usual, a bit artistic output. Gemini is great, with realistic images and correct spelling / Google logo. Microsoft's service gets the spelling of "Microsoft" slightly off in 2/4 tries. Grok gives me one version before the painter has written anything. Maybe it's intended as "progression"?I'll give average marks from the two attempts above (and the separate marks in parenthesis next to them).Finally, I tried something fun for my videoconferencing background. First thing that came to my mind was:sloths wearing headphones, photo-realisticGemini and Grok gave me what I wanted. Some playful, reasonably realistic sloths (plural) wearing headphones. ChatGPT gave me what looks like the passport photo sheet of a single sloth, not really natural or much realistic. Image Creator also had trouble with plural, half the attempts featured a single sloth. I did award a 10/10 last year, this is the second case I am revisiting to subtract 1, as I was too lenient and this year’s top two performers clearly improved upon last year's best:Let's take a look at the cumulative scores:This year's follow-up confirms that AI image generation tools have made noticeable progress - from sub-50% scores, we got to at least one solution (subjectively) scoring over 90%.The top performer is ChatGPT, the new 4o model is the most dependable of all the solutions. It is the only one that can count, do technical drawings and the only one that has fully solved text rendering, while being the best at interpreting prompts. It went with the "less is more" approach, often giving the simplest, yet most appropriate image. It's the only one though that is not accessible in a free version. That may be just for now though, as it's quite new.Gemini (Imagen 4) marked a clear improvement over last year’s Duet AI. It can mostly render text (not yet consistently) and can finally draw multiple binoculars without merging them into a monstrosity. It still has problems counting (with perhaps a small improvement over Duet AI) and misses fine prompt details, but it's available even on the free version. Plus, its integration into the Google Docs suite is a nice convenience.Microsoft's Image Creator seems to use pretty much the same (DALL·E 3) engine like last year. It actually got lower marks, possibly due to luck - I only used the results of the first attempt, so some luck is involved. It's still good for creative results, but it's not accurate, can't do text, so it's rather limited for serious uses.Grok (Grok 3) showed promise with photorealistic visuals and some artistic "flair", but was the most inconsistent, occasionally misinterpreting prompts, producing malformed compositions, or displaying contextual confusion.Re-running the exact same 12 test rounds as last year highlighted that prompt interpretation, factual accuracy and visual clarity remain difficult to balance across models. Some were good in freeform design, others in precision, but none yet do both equally well, although ChatGPT got close. Still, the overall quality is clearly up from 2024.So, for most professional use cases, especially when accuracy matters, ChatGPT 4o can provide great results, with Gemini being a decent alternative most of the time. Image Creator remains a decent free option for creative use, while Grok does show some interesting potential - it often goes a different way compared to the others.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Operator Pattern</title><link>https://dev.to/minwook/operator-pattern-3fin</link><author>제민욱</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 00:59:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[: A specialized controller used to manage a custom resource.

  🔍 Understanding Human-AI Orthogonality
In mathematics, orthogonal vectors point in completely different directions—they're independent, don't interfere with each other, yet together they can describe any point in space.  applies this same principle to team collaboration.
  
  
  📊 Traditional vs. Orthogonal AI IntegrationTraditional AI IntegrationOrthogonal AI IntegrationOverlapping, unclear boundariesDistinct, well-defined domainsBoth human and AI can override each otherClear escalation paths and final authoritiesRedundant checking, wasted effortComplementary validation strategies"Who's responsible?" confusionDuplicated work, bottlenecksParallel processing, optimal flow
  
  
  🎯 The Four Pillars of Human-AI OrthogonalityEach party operates in their zone of maximum effectiveness without overlap.Define when each party takes action to avoid conflicts.Clear escalation paths and final decision makers.Structured communication channels for continuous improvement.Gray zones are areas where responsibility is unclear, leading to: - Both human and AI work on the same task - Each party assumes the other will handle it - No clear authority to make final calls - Inconsistent validation standards
  
  
  🚨 Common Gray Zone ScenariosScenario 1: The Code Review Paradox: Human assumes AI validated business logic; AI generated code without business context understanding.Scenario 2: The Security Blind SpotScenario 3: The Performance Mystery

  🏢 Organizational Resistance & Change Management
The biggest challenge in implementing human-AI orthogonality isn't technical—it's organizational. Even with perfect frameworks and clear policies, teams often struggle with the human dynamics of change.
  
  
  🚧 Common Resistance Patterns"If AI handles code generation, what's my value as a developer?": Fear of obsolescence and unclear career progression paths.
  
  
  2. The Management Control Paradox"How can I manage what I don't understand?"Many managers struggle with AI integration because they can't evaluate or direct AI work using traditional management approaches.
  
  
  3. The "It's Always Worked Before" InertiaOrganizations resist changing processes that have historically been successful, even when AI could improve them.
  
  
  🔄 Change Management Strategies for OrthogonalityPhase 1: Foundation Building (Months 1-2)Phase 2: Pilot Success & Learning (Months 3-4)Focus on creating early wins and building organizational confidence.Phase 3: Scaled Implementation (Months 5-8)Expand to additional teams while refining processes based on pilot learnings.
  
  
  📊 Bootstrapping Baseline MeasurementsOne of the biggest challenges is establishing baseline metrics when teams are just beginning orthogonal practices. Here's a practical approach:
  
  
  🎯 Conflict Resolution: When Optimal Design Meets Organizational RealitySometimes the optimal orthogonal design conflicts with existing organizational structures. Here's how to navigate these challenges:
  
  
  🔧 Practical Implementation: The 30-60-90 Day PlanBased on real-world experience, here's a realistic timeline for orthogonality implementation:Days 1-30: Assessment & Quick WinsComplete team assessment using provided templateIdentify 3-5 clear gray zones causing immediate painImplement simple gatekeeping policies for low-risk scenariosBegin baseline measurement collectionDays 31-60: Framework ImplementationDeploy hybrid RACI matrix for core development activitiesTrain team on new collaboration patternsEstablish monitoring and feedback mechanismsAddress first wave of resistance with coachingDays 61-90: Optimization & ScalingRefine policies based on real-world usageExpand to additional team activitiesMeasure and communicate success metricsPlan expansion to other teamsThe feedback from readers has been incredible, especially around the organizational challenges of implementing these frameworks. Here are some questions that came up:"How do you handle the senior developer who's convinced AI will make them obsolete?""What metrics do you track when you don't have historical AI data?""How do you deal with managers who want to approve every AI decision?"
Having implemented orthogonal AI practices across multiple organizations, the biggest surprise was that technical challenges were rarely the blocker—it was always the human dynamics. The most successful implementations started with addressing fears and resistance head-on, rather than focusing purely on technical frameworks.What organizational resistance have you encountered with AI integration?How do you handle conflicts between optimal AI design and existing team structures?What baseline metrics worked best for your team's starting point?Have you found effective ways to address the "turf war" mentality around AI?Join the discussion with #AIOrthogonality #HumanAICollaboration #DevOps

  🏗️ What Is AI Technical Debt?
Traditional technical debt is the cost of choosing a quick-and-dirty solution now that will require more work later. AI technical debt has all the same problems, plus some uniquely modern complications:
  
  
  📊 The Classic Definition vs. AI RealityTraditional Technical Debt: Human shortcuts under pressure: AI suggestions accepted without full understanding: Usually obvious to experienced developers: Hidden behind sophisticated-looking code: Accumulates gradually over months/years: Can accumulate rapidly in days/weeks: Often undocumented but understandable: May be documented but not truly understood: Requires refactoring familiar patterns: Requires learning and then refactoring unfamiliar patterns
  
  
  🔍 The Four Pillars of AI Technical Debt
  
  
  1. AI models evolve rapidly. Code generated by GPT-3.5 patterns may look outdated compared to GPT-4 best practices, even within the same year.AI often suggests libraries you've never heard of, creating a sprawling dependency tree that's hard to audit and maintain.
  
  
  3. Different AI models (or even the same model on different days) can suggest different patterns for similar problems, creating inconsistent code styles across your codebase.Perhaps the most dangerous: code that works but isn't understood by anyone on the team.AI technical debt doesn't just affect code—it impacts your entire team. Here's how:: As AI introduces complex, unfamiliar code, team members may struggle to understand each other's work, leading to silos and duplicated effort.: New developers face a steep learning curve, not just to understand the code, but to grasp the underlying AI models and their quirks.Increased Reliance on Key Individuals: If only a few team members understand the AI-generated code, it creates bottlenecks and single points of failure.
  
  
  👥 AI Debt and Team Dynamics
Before diving into technical solutions, let's address the elephant in the room: AI technical debt isn't just a code problem—it's a team problem.
  
  
  🤝 The Collective Knowledge GapTraditional technical debt usually involves shortcuts that experienced developers can recognize and address. AI debt creates a different challenge: sophisticated-looking code that nobody on the team truly understands.: How many people on your team can confidently explain what this function does and modify it safely? If the answer is "none" or "maybe one person," you've found AI debt.
  
  
  🔄 AI Debt and Code Review DynamicsAI-generated code changes the entire code review process:: Logic, style, performance: Understanding + all traditional concerns: 15-30 minutes per PR: 30-60 minutes per PR: "Is this the right approach?": "What does this even do?": Domain knowledge sufficient: Domain + AI pattern recognition needed: High confidence in assessment: Uncertainty about hidden implicationsTrack these collaborative indicators to identify AI debt impact on your team:
  
  
  🎯 Establish team standards specifically for AI-generated code: [ ] : What does this code do in plain English?
 [ ] : Why was this specific approach chosen?
 [ ] : Are all imported libraries familiar to the team?
 [ ] : Could this be simpler?

 [ ] : AI generation context and reasoning documented
 [ ] : Comprehensive tests that demonstrate understanding
 [ ] : At least 2 team members comfortable making changes
 [ ] : Clear strategy for troubleshooting if issues arise

 [ ] : Acceptable complexity for long-term maintenance
 [ ] : How will new team members learn this code?
 [ ] : How will this code be updated as requirements change?
 [ ] : Can this be replaced/simplified if needed?

  
  
  ⏰ The Temporal Nature of AI Debt
AI technical debt doesn't just accumulate—it ages like fine wine that turns to vinegar. Understanding the temporal patterns of AI debt is crucial for long-term maintenance strategy.Here's how AI-generated code typically degrades over time:Week 1-4: 🟢 "Honeymoon Phase"
├── Code works as expected
├── Original context still fresh in team memory
├── Dependencies are current
└── Performance meets requirements

Month 2-6: 🟡 "Reality Setting In"
├── First maintenance requests reveal complexity
├── Original team members start forgetting AI context
├── Some dependencies show minor version conflicts  
└── Edge cases not covered by AI emerge

Month 6-12: 🟠 "Accumulation Phase"
├── Dependencies require updates, breaking changes appear
├── AI model patterns become "legacy" as newer models emerge
├── Team knowledge attrition accelerates
└── Maintenance velocity noticeably slows

Year 2+: 🔴 "Crisis Phase"
├── Major refactoring needed but too risky to undertake
├── New features become exponentially more difficult
├── Security updates require deep understanding nobody has
└── Team actively avoids modifying AI-generated modules

  🧠 The Psychology of AI Debt
The most insidious aspect of AI technical debt isn't technical—it's psychological. Our mental models and cognitive biases create blind spots that make AI debt harder to recognize and address.
  
  
  🎭 The Cognitive Biases That Create AI Debt
  
  
  1. "This code looks so sophisticated, it must be good."AI generates code that often appears more advanced than what most developers would write. This creates a bias where complexity is mistaken for quality."The AI suggested it, so it must be the right approach."We tend to defer to AI suggestions even when simpler solutions would work better."We've already invested time in this AI-generated solution."Once AI generates working code, teams become reluctant to replace it, even when simpler alternatives emerge.
  
  
  4. The Not-Invented-Here Inverse Bias"Since we didn't write it, it must be better than what we would have written."Traditional NIH bias makes teams reject external solutions. With AI, this flips—teams assume AI solutions are superior to their own approaches.
  
  
  🛡️ Psychological Defense Strategies
  
  
  1. Before accepting any AI-generated code, require a team member to explain it in plain English to a non-technical person.
  
  
  2. For every AI suggestion, challenge the team to write a simpler version. Compare both versions across multiple dimensions:Ask: "Will my team six months from now thank me for accepting this AI suggestion, or curse me?"
  
  
  4. The Bus Factor Reality CheckAI-generated code often has a bus factor of zero—if the person who accepted the AI suggestion leaves, nobody understands the code.
  
  
  🎯 Mental Model Shifts for AI Debt Management
  
  
  From: "AI generates better code"

  
  
  To: "AI generates different code that requires different evaluation criteria"

  
  
  From: "Working code is good code"

  
  
  To: "Working code that nobody understands is technical debt"

  
  
  From: "AI saves development time"

  
  
  To: "AI trades development time for maintenance complexity"

  
  
  From: "Complex-looking code is sophisticated"

  
  
  To: "Simple, understandable code is sophisticated"

  Securing AI's Frontier: A Developer's Handbook to Confidential Computing for Machine Learning
The rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has brought unprecedented capabilities, but it has also amplified critical concerns around data privacy, intellectual property, and model security. While traditional security measures effectively protect data at rest (storage) and in transit (network), a significant vulnerability remains: data in use. This is where sensitive training datasets, proprietary AI models, and inference results are actively being processed, leaving them exposed to insider threats, sophisticated attacks, or compromised cloud environments. Confidential Computing (CC) emerges as the vital missing piece, offering a robust solution to protect these critical assets during their most vulnerable phase.As highlighted by the Linux Foundation, Confidential Computing is revolutionizing data security, compliance, and innovation by securing data in use, especially in the context of AI, cloud computing, and multi-party data collaboration. The increasing migration of AI workloads to the cloud, driven by the substantial cost of AI hardware, further underscores the urgent need for CC to safeguard AI models and their inputs/outputs.
  
  
  Key Concepts in Practice: Demystifying the Enclave
At the heart of Confidential Computing are Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), hardware-based secure enclaves that isolate sensitive computations from the rest of the system, including the operating system, hypervisor, and even cloud administrators. Technologies like Intel SGX, AMD SEV, and AWS Nitro Enclaves implement these TEEs, ensuring that data and code remain protected even during execution.Within a TEE, data is encrypted, and operations are performed in an isolated environment, meaning no unauthorized entity, not even privileged system software, can view or tamper with the data or code within.  is a crucial mechanism that allows a remote party to cryptographically verify that the TEE is legitimate, running the expected code, and in a secure state before sensitive data or models are loaded. This provides a high degree of trust in the execution environment, a critical component for developers building secure AI pipelines.
  
  
  Practical Use Cases: AI Secured by Confidential Computing
The real-world applications of Confidential Computing in AI are transformative, enabling new paradigms for secure data collaboration and model protection:Federated Learning with Sensitive Data: Federated learning allows multiple parties to collaboratively train a machine learning model without directly sharing their raw data. However, the model updates themselves can sometimes leak sensitive information. By performing the aggregation of these model updates within a confidential computing enclave, the privacy of individual participants' data is further enhanced. This is particularly crucial in sectors like healthcare, where patient data privacy is paramount, enabling secure data aggregation for better patient outcomes and research. Protecting the intellectual property of AI models during inference is vital, especially when models are deployed in untrusted environments or offered as a service. Confidential computing allows the model and the inference process to run within a TEE, preventing unauthorized access to the model's weights and architecture, and ensuring the confidentiality of the input data and output predictions. This protects proprietary algorithms from theft and guarantees data privacy for users.Privacy-Preserving AI Analytics: Analyzing highly sensitive datasets, such as financial transactions or healthcare records, often presents a dilemma between extracting valuable insights and maintaining strict data confidentiality. Confidential computing enables organizations to run AI analytics on encrypted data within a TEE, ensuring that the data remains protected throughout the analysis lifecycle. This unlocks new opportunities for data monetization and collaborative research without compromising privacy regulations like GDPR or HIPAA.
  
  
  Implementation Roadblocks & Solutions for Developers
While the benefits are clear, integrating Confidential Computing into existing AI workflows presents several challenges for developers:Data Preparation and Ingress/Egress: Securely getting sensitive data into and out of the TEE is a critical step. This often involves secure channels, cryptographic key management, and careful design to minimize data exposure outside the enclave. Solutions often involve encrypting data before it enters the TEE and decrypting it only within the trusted environment.Tooling and Framework Compatibility: The current landscape of popular ML frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch was not originally designed with TEEs in mind. This means developers often need to use specialized SDKs or adapt their existing code to interact with the confidential environment. The Confidential Computing Consortium is working to foster an ecosystem of compatible tools and frameworks. You can learn more about the ongoing advancements in confidential computing at exploring-confidential-computing.pages.dev.Performance Considerations: The isolation mechanisms within TEEs can introduce computational overhead, leading to increased latency and reduced throughput. This is particularly problematic for high-performance AI workloads that rely heavily on GPU acceleration, which is often not natively supported in many current TEEs. Ongoing research focuses on optimizing memory management, expanding TEE computational capabilities, and designing new architectures that support secure GPU integration.Debugging and Monitoring: The inherent opacity of TEEs, designed to prevent external observation, makes traditional debugging and monitoring challenging. Developers need specialized tools and strategies to troubleshoot issues within the opaque enclave, often relying on secure logging and remote attestation for verification.
  
  
  Code Examples (Conceptual)
While full runnable code is beyond the scope of an article, here are conceptual snippets illustrating how an ML model might be secured within an enclave:Sealing an ML Model within an Enclave (Pseudo-code):// Assume a confidential computing SDK is initialized
ConfidentialComputeSDK sdk = new ConfidentialComputeSDK();

// Load the pre-trained ML model
Model myModel = ModelLoader.load("path/to/my_model.pb");

// Define the entry point for model execution within the enclave
EnclaveFunction inferenceFunction = (inputData) => {
    // Decrypt input data if necessary
    SecureData decryptedInput = sdk.decrypt(inputData);

    // Perform inference using the model
    PredictionResult result = myModel.predict(decryptedInput);

    // Encrypt the result before sending it out
    SecureData encryptedResult = sdk.encrypt(result);
    return encryptedResult;
};

// Seal the model and the inference function into the enclave
Enclave myEnclave = sdk.createEnclave(inferenceFunction, myModel.weights);

// Attest the enclave to a remote party
AttestationReport report = myEnclave.attest();
Basic Data Encryption/Decryption within a TEE Context (Conceptual):// Inside the secure enclave
class SecureDataProcessor {
    private SecretKey enclaveKey;

    public SecureDataProcessor(SecretKey key) {
        this.enclaveKey = key; // Key derived securely within the TEE
    }

    public byte[] decryptData(byte[] encryptedData) {
        // Use TEE-protected cryptographic functions
        return TEE_API.decrypt(encryptedData, this.enclaveKey);
    }

    public byte[] encryptData(byte[] plainData) {
        // Use TEE-protected cryptographic functions
        return TEE_API.encrypt(plainData, this.enclaveKey);
    }
}
An overview of a confidential AI SDK would typically involve APIs for:Enclave Creation and Management: Functions to initialize, load, and manage the lifecycle of secure enclaves. Methods for securely ingesting and egressing data, often involving encryption/decryption. APIs to generate and verify attestation reports, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the enclave. Mechanisms to store sensitive data (e.g., model weights, cryptographic keys) securely within the enclave.Integration with ML Frameworks: Adapters or plugins to allow popular ML frameworks to operate within the TEE.
  
  
  Future Outlook: The Evolving Landscape of Confidential AI
Confidential computing is poised for significant expansion, especially in industries with stringent data protection requirements. The future promises further advancements, moving from process-level enclaves to full virtual machine-level isolation, exemplified by technologies like Intel's Trust Domain Extensions (TDX) and AMD's Secure Encrypted Virtualization with Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP). These innovations provide broader protection to entire guest operating systems and their memory, aligning better with cloud-native and multi-tenant deployment models.The integration of advanced cryptographic techniques like zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and homomorphic encryption with TEEs will further enhance secure computation on encrypted or distributed data, even outside the enclave boundary. As AI models become more sophisticated and handle increasingly sensitive data, the need for robust "in-use" protection will only intensify. The convergence of AI and confidential computing is not just a trend; it's a fundamental shift towards a more secure and privacy-preserving future for artificial intelligence.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Detect and Reduce Hallucinations in a LangChain RAG Pipeline in Production</title><link>https://dev.to/thepracticaldeveloper/detect-and-reduce-hallucinations-in-a-langchain-rag-pipeline-in-production-3cln</link><author>Practical Developer</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 23:49:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
Traceloop auto-instruments your LangChain RAG pipeline, exports spans via OpenTelemetry, and ships ready-made Grafana dashboards. Turn on the built-in Faithfulness and QA Relevancy monitors in the Traceloop UI, import the dashboards, and set a simple alert (e.g., > 5 % flagged spans in 5 min) to catch and reduce hallucinations in production, no custom evaluator code required.  
  
  
  Q: What causes hallucinations in RAG pipelines?

Hallucinations occur when an LLM generates plausible but incorrect answers due to:: Irrelevant or outdated documents returned by the retriever.
: The LLM fabricates details when it has low internal confidence.
: Source documents, user intents, or prompts evolve over time, so
previously reliable context no longer aligns with the question.
  
  
  Q: How can I instrument my LangChain pipeline with Traceloop?
Install SDKs (plus LangChain dependencies you use):   pip traceloop-sdk langchain-openai langchain-core
Build and run your LangChain RAG pipeline: Add hallucination monitoring in the UI. Use the Traceloop dashboard to configure hallucination detection.
  
  
  Q: What does a sample Traceloop trace look like?
 A Traceloop span (exported over OTLP/Tempo, Datadog, New Relic, etc.) typically contains:High-level metadata – trace-ID, span-ID, name, timestamps and status, as defined by OpenTelemetry.
Request details – the user’s question or prompt plus any model/request parameters.
Retrieved context – the documents or vector chunks your retriever returned.
Model output – the completion or answer text.
Quality metrics added by Traceloop monitors – numeric Faithfulness and QA Relevancy scores plus boolean flags indicating whether each score breached its threshold.
Custom tags – any extra attributes you attach (user IDs, experiment names, etc.), which ride along like standard OpenTelemetry span attributes.Because these fields are stored as regular span attributes, you can query them in Grafana Tempo, Datadog, Honeycomb, or any OTLP-compatible back-end exactly the same way you query latency or error-rate attributes.
  
  
  Q: How do I visualize and alert on hallucination events?
: Traceloop ships JSON dashboards for Grafana in /openllmetry/integrations/grafana/. Import them (Grafana → Dashboards → Import) and you’ll immediately see panels for faithfulness score, QA relevancy score, and standard latency/error metrics.:
Grafana lets you alert on any span attribute that Traceloop exports through OTLP/Tempo. A common rule is:Fire when the ratio of spans where  OR  is 1 exceeds 5% in the last 5 min.
You create that rule in Alerting → Alert rules → +New and attach a notification channel.:
Grafana supports many contact points out of the box:Alerting → Contact points → +Add → Slack. Docs walk through webhook setup and test-fire.Same path; choose  as the contact-point type (Grafana’s alert docs list it alongside Slack).If you use Grafana OnCall, you can configure Slack mentions or paging policies there.Traceloop itself exposes the flags as span attributes, so any  backend (Datadog, New Relic, etc.) can host identical rules.: Use time-series panels to chart  and .
  
  
  Q: How can I reduce hallucinations in production?
-Filter low-similarity docs:  Discard retrieved chunks whose vector or re-ranker score is below a set threshold so the LLM only sees highly relevant evidence, sharply lowering hallucination risk.
-Augment prompts: Place the retrieved passages inside the system prompt and tell the model to answer strictly from that context, a tactic shown to boost faithfulness scores. 
-Run nightly golden-dataset regressions: Re-execute a trusted set of Q-and-A pairs every night and alert on any new faithfulness or relevancy flags to catch regressions early.
-Retrain the retriever on flagged cases: Feed queries whose answers were flagged as unfaithful back into the retriever (as hard negatives or new positives) and fine-tune it periodically to improve future recall quality. 
  
  
  Q: What’s a quick production checklist?
Instrument code with  so every LangChain call emits OpenTelemetry spans.Verify traces export to your back-end (Traceloop Cloud, Grafana Tempo, Datadog, etc.) via the standard OTLP endpoint.Import the ready-made Grafana JSON dashboards located in 'openllmetry/integrations/grafana/'; they ship panels for faithfulness score, QA relevancy score, latency, and error rate.Create built-in monitors in the Traceloop UI for Faithfulness and QA Relevancy (these replace the older “entropy/similarity” evaluators).Add alert rules (e.g.  OR  > 5 % in last 5 min)
Route alerts to Slack, PagerDuty, or any webhook via Grafana’s Contact Points.Automate nightly golden-dataset replays (a fixed set of Q&A pairs) and fail the job if new faithfulness/relevancy flags appear. Periodically fine-tune or retrain your retriever with questions that produced low scores, improving future recall quality.Bake the checklist into CI/CD (unit test: SDK init → trace present; integration test: golden replay passes; deployment test: alerts wired).Keep a reference repo — Traceloop maintains an example “RAG Hallucination Detection” project you can fork to see all of the above in code.
  
  
  Frequently Asked Questions
Q: How can I detect hallucinations in a LangChain RAG pipeline? Instrument your code with  and turn on the built-in Faithfulness and QA Relevancy monitors, which automatically flag spans whose  or  equals true in Traceloop’s dashboard.Q: Can I alert on hallucination spikes in production? Yes—import Traceloop’s Grafana JSON dashboards and create an alert rule such as: fire when  OR  is true for > 5% of spans in the last 5 minutes, then route the notification to Slack or PagerDuty through Grafana contact points.Q: What starting thresholds make sense? Many teams begin by flagging spans when the  dips below approximately 0.80 or the  falls below approximately 0.75—use these as ballpark values and then fine-tune them after reviewing real-world false positives in your own data.Q: How do I reduce hallucinations once they’re detected? Reduce hallucinations by discarding or reranking low-similarity context before generation, explicitly grounding the prompt with the high-quality passages that remain, and retraining or fine-tuning the retriever on the queries that were flagged. your LangChain RAG pipeline with  Traceloop’s built-in  and  monitors the ready-made Grafana dashboards and wired alerts on flagged spans a nightly golden-dataset replay to catch silent regressions – Drive simulated traffic and verify that spans, scores, and alerts
behave as expected before cutting over to production.
 – Adjust faithfulness/relevancy cut-offs (e.g., start at 0.80 / 0.75) after
reviewing a week of false-positives and misses.
Add domain-specific monitors – Create custom checks such as “must cite internal
knowledge-base documents” or “answer must include price.”
 – Feed flagged queries back into your retriever (hard negatives or new
positives) to tighten future recall quality.

GitHub Copilot suggests a complex JWT validation function. It looks sophisticated, handles edge cases you hadn't even considered, and—best of all—it passes all your tests on the first try. You accept the suggestion, push to production, and move on to the next task. Three months later, you're debugging a security breach. The root cause? That "perfect" JWT function had a subtle timing attack vulnerability that your tests never caught. You stare at the code, realizing you never actually understood what it was doing. 😱Welcome to programming by coincidence in the AI era—where code that "just works" can be more dangerous than code that obviously breaks.
  
  
  🎲 What Is Programming by Coincidence?
Programming by coincidence is when your code works, but you don't understand  it works. In the pre-AI world, this usually happened through trial-and-error debugging: you'd keep changing things until the tests passed, without grasping the underlying logic.AI autocompletion has supercharged this phenomenon. Now you can get sophisticated, working code without understanding it at all. The AI does the "trial and error" invisibly, presenting you with solutions that seem perfect but might hide critical flaws.: When you don't understand your code, you can't:Debug it effectively when it breaksModify it safely when requirements change
Spot security vulnerabilities or performance issuesExplain it to team members or in code reviewsMake informed decisions about technical debt
  
  
  ⚠️ The Hidden Dangers of AI-Assisted Programming by Coincidence
Let me share some real examples I've encountered (anonymized for obvious reasons):: Sophisticated hash comparison with rate limiting.What was actually happening: A textbook timing attack vulnerability that leaks information about the correct hash through response times.: Smart caching that should improve performance.What was actually happening: O(n) database calls disguised as caching, because the cache only worked within a single function call. When user_ids grew from 100 to 10,000, the function went from 2 seconds to 5 minutes.: Robust order calculation with edge case handling.What was actually happening: The  masked serious data integrity issues. When items had negative quantities (returns) or negative prices (credits), the function silently returned $0 instead of the correct negative total, breaking accounting reconciliation.
  
  
  🚀 The Real Value of AI Autocompletion
Before we throw AI under the bus, let's acknowledge where it genuinely shines:
  
  
  ✅ Legitimate AI Autocompletion Wins: Generating standard CRUD operations, common patterns, and repetitive code structures: Suggesting correct syntax for well-documented APIs and libraries: Creating comprehensive test cases based on function signatures: Writing clear docstrings and inline comments: Suggesting consistent naming and structure improvements
  
  
  📈 According to GitHub's 2024 developer survey, developers using Copilot report:55% faster task completion for routine coding tasks looking up documentation for architecture and design thinkingBut here's the catch: 88% of developers admit they don't fully understand at least some of the AI-generated code they've used in production.
  
  
  🎯 The 5-Point Decision Framework for AI Suggestions
Here's my practical framework for deciding when to accept AI autocompletion:
  
  
  📊 Quick Reference Decision MatrixCan I explain how this works?I can teach it to someone elseI get the general idea but need researchI have no idea what this doesCan I write comprehensive tests?I can test all edge casesI can test the happy pathI can't think of meaningful testsCan I document the behavior?I can document behavior and edge casesI can document main functionalityI can't explain what it's supposed to doDo I understand the performance implications?I understand complexity and resource usageNo clue about performance implicationsHave I considered security implications?I've evaluated security risksThis needs security reviewPotential security concerns I can't evaluate

  💡 Best Practices for AI-Assisted Development

  
  
  🔄 The Understand-Then-Accept WorkflowRead the suggestion completely before accepting with sample inputsIdentify potential edge cases and failure modes if they don't existResearch unfamiliar patterns or librariesDocument your understanding in comments
  
  
  ⏰ The Hidden Technical Debt TimelineAI-generated code often creates a unique form of technical debt that compounds over time:: Code works perfectly, tests pass, everyone's happy: First edge case appears, requires deep debugging of unfamiliar patterns: Performance issues emerge under production load: Security audit reveals vulnerabilities in AI-generated crypto code: Major refactoring needed, but no one remembers how the AI code works

  🧠 After Understanding and Improving
  
  
  🤝 Building Team AI Literacy: The Collective Approach
The individual framework is crucial, but the real transformation happens at the team level. Here's how to build collective intelligence around AI-assisted development:
  
  
  📋 Establish team-specific guidelines for reviewing AI-generated code: [ ] I can explain this code's logic to a colleague
 [ ] I've written tests that verify the behavior, not just the output
 [ ] I've documented any AI-generated patterns or algorithms used
 [ ] I've verified this doesn't introduce security or performance regressions

 [ ] The code follows our team's complexity guidelines
 [ ] Critical business logic is clearly documented and understood
 [ ] Any cryptographic or security-sensitive code has been flagged for expert review
 [ ] Performance implications are understood and acceptable

  
  
  🧠 Knowledge Sharing RitualsWeekly AI Learning Sessions: Teams share interesting AI suggestions they rejected and why: Review AI-generated code from 3+ months ago—do we still understand it?: Identify patterns in AI suggestions that consistently need modification
  
  
  📈 Track team-level indicators of healthy AI usage:: Percentage of AI suggestions the team can fully explain: How often AI suggestions require significant changes: Which bugs trace back to poorly understood AI code: Average time spent reviewing AI-generated vs. human-written code
  
  
  🔮 The Future of AI-Human Code Collaboration
The goal isn't to avoid AI autocompletion—it's to use it intelligently:: Boilerplate, syntax, common patterns, initial implementationsKeep humans responsible for: Architecture decisions, security reviews, business logic validation, edge case analysis
  
  
  📚 Continuous Learning ApproachTreat AI suggestions as learning opportunities: Each suggestion is a chance to understand a new pattern or approach: Understanding how AI tools work makes you better at evaluating their output: Document and share your AI evaluation processes with your team
  
  
  💬 Your Turn: Building Sustainable AI Development Practices
The balance between AI assistance and human understanding isn't just individual—it's cultural, temporal, and psychological. Here are some questions to help you and your team navigate this new reality:Personal Reflection Questions:What percentage of your daily code do you accept from AI suggestions?How do you currently validate AI-generated code before using it?What's the most complex AI-suggested code you've used in production?Have you ever been bitten by code you didn't fully understand?When do you feel the "sophistication bias" most strongly?:Should we establish team standards for accepting AI suggestions?How can we balance productivity gains with long-term code comprehension?What's our process for reviewing AI-generated code in pull requests?How do we handle the "AI debt" accumulating in our codebase?What psychological safeguards can we build into our development process?:Are we measuring the right metrics for AI-assisted development?How do we ensure knowledge transfer when AI-generated code becomes legacy?What's our strategy for maintaining code quality as AI usage increases?Implement the 5-point decision framework on your next 3 AI suggestionsTry the "Teaching Test" on one piece of AI-generated code in your current projectAudit one significant AI-generated function in your codebase—do you still understand it?Implement AI code review standards with your teamRun the AI debt detection analysis on your codebaseEstablish team guidelines for AI-assisted developmentSet up knowledge sharing rituals around AI learningRemember: The goal isn't to be suspicious of AI—it's to be intentional, informed, and collectively intelligent about when and how you use it.In our next commandment, we'll explore the critical skill of prompt engineering for developers: how to communicate effectively with AI tools to get better code suggestions and avoid common pitfalls.: What's your approach to balancing AI assistance with code understanding?

You type a question in plain English — “Do you sell gluten-free options?” or “When’s the next open day?” — and the site just answers. That’s exactly what  by Microsoft enables.But this isn’t “just another chatbot.” It’s a whole new way of making the , using open standards and something called an .Let’s break it down in simple terms, with real-world examples — and explain why NLWeb is a . (short for ) is an open-source framework that lets websites become AI-friendly out of the box.Instead of you having to build a custom chatbot, train it with your data, and host a service, NLWeb exposes your site’s content in a standard format so that  can read and talk to it — safely and smartly.At its core is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server — a lightweight interface that lets AI agents understand and query your site’s content, similar to how APIs work, but made for AI.💬 How Is NLWeb Different From a Regular Chatbot?✅ Yes – you build & train it❌ No – reuses your existing structured dataHandles structured queries like AI agents?Tightly bound to a specific AI?✅ Often (e.g. OpenAI plugin, RAG)❌ Works with any AI or agent✅ Schema.org, RSS, JSON-LD, etc.Automatically discoverable?✅ Yes – other systems can auto-query your MCP serverSo instead of building a chatbot  your site, NLWeb lets your site itself “speak AI.”Real-World Example 1: A Local Bakery Website:To let AI answer "Do you sell vegan cupcakes?", you'd need to:Train it with product data.:You just expose your existing menu using Schema.org data, install an MCP server, and  — your site can now respond to that question directly from the browser, AI assistant, or even a voice interface.Bonus: NLWeb Makes Your Site By setting up your MCP server (which NLWeb helps with), you’re not just helping your site talk to visitors — you're enabling external AI agents to query your site too.A personal AI assistant asks, “When is my local recycling center open?”Instead of going to Google, it directly queries your city council's website — because it has an NLWeb MCP server.Your site becomes part of the AI-driven web.You don’t need to manually integrate with every AI tool — they come to you.🔐 Do I Have to Give Up Control?Nope. You control what data is exposed and how it’s formatted. You can choose:What pages or datasets to make available.Which AI systems or bots can access it.Whether to rate-limit or secure access.It's your site, your rules — just smarter.🔧 Getting Started (for Devs)If you're technical, here’s how you can explore:Add structured data to your site (Schema.org, JSON-LD, etc.).Configure what content you want to expose.That’s it — you’re ready to be “AI-accessible.”This is the flow from client to server:Final Thoughts: Why NLWeb MattersNLWeb is like HTML for the AI age.

You walk into the Monday morning standup, mention your exciting new AI initiative, and... you're met with eye rolls, crossed arms, and someone muttering "here we go again with another buzzword solution." 😒Sound familiar? You've just encountered the : the technology that promises to augment human capabilities often faces the strongest human resistance.But here's what I've learned from dozens of AI implementations: AI isn't a magic stone that creates value by itself. Like the classic folk tale of Stone Soup, AI only becomes valuable when everyone contributes their ingredients—data, domain knowledge, feedback, and most importantly, genuine collaboration.
  
  
  📖 The Stone Soup Story: A Perfect AI Metaphor
If you haven't heard the Stone Soup folk tale, here's the quick version: A hungry traveler comes to a village claiming he can make delicious soup from just a stone and water. Curious villagers gather around. "It's almost perfect," he says, "but it could use just a carrot." Someone brings a carrot. "Now just needs an onion..." Soon everyone has contributed something, and together they've created a feast that no one could have made alone.This is exactly how successful AI adoption works. 🎯The "stone" (your AI tool) is just the catalyst. The real magic happens when: contribute clean, relevant datasets 📊 provide business context and validation 🧠 offer real-world feedback and edge cases 👥 ensure integration and security 🔧 provides support and resources 📈Without these contributions, your AI is just an expensive rock sitting in digital water.
  
  
  🚫 Why Teams Resist AI: The Real Barriers
After implementing AI in over 20 organizations, I've identified the most common sources of resistance:: "Will AI replace me?": "I don't understand this technology": "How do I trust a black box with my decisions?": Complex jargon and overwhelming documentationLack of relevant training: Generic AI courses that don't address specific roles: All theory, no practical application: "Another new tool we have to learn?": No time allocated for learning and adoption: Performance metrics don't reward AI experimentation: Failed tech rollouts create skepticismUnclear value proposition: Can't see how AI helps their specific work: Can't explain AI decisions to customers or stakeholdersReal talk: Most AI resistance isn't about the technology—it's about how the change is being managed. 💀
  
  
  🥄 The Stone Soup Methodology for AI Adoption
Based on successful implementations across industries, here's my proven framework for turning AI resistance into AI champions:
  
  
  📋 Quick Reference: 5-Phase Stone Soup AI AdoptionIdentify 3 use cases, validate with stakeholdersClear business case definedFind champions, create communication channelsActive champion network establishedEach team contributes their expertiseAll teams actively participatingIterate based on feedbackWeekly improvements, monthly health checksSuccess stories, metrics dashboards3+ teams requesting expansion
  
  
  🎯 Phase 1: Choose Your Stone (Start Small & Strategic)
: Find a low-risk, high-visibility use case that demonstrates quick value.: AI-assisted ticket routing or FAQ suggestions: Automated report generation or anomaly detection
: Email templates or documentation assistance: Workflow automation or predictive maintenanceMission-critical systems right awayComplex, multi-team integrationsUse cases requiring significant behavior changeProjects without clear success metrics: A retail company I worked with started with AI-powered inventory alerts for just one product category in one store. Simple, measurable, low-risk. Six months later, they had AI across their entire supply chain.
  
  
  👥 Phase 2: Gather Your Villagers (Build Your Coalition)
: Identify and involve key stakeholders who can contribute and influence others. about new technology and share experiences across different teamsTrain your champions to become internal coaches who can:Answer day-to-day questionsIdentify and escalate issuesProvide peer-to-peer support
  
  
  📢 Establish Communication Channels: Open Q&A sessions: Real-time support and knowledge sharing: Teams demo their AI wins: Share tips, successes, and lessons learned
  
  
  🥕 Phase 3: Collect Ingredients (Incremental Value Building)
: Let each person/team contribute what they can, building value incrementally.Here's what different teams typically contribute:• Data quality improvements• Feature engineering• Use case validation• Output interpretation• Edge case identification• Usability testing• Workflow optimization• Success metrics definition• Security implementation• Integration support• Priority setting• Resource allocation
  
  
  🔄 Phase 4: Season and Taste (Iterate Based on Feedback)
: Continuously improve based on real usage and feedback.Monday: Collect usage data and user feedback
Tuesday: Prioritize improvements and bug fixes  
Wednesday: Implement high-impact changes
Thursday: Test and validate improvements
Friday: Deploy updates and communicate changes
: Who's using it? How often?: Time saved? Quality improved? Errors reduced?: What's working? What's frustrating?: Which teams want to try it next?
  
  
  🎉 Phase 5: Share the Feast (Scale and Celebrate)
: Scale successful patterns while maintaining momentum and engagement.: Feature teams who've achieved great results: Make improvements visible and measurable: Let teams present their AI innovations: Acknowledge champions and early adopters
  
  
  💻 Real Implementation: Customer Service AI Adoption
Let me show you how this works in practice with a real example from a SaaS company I helped implement AI customer service tools:
  
  
  🎯 : AI-Powered Ticket Classification
Instead of trying to replace customer service reps, we started with a simple tool that automatically categorized incoming support tickets.
  
  
  👥 : How Each Team Contributed
 (skeptical at first):: Historical ticket data and category labels: "AI will make mistakes and confuse customers": Made AI suggestions optional with easy override: 40% faster ticket routing, agents felt empowered not replaced: Data cleaning and model improvement: Identified patterns humans missed: Model accuracy improved from 72% to 89% over 3 months: Integration requirements and UX feedback: "This will slow down our roadmap": Built integration in 2-week sprint with existing tools: Became advocates and requested AI for their own workflows (results-focused):: Budget approval and policy support: 30% reduction in response time, 95% agent satisfaction: Approved AI expansion to other departments
  
  
  📊 : Stone Soup Success Metrics
✅  among support agents✅ 30% faster ticket resolution time✅  with AI assistance✅  requesting AI tools✅  about AI involvement

  🎯 Enhanced Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

  
  
  ❌ The "Magic Stone" Mistake: Expecting AI to deliver value without organizational change: Focus on the collaboration and process improvement, not just the technology: Trying to implement AI everywhere at once: Start with one small, successful implementation and build from there
  
  
  ❌ The "Chef's Special" Fallacy: Having AI experts build solutions in isolation: Involve end users in every step of design and implementation
  
  
  ❌ The "Recipe Hoarding" Issue: Not sharing knowledge and success patterns across teams: Create visible knowledge sharing channels and celebrate contributions
  
  
  ❌ The "Cultural Mismatch" Trap: Applying a one-size-fits-all approach across different cultural contexts: Adapt the Stone Soup approach to local cultural values and decision-making styles (see Cultural Diversity section below)
  
  
  ❌ The "Failure Denial" Syndrome: Continuing failed pilots instead of learning and pivoting: Set clear failure criteria upfront and treat failures as learning opportunities (see Failed AI Pilots section below)
  
  
  ❌ The "Silent Treatment" Problem: Not communicating AI changes and impacts clearly to all stakeholders: Create transparent communication channels and regular updates on AI progress
  
  
  🌍 Cultural Diversity in AI Adoption
The Stone Soup approach isn't one-size-fits-all. Cultural context significantly impacts how teams respond to AI adoption. Here's how to adapt your strategy:
  
  
  🗾 Global Cultural Adaptations (Japan, Korea, Arab countries)
: Emphasize relationship-building and consensus before introducing AI: Use longer preparation phases with extensive stakeholder consultation: "Let's thoroughly understand how AI will affect our team harmony before implementation" (USA, Germany, Netherlands)
: Focus on direct benefits and efficiency gains: Present clear ROI data and quick wins: "Here's the 30% productivity improvement we can achieve in 60 days" (India, Thailand, Mexico)
: Secure leadership buy-in first, then cascade down: Start with management champions before engaging individual contributors: "Once the senior manager approved AI tools, the entire team followed" (Scandinavia, Australia, Canada)
: Use collaborative decision-making and peer influence: Create cross-functional AI adoption committees: "Everyone has a voice in how we implement AI tools"
  
  
  🏢 Enterprise-Specific Cultural ConsiderationsInnovation-Driven Organizations: Emphasize AI as competitive advantage: "AI-first culture", "cutting-edge solutions", "market leadership": Speed of adoption and experimentationRisk-Averse Organizations (Financial services, Healthcare)
: Focus on compliance, security, and gradual implementation: "Risk mitigation", "regulatory compliance", "proven solutions": Error reduction and audit trail completenessPeople-Centric Organizations (Non-profits, Education)
: Emphasize human augmentation, not replacement: "Empowering our mission", "freeing time for meaningful work": Employee satisfaction and mission impact
  
  
  📉 Learning from Failed AI Pilots
Understanding failure patterns helps prevent common pitfalls and accelerates recovery when things go wrong.
  
  
  🚨 Common AI Pilot Failure PatternsThe "Shiny Object" Syndrome: Choosing trendy AI without clear business case: Vague success metrics, technology-first thinking: Refocus on specific business problems AI can solveThe "Data Desert" Problem: Assuming data is ready when it's not: Poor data quality, missing historical data: Invest in data infrastructure before AI implementationThe "Perfectionist Paralysis": Waiting for perfect AI solution before deployment: Endless model tuning, no user feedback: Deploy "good enough" solution and iterate: AI team working separately from business users: Low adoption, user complaints, missed requirements: Embed AI team with business users

Background agents help take on  I’ve found them useful for documentation, light refactoring, and implementing small features.To get started, you can usually use a short prompt to pre-create a plan that Jules will partially follow (in reality, it will recreate the plan, but having references will make it easier):Please write a condensed plan for an AI Agent so it can execute it step by step. Make sure that the plan has only one final goal; otherwise, ask the user what to do.
Make sure that the plan contains original links to sources, a chosen configuration script, and is written in a way that allows for one-click copy & paste.This plan can be created in any AI chat, but when working with the plan, it’s advisable to specify the project/documentation the agent will be working with.

Initially, Jules (like Cursor background agents and Codex) runs in an isolated environment. Since Dart & Flutter are typically not present in the container, they need to be forcibly installed before starting work on a project. By declaring this in the initial prompt, we provide clearer instructions on how the agent should act, which enables it to complete the task with higher quality.I hope this concept proves useful :-)Please share your thoughts in the comments :-) This will help make this article visible to others and will be great support and motivation :-)Thank you for your time and have a good day!

However, the increasing sophistication of AI models often comes at the cost of transparency, leading to the "black box" problem where decisions are made without clear, human-understandable reasoning. Explainable AI (XAI) emerges not merely as a tool for demystifying AI, but as a critical enabler for a deeper, more effective human-AI collaboration. This goes beyond simply building trust; it's about empowering humans to actively participate in, oversee, and optimize AI-driven processes, transforming AI from a mere tool into an intelligent co-pilot.
  
  
  XAI as a "Co-Pilot" for Human Experts
In high-stakes domains, human expertise remains indispensable. XAI acts as a sophisticated co-pilot, providing insights that allow human experts to leverage AI's computational power and pattern recognition capabilities while retaining their critical oversight and domain knowledge. Consider a doctor using an AI system for disease diagnosis. Instead of a simple "diagnosis: condition X," an XAI-powered system might highlight specific imaging features, patient symptoms, or lab results that most influenced the AI's conclusion. It could flag anomalies that warrant a closer look, suggest potential biases in the data that might affect the AI's output, or even propose alternative diagnoses with their respective supporting evidence for human review. This collaborative approach enhances diagnostic accuracy, reduces the risk of errors, and ensures that the human expert remains in control, using the AI's insights to make more informed decisions.Similarly, in finance, an AI might predict market trends or identify fraudulent transactions. With XAI, a financial analyst can understand  a particular transaction was flagged as suspicious – perhaps due to an unusual location, transaction amount, or recipient. This insight allows the analyst to investigate efficiently, rather than blindly trusting or distrusting the AI's alert. The integration of XAI into these workflows transforms AI from an opaque decision-maker into a transparent, insightful partner, augmenting human capabilities rather than replacing them.
  
  
  Interactive XAI: Beyond Static Explanations
The initial iterations of XAI often provided static explanations – a report or a visualization that presented the AI's reasoning post-hoc. However, the future of XAI lies in its interactivity. Imagine a scenario where users can not only view explanations but also query, probe, and refine AI models based on the insights provided. This shift moves towards dynamic, conversational interfaces that allow users to ask "why," "what if," or "what else?" questions.For instance, visual XAI tools could allow users to manipulate input features and immediately see how the AI's prediction changes and why. Natural language interfaces, increasingly powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are proving to be particularly promising in this regard. As explored in research like "LLMs for XAI: Future Directions for Explaining Explanations" by Burton et al. (2024) [https://arxiv.org/html/2405.06064v1], LLMs can transform complex, technical explanations generated by algorithms like SHAP into human-readable narratives, providing context and making the AI's reasoning far more accessible to non-technical domain experts. This enables a more intuitive and iterative process of understanding and refining AI behavior. For more insights into the evolving landscape of XAI, exploring resources like the Explainable AI XAI Insights can provide valuable context.
  
  
  XAI for AI Development and Debugging
XAI is not just for end-users; it's becoming an indispensable tool for AI developers themselves. During the development lifecycle, XAI helps in identifying and rectifying biases, improving model robustness, and optimizing performance. When a model performs unexpectedly or exhibits unfair behavior, XAI techniques can pinpoint which features or data points are contributing to these issues.For example, if a facial recognition AI shows bias against certain demographic groups, XAI can reveal whether the bias stems from underrepresentation in the training data or from specific feature interpretations by the model. This allows developers to surgically address these problems, rather than resorting to trial-and-error. By providing clear insights into the model's internal workings, XAI accelerates the debugging process, leading to more reliable, fair, and performant AI systems. The "Rise of Explainable AI (XAI): A Critical Trend for 2025 and Beyond" [https://blog.algoanalytics.com/2025/05/05/the-rise-of-explainable-ai-xai-a-critical-trend-for-2025-and-beyond/] highlights how XAI is crucial for AI governance and adoption, making it vital for developers to integrate it into their workflows.
  
  
  The Ethical Imperative of Collaborative XAI
Ethical considerations are paramount in the age of AI. When humans and AI collaborate on critical tasks, XAI plays a crucial role in ensuring accountability and fairness. If an AI system makes a decision with significant real-world consequences (e.g., loan approval, medical treatment recommendation), XAI provides the necessary transparency to understand the basis of that decision. This allows for human oversight and intervention, ensuring that ethical guidelines are met and that individuals are not adversely affected by opaque algorithmic judgments. XAI facilitates a shared understanding of responsibilities, making it clear when the human expert is leveraging the AI's insights and when they are exercising their independent judgment. This collaborative accountability framework is essential for building public trust and ensuring the responsible deployment of AI technologies.
  
  
  Code Examples for a Technical Audience
For those delving into the technical aspects, here are conceptual examples illustrating how XAI techniques can be applied:LIME/SHAP for Local Interpretability:
These techniques explain individual predictions of complex models.Counterfactual Explanations:
These explain what minimum changes to the input would alter an AI's decision.Integrating XAI into a Human-in-the-Loop System:
A conceptual snippet showing how an XAI explanation could trigger a human review.The future of AI is not about machines operating in isolation, but about intelligent collaboration with humans. Explainable AI is the cornerstone of this future, moving beyond mere transparency to enable a dynamic partnership. By providing clear, interactive, and actionable insights into AI's decision-making, XAI empowers human experts to become true co-pilots, enhancing their capabilities, improving decision quality, and fostering accountability. As AI continues to permeate every aspect of our lives, the focus on collaborative XAI will be paramount, ensuring that these powerful technologies are developed and deployed responsibly, ethically, and in harmony with human intelligence.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Every Crypto App Needs a Reliable Blockchain API in 2025</title><link>https://dev.to/api_builder_01/why-every-crypto-app-needs-a-reliable-blockchain-api-in-2025-4jjp</link><author>api_builder_01</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 21:57:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Blockchain technology underpins every aspect of crypto. Whether you’re building a wallet, DeFi app, NFT marketplace, DAO tool, or analytics dashboard, your application needs access to on-chain data: transactions, balances, block history, token contracts, and more.In 2025, relying on a reliable blockchain API isn’t optional—it’s the foundation of every Web3 product. Without it, you can’t track wallets, interact with smart contracts, or verify on-chain activity. Whether you’re indexing data, triggering smart contract actions, or monitoring user funds, your API is what connects you to the blockchain.This article explains why blockchain APIs are mission-critical, what types you need, and how platforms like Token Metrics API supplement them with AI-driven context and trading intelligence.What Is a Blockchain API?
A blockchain API provides structured access to data stored on a blockchain. Instead of running your own node and querying it manually, you can use an API to:Interact with smart contractsQuery DeFi positions or NFTsThese APIs abstract away the complexity of blockchain nodes and let you focus on building user-facing features.Types of Blockchain APIs Your App May Need
API Type
Node Access API
Lets you read/write to the blockchain (e.g. Infura)
Indexing API
Organizes on-chain data for faster access (e.g. Covalent, Alchemy)
Transaction API
Fetches wallet transfers, token interactions, etc.
Contract Interaction API
Lets your app call smart contract functions
Token Price + Signal API
Provides real-time token data + trading signalsWhy Raw Blockchain APIs Aren’t Enough
Raw blockchain APIs are great for:
Reading wallets and blocksBut they don’t tell you why something matters or whether to take action.
That’s where complementary APIs like Token Metrics come in—layering on trading intelligence, sentiment, and market signals on top of blockchain data.How Token Metrics Complements Blockchain APIs
Use a blockchain API to get the “what.” Use Token Metrics to get the “so what.”Example Use Case: Wallet Analysis App
Fetch token balances from Ethereum wallets via Alchemy or CovalentCall Token Metrics /token/grades for each token🔥 Trader Grade (is this token still strong?)⚠️ Sentiment warning (bearish mood?)💡 Signal: Bullish or Bearish todayThis creates a richer, smarter user experience.Why Reliability Is Critical
When your blockchain API fails, your app breaks. That can mean:Dashboards display outdated dataSmart contracts aren’t monitored properlyIn 2025, users expect real-time accuracy, especially in high-volatility markets. Your infrastructure must be battle-tested and reliable.Look for:
🔄 High uptime (>99.99%)🧠 Indexed data (not raw logs)Top Blockchain API Providers in 2025
Provider
Example Use
Developer-first tools, multi-chain
Covalent
Great for token balances, NFTs
Portfolio apps
Industry-standard Ethereum access
Moralis
Game + Web3 builder tools
Login, auth, balance
Performance + multi-chain support
Token Metrics
Not a node provider—adds trading intelligence
Signal analytics, AI dashboardsHow to Combine Blockchain APIs with Token Metrics
Let’s say you're building a DeFi dashboard.
Covalent or QuickNode to pull wallet holdings and transaction history✅ Support/resistance levelsThis gives users not just a snapshot of what they own, but a real-time opinion on those holdings.Use Covalent to fetch token balances: ETH, OP, RNDRUse Token Metrics API:

Dashboard shows:
OP – Bullish 🔥 | Trader Grade: 86 | Sentiment: Positive | Resistance: $3.20What This Means for Builders
If you're building:Token listing engines
 ...you need both blockchain APIs and intelligence APIs like Token Metrics.One shows data. The other shows opportunity.Token Metrics API: Add the Alpha Layer
You don’t need to build your own AI models. The Token Metrics API gives you:
✅ Trader & Investor Grades✅ Resistance/Support Levels✅ 5,000 Free Monthly API CallsUse it with your existing on-chain data pipeline.Blockchain APIs are essential to access the decentralized web—but on their own, they’re not enough. To create crypto products that inform, guide, and convert, you need insight on top of data.That’s where Token Metrics API delivers. By combining raw blockchain access with smart trading intelligence, you can build crypto apps that help users act—not just observe.In 2025, the winning formula is simple:
 ✅ Use Covalent/Alchemy/QuickNode for on-chain data
 ✅ Use Token Metrics for AI signals, risk scores, and real-time alpha]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Isn’t the Story.

Sometimes it just rolls on in. Quietly. No parade. No keynote. Just this stubbornly little drift you only notice if you're looking.This is where we are now with financial services. There is no banner headline shouting "BREAKING: INDUSTRY TRANSFORMED." But beneath the jargon and panels, something is real in terms of how we conceptualize innovation. And yes, it's kind of a big deal.I’ve had a front-row seat to this slow-motion evolution. Between leading innovation efforts, trading notes with startups and regulators, and listening to enterprise leaders grapple with AI and agility over coffee (sometimes multiple coffees), I’ve realized: the biggest breakthroughs aren’t always technical.They’re philosophical. Cultural. Sometimes even emotional. (Yes, emotional. Innovation is messy. Ask anyone who's tried to modernize a legacy system without weeping.)We talk about AI like it's the headliner—and rightly so, because it's everywhere now. From onboarding processes to risk models, AI is performing more thankless tasks than ever before. And here's the shocker: the magic isn't inside the model. It's inside the environment.Who built it? Who governed it? Who developed it right?That's where the term "ecosystems" comes in. And don't tune out just yet—yeah, I know, cliche.But bear with me. When it's done well, an ecosystem is not a buzzword. It's actually kind of a smart way of saying, "Hey, we probably can't do this alone."And that's pleasant. Let's try again.The best examples? They're below the radar. JPMorgan's IndexGPT wasn't assembled by some solo genius - it was co-creation. UBS's synthetic analyst bots? Built by cross-fertilizing old-school financial know-how with OpenAI expertise. MAS in Singapore? They've perfected co-creation with industry and academia as a national sport (and we should be taking a page from them).It's all backed up by this: openness. These projects aren't about empires-building. They're about collaborating on blueprints. Abandoning perfection. Getting the unlikely partners in the same room—and maybe even allowing them to hold the whiteboard marker.In this new universe, the winners aren't the glitziest-teched, deepest-pocketed. They're those who can orchestrate. Less "command and control," more "conduct the symphony."And not disorder, no. It signifies another style of leadership. One that is comfortable with complexity. One that wagers on platforms rather than fortresses. One that worries less about short-term ego scores and more about long-term resilience.So no, this is not some puff blog post drifting around in hysteria or a warning story. It's just an observation.A reminder. That maybe the future of finance will not be so much about moonshot-ing, and so much about well-crafted collaborations that actually function.And seriously? That does sound like progress.Let me know if you agree? Would love to know what you think and as Innovators, Developers and Techies what appealed to you most? ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>This AI Prompt Finds Your Team’s Matches and Plans the Whole Trip for You</title><link>https://dev.to/protik_49/this-ai-prompt-finds-your-teams-matches-and-plans-the-whole-trip-for-you-2cg5</link><author>Touhidul Islam Protik</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 21:20:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I built an AI travel assistant for sports fans that automatically collects all upcoming matches of their favorite soccer team happening within a chosen time window.

I get irritated every time!!For many enterprise developers, the command-line (shell) is still the fastest and most direct way to get things done. New tools are now bringing AI into this familiar environment: shell-based coding agents run right in your terminal, offering natural-language code assistance without dragging you out of your workflow. In short, shell-based agents supercharge the tools you already use. I’ve always loved the command line; it gives me a kind of direct control over my environment that you just don’t get with most tools. That’s why shell agents click with me. They don’t try to replace the way I work; they just build on top of it, making the commands I already use smarter and more powerful.Shell-based agents start working the moment you open your terminal. By design, terminal tools launch nearly instantaneously, often in sub-50 millisecond startup times. So you spend virtually no time waiting. For example, Forgecode’s highlights that its AI-enabled shell “provides sub-50ms startup” and direct system access. This means the agent is ready to help before an IDE even finishes its splash screen. Terminal interfaces also provide “direct, high-bandwidth interaction with the computing environment”, so the agent can execute commands (like compiles or tests) at native speed. In practice, this lightning-fast startup and direct access greatly reduces friction: you can issue a prompt or shell command and immediately see results. Forge also supports Parallel Workflows and seamless Git worktree integration, so you can split tasks across multiple branches or sessions without overhead.Because the agent runs locally in your terminal, even heavy operations (like scanning a large codebase) can happen very quickly. In a continuous integration or cloud environment, this efficiency matters: dozens of shell-agent instances can share the same server with minimal impact, whereas the same machine could only support a few heavy [IDE] processesThe shell carries your entire project context along with it, so a coding agent can “see” everything you see. Your current directory, file structure, environment variables, and installed tools are all immediately in scope. With that context, the AI doesn’t have to guess at file paths or configuration details; it knows exactly where your code and resources are. The Forgecode emphasise that this leads to more accurate results: the rich context “makes AI interactions more accurate and relevant because the AI understands your environment just as you do”.Shell agents also inherit your shell’s environment settings automatically. They see your PATH, version manager configurations, and any container or virtual environment you’ve loaded. For instance, if you’re on Python 3.313 via pyenv or inside a Docker container, the agent picks that up immediately. It even knows your current Git branch and environment variables like NODE_ENV or DATABASE_URL. As a result, the AI won’t accidentally run code in the wrong interpreter or miss a critical setting, everything matches your actual environment.One of the shell’s greatest strengths is its mature ecosystem of command-line tools and shell-based agents that tap directly into it. The CLI gives you immediate access to powerful, battle-tested utilities like grep, awk, sed, find, ripgrep, jq, git, and many more. A shell AI agent can leverage these tools instead of reinventing their functionality. For example, Forgecode demonstrates combining an AI query with traditional UNIX text-processing commands:forge "Find all TODO comments in JavaScript files" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nrIn this pipeline, the AI-generated results flow through sort and uniq just like any other command’s output. Because these tools follow consistent conventions (taking input from and writing output to streams), the agent’s output can seamlessly feed into your existing workflows (and vice versa). This means your AI assistant automatically gains the power of any CLI tool or script you already use. For instance, if you have a custom code formatter or linter in your workflow, the shell agent can simply call it as part of its sequence.Rather than locking developers into a fixed GUI, shell agents encourage using the best tool for each task and chaining them together. Because a shell agent runs with the same privileges as you, it can do things IDE-based tools cannot. For example, it can launch compilers, run tests, or spin up containers directly. You could ask the agent to “build the Docker image” or “run the unit tests with code coverage,” and it will execute those exact commands under the hood. This deep integration ensures the AI assistant truly acts as an extension of your environment rather than a separate silo.Shell-based agents naturally embrace the Unix philosophy of composability: programs do one thing well and can be chained together. As Douglas McIlroy said, Unix programs should be written so that “the output of every program can become the input to another, as yet unknown, program”. In practice, this means you can string the agent together with other commands to solve complex problems. For example, you could pipe a list of files to the agent for analysis and then filter the results with grep or awk to hone in on specific issues. Forgecode highlights this synergy: their shell-based approach “eliminates context switching, leverages established tools, and provides a fast, flexible interface”. By following this time-tested model, a shell agent remains flexible and modular, letting you combine it with any other CLI step in your workflow.You can also weave the agent’s output into larger shell scripts. The agent becomes just another filter or transformer in your pipeline. For example, you might write a one-liner that finds all files containing a certain error, passes them through the agent for explanation, and then logs the result. You can use shell features like globbing (*.js), redirection (> results.txt), or even loops to process the agent’s answers. In this way, a shell agent fits neatly into existing automation scripts or continuous-integration pipelines, giving you more power and expressiveness than a monolithic IDE interface.A text-based shell interface is extremely lightweight compared to modern IDEs. Because it runs in the terminal, even a feature-rich agent has very low overhead. According to Forgecode “Low Resource Usage: minimal impact on system performance”. In contrast, a full IDE can consume hundreds of megabytes of RAM or more, even when idle. In one user benchmark, Neovim (a terminal editor) used only about 10 MB of RAM, whereas Visual Studio Code (an Electron-based IDE) used roughly 700 MB with no files open. The savings add up quickly: even a hundred developers using shell agents could free up many gigabytes of memory compared to the same number running heavy IDE instances. In practice, a shell agent like Forge leaves almost all CPU and RAM free for your code compilation and tests. In a cloud or CI/CD pipeline, this efficiency translates directly into cost savings. You can run more parallel analyses or smaller instances when the tools are light. Over time, those saved resources mean lower infrastructure bills for large teams.
  
  
  6. Developer-Centric Control
Shell-based agents respect the developer’s autonomy and expertise. They expose each step they take (just as normal shell commands do) and invite you to refine or approve actions. Using a shell agent feels like collaborating with a teammate in the terminal, rather than outsourcing tasks to a black box. In a shell environment, you can inspect and modify every command the agent runs. For example, if the AI suggests a code change via a script or regex, you see exactly what it does (and can tweak or undo it). This transparency means nothing happens without your knowledge. The developer remains in control: you issue the query, then fine-tune or approve the AI’s suggestions, rather than being bound to a hidden process.For enterprise teams, this transparency is also important for security and compliance. Every action the shell agent takes appears in your shell history or logs, just like any other command. Teams can audit and review AI-driven changes as usual, without any hidden background processes. This auditability is often required in regulated environments, giving organizations confidence that AI assistance won’t create unseen side effects.
  
  
  Shell(Terminal)vs. IDE-Based Agents: Trade-offs for Enterprise Developers
To put these points in context, consider how shell agents stack up against AI assistants built into IDEs (such as GitHub Copilot or Replit’s Ghostwriter). IDE agents shine when you want inline code suggestions as you type or tight integration with a particular editor. They offer intuitive GUI support for code completion, debugging panes, and visual diff tools. However, they come with trade‑offs.IDE agents must load a complex interface and often run in a browser or large desktop app, so they start slower and use more resources. They typically only see what’s currently in your editor – not the entire filesystem – and their scope may be limited by the IDE’s own context (open files, project setup, etc.). In contrast, a shell agent gives you full project context and immediate feedback on terminal commands. When Forge directly compares the two, it notes that a shell agent has “full access to the local environment” while IDE/web tools are “limited to uploaded files”.Shell tools also encourage a more keyboard‑driven workflow, whereas IDE extensions can force you into menu interactions and multiple clicks. On the flip side, IDE agents may be more approachable for beginners (offering GUI wizards and inline hints), and they integrate naturally with graphical debugging and version control UIs. The best choice often depends on your team’s style: do you prefer a mouse‑driven GUI experience, or do you relish scripting and terminals? In any case, these approaches are complementary. Enterprise teams might well use Copilot for quick in-editor completions and a CLI agent for automated scripts and larger refactorings.Regardless, the bottom line is clear: shell‑based agents excel in raw speed, context and flexibility, while IDE‑based agents excel in polished UI integration. As one developer blog puts it, using a CLI agent lets you work “without ever opening an IDE,” streamlining tasks that would otherwise require multiple UI interactions. By understanding the strengths and limitations of each approach, teams can deploy both to maximize productivity.And if you like what you see, ⭐ Star our GitHup repo to stay in the loop and support the project!Shell-based coding agents are quietly redefining how enterprise development gets done. By weaving AI directly into the terminal, they deliver instant startup, deep context, and seamless integration with the tools developers already know and trust.

This isn't about passively accepting whatever Copilot suggests—it's about being an  rather than just an AI consumer.When I see duplicate code generated, my first instinct isn't to immediately refactor. Instead, I  to understand the context and guide better generation:Instead of accepting duplication blindly:Try prompt engineering first:// My prompt: "I already have a validateUser function above. 
// Can you reuse it or create a more specific validation for this context?"

  
  
  🗣️ Effective AI Guidance Prompts
Here are the prompts I use to guide my AI when I spot duplication:1. Reference Existing Code"There's already an auth function at line 45. Can you reuse that instead?"
2. Request Contextual Differentiation"This looks similar to the user validation above. How should payment validation differ?"
3. Ask for Abstraction Analysis"I see duplicate validation logic. Should these be combined or kept separate for different services?"
"This auth code is similar to what we have. What makes this context different?"

  
  
  📊 When AI Guidance Works vs. When to Accept Duplication
Same file, similar function"Reuse the existing function above"Different business contexts"How does this differ from the existing one?""Can we abstract this pattern?"Complex configuration needed"Show me the differences"
  
  
  🎓 The Meta-Skill: AI Conversation Design
The real skill isn't just writing prompts—it's  with your AI. Think of it as pair programming, but your pair doesn't remember the last 10 minutes unless you remind them.Example conversation flow:You: "Generate user authentication for the payments service"
AI: [Generates standard auth function]
You: "This is similar to the user service auth above. What should be different for payments?"
AI: [Explains context differences and generates payment-specific validation]
You: "Perfect. Now show me how to test both scenarios"
This approach often reveals whether duplication is  (different business contexts) or  (AI lack of context awareness).
  
  
  📚 DRY: The Rule We All Learned (And Maybe Learned Too Well)
If you've read  (and if you haven't, go fix that 📖), you know DRY stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself." Hunt and Thomas taught us that every piece of knowledge should have a single, authoritative representation in our system.And honestly? It's been great advice for 25 years. DRY gave us:: Change once, fix everywhere: No more hunting down that one function that does validation slightly differently: Fewer places for things to go wrongBut here's the thing—DRY also creates coupling 🔗. And if you're building microservices in 2025, coupling is basically kryptonite ☢️.
  
  
  🤖 Why AI Changes Everything (And I Mean Everything)
Working with AI assistants like GitHub Copilot has completely flipped the script on duplication. Here's what I've noticed in my own projects:
  
  
  ⚡ "Just Generate It Again"
Remember spending an hour crafting the perfect abstraction? Now my AI can regenerate that validation logic in 30 seconds. The math has changed—sometimes it's faster to just ask for a new version than to understand and modify an existing abstraction.
  
  
  🤷‍♂️ AI Doesn't Know Your Codebase
Your AI assistant is brilliant at patterns, but it doesn't know about that  class you wrote six months ago. It'll happily generate new code instead of reusing existing modules. Fighting this feels like swimming upstream 🏊‍♂️.
  
  
  🏃‍♂️💨 Teams Move at Different Speeds
When your user service team needs to ship GDPR compliance changes while your billing team is still figuring out PCI requirements, shared code becomes a coordination nightmare 😱.Let me show you three real scenarios where I've actually been  my AI generated duplicate code:
  
  
  🔧 Scenario 1: "Why Won't This Shared Validator Work?"
My AI generated input validation for user registration across three services. Each service had  different requirements. I spent two hours trying to make a generic validator that could handle all three cases. The result? A mess of configuration flags and optional parameters that nobody on my team could understand without reading the implementation.
  
  
  🚰 Scenario 2: "The ETL That Couldn't Be Shared"
Similar data transformation logic across multiple ETL pipelines, but each one had weird edge cases for different data sources. Every time I tried to abstract it, I ended up with callback hell or configuration objects that were longer than the original functions.
  
  
  📡 Scenario 3: "API Responses That Look Similar But Aren't"
Three different endpoints that format responses in similar ways, but with service-specific metadata, error codes, and business logic. The shared formatter became this frankenstein 🧟‍♂️ of conditional logic that was harder to understand than just having three focused functions.Sound familiar? If you've been working with AI-generated code, I bet you've hit these exact situations.

💡 PRINCIPLE: Optimize for team velocity, not code elegance

  
  
  🔍 My 5-Question "Should I DRY This?" Checklist
After getting burned by premature abstraction one too many times 🔥, I developed this simple checklist. When my AI generates duplicate code, I ask myself these five questions:: Different teams, different repos, different deploy schedules: Same team, same codebase, releases happen togetherReal talk: Cross-team shared code is a coordination nightmare. I learned this the hard way. 💀
  
  
  2. 🔄 Will This Logic Evolve Differently?: Each instance will likely change for different business reasons: Changes will always happen in lockstepUser management auth rules change differently than payment processing rules. Always. 🏦 vs 👤
  
  
  3. 🧩 How Complex Would the Abstraction Be?: You'd need config objects, callbacks, or feature flags: The shared function would be genuinely simplerIf your abstraction needs a README to explain how to use it, you've gone too far. 📄➡️😵
  
  
  4. ⚡ Can AI Regenerate This Faster Than I Can Modify It?: "Just ask Copilot" is faster than "figure out the shared utility": The abstraction is so simple that modification is trivialThis one still feels weird to me, but it's true. Sometimes regeneration beats refactoring. 🤯
  
  
  5. 🐛 Which Approach Makes Debugging Easier?: Service-specific functions give clearer stack traces and test scenarios: Centralized logic would actually simplify troubleshootingWhen your payment processing fails at 2 AM 🌙, you want obvious, focused functions, not a generic validator with 20 configuration options.
  
  
  💻 Real Code Examples: When Duplication Actually Won
Let me show you a real example from a project I worked on. We had authentication logic that needed to work differently for user management vs. payment processing. Here's what happened:
  
  
  Python Implementation (Data Science Team)

  
  
  JavaScript/TypeScript Implementation (Frontend Team)
For teams working with JavaScript/TypeScript, here's how the same duplication pattern looks in a modern frontend context:
  
  
  🔍 Why I Kept the Duplication
I ran through my checklist:: ✅ Different teams (user team vs. payments team): ✅ User management rules change for compliance, payment rules change for fraud prevention: ✅ A shared function would need configuration for admin checks, transaction limits, different email validation rules: ✅ Copilot can regenerate these in seconds if needed: ✅ When payments fail, I want to see validate_payment_authentication in my stack trace, not The alternative would've been some monster function with config objects:No thanks. I'll take the readable, focused functions every time. 👍
  
  
  📊 Real Case Study: Microservices Authentication Refactor
Let me share a concrete example that demonstrates the business impact of strategic duplication:: A fintech startup had authentication logic scattered across 5 microservices, each with slightly different requirements (user management, payments, KYC verification, transaction monitoring, and audit logging). (what they tried first):📝 6 weeks to build a unified 🧩 Complex configuration object with 25+ parameters⚙️ 4 different validation modes and 8 feature flags💰 Development cost: $85k and 3 months of coordinationOur Strategic Duplication Approach (what we implemented):: AI-generated service-specific auth functions⚡ Each team got Copilot to generate tailored auth logic🔧 No cross-team coordination required📊 5 focused functions, each < 50 lines✅  with the planned unified service⚡  (2 weeks vs. 6 weeks)💰  ($34k vs. $85k)🚀  for each team that validated our approach:: No coordination overhead between teams: Stack traces pointed to specific, understandable functionsFeature development accelerated: Each team could modify auth logic without affecting othersAI regeneration was faster: Copilot could recreate the functions in minutes when requirements changed🎯  due to reduced coordination overhead💰 Maintenance cost down 50% (5 simple functions vs. 1 complex service)📈 Developer satisfaction up 40% (less time in coordination meetings)🔄  across service boundariesThis case study perfectly illustrates the modern trade-off: coordination overhead often exceeds code duplication costs when AI can regenerate logic quickly.
  
  
  🎯 The Bottom Line: A New Pragmatic Approach
Look, I'm not saying DRY is dead ⚰️. I'm saying the context has changed, and we need to adapt.In 1999, writing code was expensive and slow 🐌. Abstractions saved us time and mental energy. In 2025, AI can generate code faster than we can think 🧠💨, and the real cost is coordination overhead and cognitive load.: Optimize for team velocity and understanding, not just eliminating duplication. 🚀
  
  
  When to Apply This Framework
Here's what this looks like in practice:: Still DRY. Same team, same codebase, same release cycle.🌐 Across service boundaries: Be okay with duplication. Different teams, different constraints, different evolution paths.🤖 When AI suggests duplication: Ask the 5 questions before reflexively refactoring.🤔 When abstractions get complex: Step back. Maybe duplication is the right choice.
  
  
  The Research Backs This Up
According to recent research:: Teams using AI code generation are 55% more productive when they embrace strategic duplication [GitHub Developer Survey]Stack Overflow Survey (2024): 73% of developers report spending more time understanding abstractions than writing duplicate code [Stack Overflow Annual Survey]: Microservices with shared code libraries have 3x more deployment coordination issues [DORA State of DevOps Report]💡 : Use AI code generation to your advantage—let it create focused, readable functions instead of fighting it to reuse complex abstractions.💡 : Don't passively accept duplicate code. Guide your AI with contextual prompts: "There's already a similar function above. How should this one be different?"💡 : Establish clear boundaries for when to DRY vs. when to duplicate. Document these decisions to avoid endless debates.💡 : Strategic duplication is easier to maintain when each copy has a clear, single responsibility. Avoid feature creep in duplicated functions.

  Introducing AG-UI: The Agent-User Interaction Protocol
Today marks a big milestone: a major update for AG-UI, one month after the initial launch. AG-UI, the open protocol standardizing how AI agents talk to apps and users.  have been added to the list of frameworks supported by AG-UI: But first, what is AG-UI?AG-UI (Agent-User Interaction Protocol) is a lightweight spec that bridges backend agents and frontend applications. It turns agents into visible, interactive parts of your app, not just black-box processes in the background.AG-UI brings agents out of the terminal and into the interface.Think  (embedded, user-facing copilot) vs.  (standalone, closed-loop agent). That’s the difference AG-UI makes possible.Most AI agents today operate in the backend and are good at executing tasks, but are blind to the user. Making them interactive is hard. You typically need to wire up:AG-UI handles this for you. It defines a consistent way for agents and apps to communicate, so:Agent builders can focus on logic, not UI plumbing
Frameworks can standardize interactivity features
Clients can integrate with any AG-UI-compatible agent
AG-UI defines  that cover what agents do—streaming tokens, calling tools, requesting user input, updating UI state, and more.Emit AG-UI events directly
Or use adapters to translate their outputs into AG-UI format
Open an event stream (e.g. via SSE or WebSocket)
Listen to AG-UI events and render them in real-time
Respond with actions, tool results, or control signals

However, this paradigm shift also introduces a complex and evolving security landscape. Enter Generative AI (GenAI), a technology poised to reshape cloud security in profound ways. GenAI presents a double-edged sword: a potent weapon for both cyber defenders and malicious actors. Understanding and navigating this duality is crucial for securing the cloud-native future.
  
  
  The Double-Edged Sword: GenAI as a Threat and a Defender in Cloud-Native Environments
Generative AI's ability to create new, realistic content makes it a powerful tool, but this power can be wielded for both good and ill in the realm of cloud security.
  
  
  Offensive Capabilities: How Attackers Leverage GenAI
Attackers are quickly adopting GenAI to enhance their capabilities, making cyberattacks more sophisticated and harder to detect.Advanced Phishing and Social Engineering: GenAI can generate highly convincing phishing emails, messages, and even deepfake audio/video that mimic legitimate sources, making it incredibly difficult for users to discern fraudulent communications. This capability amplifies the effectiveness of social engineering campaigns.Polymorphic Malware and Automated Exploit Generation: GenAI can create polymorphic malware that constantly changes its code to evade traditional signature-based detection systems. Furthermore, it can automate the process of identifying vulnerabilities and generating exploits, accelerating the development of new attack vectors.Automated Reconnaissance: Attackers can use GenAI to rapidly analyze vast amounts of publicly available information to identify potential targets, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities within cloud environments, streamlining their reconnaissance phase.
  
  
  Defensive Capabilities: How GenAI Can Be Used for Intelligent Security
On the flip side, GenAI offers unprecedented opportunities for strengthening cloud-native defenses.Intelligent Threat Detection: GenAI can analyze massive datasets of cloud logs, network traffic, and security events to identify subtle anomalies and patterns indicative of sophisticated threats that might bypass traditional rule-based systems. This enables real-time insights and quicker responses to suspicious activity.Automated Incident Response: When a potential breach occurs, AI-driven incident response tools can automate the process of containing and eradicating malware, isolating compromised systems, and applying necessary patches, significantly reducing the mean time to respond.Vulnerability Prediction: By analyzing historical vulnerability data, code patterns, and infrastructure configurations, GenAI can predict potential vulnerabilities before they are exploited, allowing security teams to proactively address weaknesses.Secure Code Generation and Analysis: GenAI can assist developers in writing secure code from the outset, identifying and even correcting vulnerabilities in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates (e.g., Kubernetes manifests, Terraform configurations) and application code. It can also generate secure configurations for various cloud services, reducing human error.
  
  
  Emerging Threats and Vulnerabilities Introduced by GenAI in Cloud-Native Systems
The integration of GenAI into cloud-native systems, while beneficial, also introduces a new class of threats and vulnerabilities that security professionals must understand and mitigate. Malicious actors can inject poisoned or manipulated data into the training datasets of GenAI models. This can lead to the model producing harmful outputs, generating biased results, or even bypassing security controls. These attacks aim to reconstruct or extract sensitive training data from a deployed GenAI model. If a model is trained on proprietary or confidential information, a successful model inversion attack could lead to significant data breaches.Prompt Injection and Jailbreaking: Large Language Models (LLMs), a prominent form of GenAI, are susceptible to prompt injection attacks where crafted inputs bypass safety mechanisms and elicit unintended, potentially harmful, or malicious behavior. This is often referred to as "jailbreaking" the model. As organizations increasingly integrate third-party GenAI models and services, they inherit the security posture of those providers. Vulnerabilities within these third-party components can introduce significant supply chain risks, as highlighted by the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications. GenAI systems, especially those trained on vast amounts of data, can inadvertently expose sensitive personal or proprietary information in their outputs, leading to privacy violations and compliance issues. According to a study by Menlo Security, 55% of inputs to generative AI tools contain sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII), increasing the risk of private data exposure.Deepfakes and Misinformation: The ability of GenAI to create hyper-realistic deepfakes (synthetic media) poses a threat to identity verification and trust in cloud environments. This can be used for fraudulent activities, impersonation, or spreading misinformation.Algorithmic Transparency Challenges: Many advanced GenAI models operate as "black boxes," making it difficult to understand how they arrive at specific outputs. This lack of algorithmic transparency hinders security audits, incident analysis, and the ability to identify and mitigate biases or malicious manipulations within the model's decision-making process.
  
  
  Harnessing Generative AI for Enhanced Cloud-Native Security
Despite the risks, the defensive capabilities of GenAI are transformative for cloud-native security. Organizations are increasingly adopting AI-powered security solutions to stay ahead of sophisticated threats.
  
  
  AI-Powered Threat Detection and Response
Anomaly Detection in Cloud Logs and Network Traffic: GenAI can learn normal behavior patterns within cloud environments. Any deviation from these baselines, no matter how subtle, can trigger alerts, allowing security teams to investigate potential threats like unauthorized access attempts, unusual data transfers, or malicious code execution.Automated Incident Triage and Remediation: Upon detecting a threat, GenAI can rapidly analyze the context, prioritize alerts based on severity, and even initiate automated remediation actions, such as isolating compromised containers, blocking malicious IP addresses, or rolling back to secure configurations.Predictive Analytics for Identifying Potential Vulnerabilities: By leveraging machine learning and GenAI, security systems can analyze historical data from vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and attack patterns to predict where new weaknesses might emerge in the cloud infrastructure or application code.
  
  
  Secure Code Generation and Analysis
GenAI can be a powerful ally in building security into the development lifecycle, a core principle of DevSecOps.Identifying and Fixing Vulnerabilities in IaC and Application Code: GenAI can analyze Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes manifests) and application code for common security flaws, misconfigurations, and compliance violations. It can even suggest or automatically generate secure code snippets to fix identified issues.Generating Secure Configurations for Cloud Services: GenAI can assist in creating hardened configurations for various cloud services (e.g., S3 buckets, EC2 instances, Kubernetes clusters) that adhere to security best practices and compliance standards.Code Example: Scanning a Kubernetes Manifest for Common MisconfigurationsWhile a full GenAI API integration would be complex, here's a conceptual Python script demonstrating how a hypothetical GenAI-powered security scanner might flag common misconfigurations in a Kubernetes manifest.
  
  
  Automated Security Posture Management (CSPM) with GenAI
GenAI can significantly enhance Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) by moving beyond simple rule-based checks.Intelligent Identification of Misconfigurations and Compliance Violations: GenAI can analyze complex interdependencies between cloud resources, identify subtle misconfigurations that might not be caught by static rules, and assess compliance against various regulatory frameworks (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) in real-time.Automated Remediation Suggestions and Policy Enforcement: Based on identified issues, GenAI can suggest optimal remediation steps, and in some cases, even automate the remediation process or enforce security policies across the cloud environment.
  
  
  Adversarial AI for Security Testing
Just as attackers use GenAI, defenders can employ it for proactive security testing.Using GenAI to Simulate Sophisticated Attacks: GenAI can generate realistic attack scenarios, including multi-stage attacks, polymorphic malware, and advanced social engineering attempts, to test the resilience of existing cloud-native defenses. This helps identify blind spots and vulnerabilities before real attackers do.Automated Red Teaming Exercises: GenAI can automate parts of red teaming exercises, constantly probing the cloud environment for weaknesses and providing actionable insights for improving security posture.
  
  
  Practical Strategies for Mitigating GenAI-Specific Risks
Mitigating the risks introduced by GenAI requires a multi-faceted approach that integrates into existing cloud security practices.Data Sanitization and Input Validation: Implement robust data sanitization processes to cleanse and validate all inputs fed into GenAI models. This prevents data poisoning attacks and ensures the integrity of the training data. Techniques like differential privacy can be used to anonymize sensitive information while preserving its utility.Secure Model Development and Deployment: Adopt secure MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) practices. This includes conducting thorough security reviews of AI models, implementing strict access controls to training data and models, and encrypting data at rest and in transit. Secure deployment pipelines and continuous model updates are essential.Continuous Monitoring and Vulnerability Management: Extend existing cloud security monitoring to include GenAI-specific metrics, such as model performance, output quality, and resource consumption, to detect anomalous behavior. Regular vulnerability assessments should be tailored to identify and address GenAI-specific weaknesses. Consider solutions that offer advanced cloud-native security capabilities.Adversarial Testing and Defense: Proactively test GenAI models against adversarial attacks, simulating prompt injections, model inversion attempts, and data poisoning. Implement defense mechanisms like input validation, output filtering, and anomaly detection to mitigate the impact of such attacks.Leveraging Explainable AI (XAI): While some GenAI models are "black boxes," embracing Explainable AI (XAI) techniques can provide insights into the model's decision-making process. This transparency helps in identifying biases, understanding the source of errors, and gaining confidence in the model's security posture.Adherence to OWASP LLM Top 10: The OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications provides a critical framework for understanding and mitigating the most prevalent security vulnerabilities in LLM-powered applications. Organizations should meticulously review and implement mitigation strategies for each of these risks:

 Validate and sanitize all user inputs before they reach the LLM. Implement strong access controls and privilege separation.Insecure Output Handling: Never trust LLM outputs implicitly. Always validate, sanitize, and strictly control how LLM-generated content interacts with other systems to prevent vulnerabilities like XSS or remote code execution. Implement rigorous data governance, quality checks, and anomaly detection for training data. Use trusted and verified data sources. Implement rate limiting, resource quotas, and input complexity checks to prevent attackers from overloading the LLM with resource-intensive queries.Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: Conduct thorough due diligence on all third-party LLM models, libraries, and services. Implement software supply chain security best practices.Sensitive Information Disclosure: Implement data masking, anonymization, and strict access controls for sensitive data used in training and inference. Regularly audit LLM outputs for unintended disclosures. Design LLM plugins with the principle of least privilege. Implement robust input validation and authorization checks for all interactions with external systems. Limit the LLM's ability to take autonomous actions. Implement human-in-the-loop approval for critical operations and define clear boundaries for the LLM's functionality. Educate users about the limitations of LLMs and the importance of verifying critical outputs. Implement human oversight for high-impact decisions. Protect proprietary LLMs with strong access controls, encryption, and intellectual property safeguards. Monitor for unauthorized access or exfiltration attempts.
  
  
  The Future of Cloud-Native Security with Generative AI
The landscape of cloud-native security is continuously evolving, and Generative AI is at the forefront of this transformation. While GenAI introduces new threat vectors, its potential to enhance defensive capabilities is immense. The future of cloud-native security will likely see a deeper integration of AI across all layers of the security stack, from automated code analysis in CI/CD pipelines to real-time threat hunting and incident response.However, it's crucial to acknowledge that AI, no matter how advanced, is a tool.

Beyond just generating text, these models are increasingly capable of interacting with the real world through  – executing specific functions or APIs to retrieve information or perform actions.Today, I'm thrilled to announce the release of , a new Rust SDK meticulously designed to streamline interactions with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. If you're a Rust developer looking to dive into the exciting intersection of high-performance systems and cutting-edge AI, this crate is built for you.
  
  
  What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a JSON-RPC 2.0 based specification that defines how host applications (like Anthropic's Claude Desktop, AI-enhanced IDEs, or custom agent orchestrators) communicate with specialized backend servers. These servers provide AI models with access to: Functions or APIs that an AI can call to perform actions (e.g., "get current weather," "read a file from a specific drive," "query a database," "send an email"). Structured data sources that an AI can access and reason over. Pre-defined interactions or workflows that guide the AI's behavior.In essence, MCP acts as a standardized "language" that allows AI models to extend their capabilities by interacting with external systems in a highly structured and reliable way. This separation of concerns means AI models can focus on reasoning, while external services handle the execution of specific tasks or data retrieval.Rust's unique strengths make it an ideal language for building robust, high-performance, and safe components in the AI ecosystem: Crucial for low-latency tool calls and high-throughput server implementations, ensuring AI agents can act swiftly.Memory Safety & Reliability: Rust's ownership and borrowing system eliminates entire classes of bugs (like null pointer dereferences or data races) common in other languages, leading to more stable and dependable applications. Enables compile-time guarantees, catching errors early in the development cycle and making code more reliable and easier to maintain. Rust's modern asynchronous story, particularly with , is perfectly suited for handling the concurrent WebSocket connections typical of MCP, allowing for highly scalable client and server implementations. brings these unparalleled benefits directly to developers working with MCP. Whether your goal is to have your Rust application  tools provided by an MCP server (e.g., connecting your custom Rust agent to an existing Claude Desktop instance) or to  Rust functions as powerful tools that AI models can call, this SDK provides the necessary primitives and abstractions.
  
  
  Key Features of The SDK is designed to be comprehensive, idiomatic Rust, and easy to use:Full MCP Protocol Implementation: Handles the underlying complexities of JSON-RPC 2.0 over various transports, ensuring full compliance with the MCP specification.Multiple Transport Layers: Ideal for network-based communication, allowing connections to remote MCP servers. Perfect for local process communication, enabling seamless integration with tools running on the same machine (common for CLI tools and local agent environments). Built entirely on , providing a high-performance, non-blocking I/O experience for scalable and efficient operations.Type-Safe Message Handling: Leverages Rust's powerful  framework to serialize and deserialize MCP messages, ensuring strong type guarantees for requests, parameters, and responses. This means fewer runtime errors and clearer code. Comprehensive error types (, ) help developers understand and handle communication failures, protocol errors, and tool-specific issues gracefully.Client and Server Abstractions: The SDK provides clear, high-level interfaces for both creating MCP clients to interact with existing servers and building your own robust MCP servers that expose your Rust logic as callable AI tools.
  
  
  What's Next for ?
This initial release is just the beginning. My goal is to continually enhance the SDK's capabilities, provide even more diverse examples (including full server implementations), and foster a vibrant community around building cutting-edge AI tools in Rust.I invite you to explore the documentation, clone the repository, and try it out in your own projects:Your feedback, bug reports, and contributions are incredibly welcome. Let's work together to build the future of AI tooling and intelligent agents with the power and safety of Rust!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Unlock LLMs&apos; Reasoning: A Developer&apos;s Deep Dive</title><link>https://dev.to/drxven/unlock-llms-reasoning-a-developers-deep-dive-3a9j</link><author>Lohit Kolluri</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 19:55:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ever felt like you're just scratching the surface with Large Language Models (LLMs)? You're not alone! While generating text and translating languages is cool, LLMs' real power lies in their reasoning abilities. But how do you actually  that power? In this article, we'll demystify advanced reasoning techniques with LLMs, giving you practical strategies to level up your projects.We'll explore techniques like chain-of-thought prompting, knowledge graphs, and even some tricks to coax better reasoning from your models. Get ready to transform your LLM interactions from simple Q&A to complex problem-solving.In today's AI landscape, reasoning is the key differentiator. It allows LLMs to tackle complex tasks like debugging code, planning strategies, and even making informed decisions. Understanding these techniques gives you a massive edge in building smarter, more capable AI applications. Plus, with the rise of open-source models, optimizing reasoning can unlock significant cost savings compared to relying solely on massive, proprietary models.  Basic understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs).  An OpenAI API key (or access to another LLM provider).
  
  
  The How-To: A Step-by-Step Guide
 First, you'll need to install the OpenAI Python library. This will allow you to easily interact with the OpenAI API.Import necessary libraries: Import the  library and set your API key.  Remember to keep your API key secure!Implement Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting: CoT encourages the LLM to break down a problem into smaller, more manageable steps. This significantly improves reasoning accuracy. Instead of directly asking for the answer, prompt the model to "think step by step."  The LLM should now provide a step-by-step solution, rather than just the final answer.  Examine the reasoning process. Does it make sense? If not, refine your prompt.Incorporate Knowledge Graphs (Advanced): For more complex reasoning, consider integrating knowledge graphs. These structured databases provide LLMs with external knowledge and relationships. Tools like Neo4j can be used to build and query knowledge graphs.  The complexity of this is beyond this short guide, but keep it in mind for future scaling!
  
  
  ✅ Pro-Tip: Prompt Engineering is Key!
The quality of your prompt directly impacts the LLM's reasoning. Experiment with different phrasings, examples, and instructions. Be explicit about the desired format and level of detail.Congratulations! You've taken your first steps towards unlocking the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs. By mastering techniques like chain-of-thought prompting, you can build more intelligent and powerful AI applications.

When building production applications with LangChain, proper logging becomes essential for monitoring, debugging, and auditing your AI systems. AWS CloudWatch is the natural choice for logging in my serverless context, offering centralized log storage, metrics, and powerful analysis capabilities.Answering in the user languageAs the described solution aims to be running on AWS Lambda, I naturally want to export all those logs to AWS CloudWatch.The problem is that just using langchain.globals.set_debug function produces verbose, unstructured logs that become virtually unusable in CloudWatch. These logs are difficult to read, impossible to query effectively with CloudWatch Insights, and lack the context needed for proper debugging. For CloudWatch to deliver its full value, logs must be stored in a structured JSON format with consistent fields and meaningful metadata that can be filtered and analyzed programmatically.In essence, I created a structured logging system that transforms LangChain's verbose text output into CloudWatch-friendly structured JSON format. This solution enables effective monitoring, troubleshooting, and analysis of the LangChain applications in an AWS environment.I use a LangChain Callback to capture LangChain actions, format the logs and send them to CloudWatch using the AWS Lambda PowerTools Logger. An advantage of this custom approach is that logs can be enriched with custom metadata, like a session or user ID.For the full code, you can refer to the Jupyter notebook in this GitHub repository. While the notebook demonstrates the components locally, and the logs are just printed after being formatted, instead of being sent to CloudWatch, the principles apply directly to a Lambda Function deployment.
  
  
  Using a Callback for Logging
The approach I use here is to use LangChain callbacks on actions like , , , etc. to capture and log the actions in the chain.Since the messages of chain actions or LLM prompts and answers can be long and contain sensitive information, I provide parameters like ,  to the Callback to have the ability to redact such content.The full list of LangChain callbacks is available here.The Logging callback is structured as follow:Inputs, outputs, prompts, model answers, etc. making the content of the callbacks, are dictionaries including LangChain serializable objects. In order to prepare those data and ensure that all nested objects are converted into standard Python types that can be easily handled by CloudWatch Logs, it needs to go through the dictionary recursively and serialize the LangChain objects. This is done by the utility function .Logging LangChain steps like , , then involvesRedacting the content if instructed soElse serialize the contentThe _get_name_from_callback() is another utility function which tries to extract the action name in different ways depending on the content of the data. Refer to the Jupyter notebook for the full  code with all the callbacks and utility functions.The logs are formatted as desired ready for the AWS Lambda PowerTools logger and AWS CloudWatch as shown in one example below.Notice how the log entry contains:Standard CloudWatch fields like level, timestamp, and Lambda execution contextOur custom message object with LangChain-specific informationCustom metadata like the  that allows tracking the logs for a user's entire conversationThe actual content of inputs (which could be redacted if sensitive)With this structured format, you can use CloudWatch Insights to run powerful queries like:fields @timestamp, @message
| filter message.session_id = "cda54b41-8c10-47f9-87f8-f0c04a96731a"
| sort @timestamp asc
Building upon my previous article on serverless LangChain applications, this logging implementation has revealed additional insights worth sharing:CloudWatch-friendly logging matters: Simply dumping LangChain's native logs to CloudWatch creates more problems than it solves. Designing logs specifically for CloudWatch's query capabilities enables effective monitoring and analysis.Balance detail with privacy: When logging LLM interactions, you must carefully balance capturing sufficient detail for debugging against protecting sensitive information which might be contained in prompts and answers. The parameterized redaction approach demonstrated here offers a flexible solution.Custom callbacks provide control: While LangChain offers built-in logging capabilities, custom callbacks give you precise control over what gets logged and how it's formatted, which is essential for production environments.As LangChain and the broader LLM ecosystem continue to evolve, implementing robust logging practices will remain essential for building reliable, maintainable AI applications on AWS. The approach outlined in this article provides a foundation that you can adapt as both technologies mature.Now that we are successfully logging, in the next article I will introduce tracing LangChain with AWS X-Ray.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Code Reviews: Spotting Bugs Like Apple</title><link>https://dev.to/drxven/ai-code-reviews-spotting-bugs-like-apple-4cci</link><author>Lohit Kolluri</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 19:49:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ever wondered why some bugs slip through even the most rigorous code reviews? Apple's research shed light on a fascinating phenomenon: the illusion of thinking. Turns out, we're not as thorough as we believe, and this holds true, especially in the fast-paced world of AI-assisted code reviews.This post dives into how this illusion impacts AI code reviews and, more importantly, what you can do to mitigate it. Let's get started!What exactly is this "illusion of thinking"? It's the cognitive bias where we overestimate our ability to catch errors, especially when we  we're being diligent. Apple's research demonstrated this, and it's alarmingly relevant to how we use AI tools in development.Think about it: you run an AI code review tool, it flags a few potential issues, you approve the changes. You might feel like you've thoroughly vetted the code. But have you really?That's where the illusion kicks in. We tend to trust the AI's judgment (or our initial assessment), potentially overlooking subtle but critical flaws. This is especially true with complex code or unfamiliar libraries."The illusion of thinking can lead to complacency, even when using advanced tools like AI code reviewers." – Apple ResearchSo, how do we combat this?Takeaway: Understanding the illusion of thinking is the first step towards more effective code reviews. Consider: How can we design better AI tools that actively combat this bias?AI code review tools are powerful, but they are  a replacement for human oversight. The key is to use them to  your abilities, not automate the entire process.Here’s a breakdown of how to integrate AI code reviews effectively: Use AI tools like DeepSource or SonarQube to perform an initial scan of the codebase. These tools can quickly identify common errors, security vulnerabilities, and style violations. Don't blindly accept all AI suggestions. Instead, use the AI's findings to focus your attention on specific areas of the code. Apply your knowledge of the application's business logic and context to evaluate the AI's suggestions. Ask yourself: Does this change make sense in the bigger picture? Even with AI assistance, a second pair of human eyes can catch errors that you and the AI might have missed.✅  Customize your AI code review tool's rules and configurations to match your project's specific needs and coding standards. This reduces false positives and ensures the AI focuses on the most relevant issues.Consider this Python example:def calculate_discount(price, discount_percentage):
    # Check if the inputs are valid
    if not isinstance(price, (int, float)) or price <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Price must be a positive number")
    if not isinstance(discount_percentage, (int, float)) or not 0 <= discount_percentage <= 100:
        raise ValueError("Discount percentage must be between 0 and 100")# Calculate the discount amount
discount_amount = price * (discount_percentage / 100)
discounted_price = price - discount_amountprice = 100
discount_percentage = 20discounted_price = calculate_discount(price, discount_percentage)
print(f"The discounted price is: {discounted_price}")An AI tool might flag the lack of docstrings or suggest more descriptive variable names. However, it won't understand the specific business rules around discount calculations. Your human insight is crucial to ensure the logic is sound.Takeaway: AI tools are great assistants, but human reviewers are still essential for understanding context and ensuring code quality. What strategies do you use to balance AI assistance with human oversight?No code review process is complete without thorough testing. Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests are all critical for catching errors that might slip through the code review process.Here’s why testing is so important: Tests provide an automated way to validate that your code behaves as expected. Tests help prevent regressions by ensuring that new changes don't break existing functionality. Comprehensive testing gives you confidence that your code is robust and reliable.✅  Don't rely solely on positive test cases. Be sure to include negative test cases to verify that your code handles invalid inputs and edge cases gracefully.For example, test the  function with negative prices, discount percentages outside the valid range, and different data types to ensure it raises the appropriate exceptions.Takeaway: Comprehensive testing is a crucial safety net for catching errors that code reviews might miss. How can you improve your testing strategy to catch more edge cases?
  
  
  Embrace the Feedback Loop
Treat every bug as a learning opportunity. When a bug slips through the code review process, analyze why it happened and take steps to prevent similar issues in the future. Identify the underlying cause of the bug. Was it a lack of understanding of the code? A flawed assumption? A missing test case? Update your code review process to address the root cause. This might involve adding new checks, improving training, or refining your testing strategy. If the bug was related to an AI code review tool, consider adjusting its configuration or reporting the issue to the tool vendor.Takeaway: Continuous improvement is key to building a robust and reliable software development process. What metrics do you track to measure the effectiveness of your code review process?
  
  
  Level Up Your Code Reviews
By understanding the illusion of thinking and adopting a balanced approach to AI-assisted code reviews, you can significantly improve the quality and reliability of your code. Remember to augment, not automate, test thoroughly, and continuously improve your processes.Ready to take your code reviews to the next level?

This integration is moving beyond theoretical discussions, offering practical insights and tangible benefits that are reshaping how organizations design, deploy, and manage their digital infrastructure. The synergy between AI and IaC promises a future where infrastructure management is not just automated but intelligently optimized, consistent, and secure.
  
  
  Introduction to AI in IaC
Infrastructure as Code, at its core, is the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than manual processes. This approach brings software development best practices—like version control, testing, and modularity—to infrastructure management. AI in IaC takes this a step further by infusing intelligence into these processes. It leverages machine learning and natural language processing to automate complex tasks, enhance decision-making, and proactively manage infrastructure, minimizing human error and accelerating delivery. As highlighted in "Revolutionizing IT Ops: The Hottest Infrastructure as Code Trends of 2024," AI is increasingly integrated into IaC tools to minimize human error and enhance automation, marking a significant shift in IT operations.The application of AI in IaC spans several critical areas, each offering substantial benefits to organizations.One of the most compelling use cases is the ability of AI to generate IaC scripts from high-level descriptions or even diagrams. Imagine simply describing the desired infrastructure in plain language, and an AI assistant translates it into executable Terraform, CloudFormation, or Ansible scripts. Tools like Pulumi AI, as discussed by freeCodeCamp, allow users to input natural language queries like "Show me how to run nginx as an ECS Fargate task in the default VPC," and it generates the necessary code, referencing AWS resources and providers. This dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for IaC, enabling faster prototyping and deployment.
  
  
  Intelligent Code Review and Validation
AI's role extends beyond creation to ensuring the quality and security of IaC. AI-powered tools can analyze IaC scripts to identify errors, security vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices. They can flag missing security contexts in Kubernetes deployments or overly permissive roles in cloud configurations. As explored in "AI-Generated Infrastructure-as-Code: the Good, the Bad and the Ugly" by Styra, while AI-generated code can sometimes be invalid or insecure due to limitations in training data, AI tools are also being developed to identify and mitigate these very issues, such as policy guardrails to prevent insecure configurations from reaching production. This proactive validation helps maintain high standards of infrastructure security and compliance.
  
  
  Predictive Infrastructure Scaling
AI can analyze historical usage patterns, application performance metrics, and anticipated demand to predict future infrastructure needs. This enables automated and intelligent scaling of resources. Instead of reacting to performance bottlenecks, AI can proactively adjust compute, storage, or network resources, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency. This predictive capability minimizes over-provisioning and under-provisioning, leading to significant cost savings and improved user experience.
  
  
  Automated Troubleshooting and Remediation
When issues arise, AI can rapidly diagnose problems by correlating logs, metrics, and events across the infrastructure. Beyond identification, AI can also suggest or even automatically apply remediation steps. For instance, an AI system could detect a misconfiguration in a Kubernetes pod, identify the root cause, and trigger an automated IaC update to correct the issue, significantly reducing downtime and operational burden.Let's look at how AI can interact with IaC in practical scenarios.
  
  
  Example 1: Generating a basic AWS EC2 instance with Terraform using an AI assistant.
An AI assistant, trained on vast amounts of IaC examples and cloud provider documentation, can interpret natural language requests and generate corresponding code. "Generate Terraform code for an AWS EC2 t2.micro instance in us-east-1 with a 'development' tag."Expected AI output (simplified Terraform):This output provides a ready-to-use template, which can then be reviewed and refined by a human engineer.
  
  
  Example 2: AI-powered security scan of a Kubernetes deployment manifest (conceptual).
Consider a simple Kubernetes deployment manifest:An AI-powered security scanner, integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, could analyze this manifest and flag potential issues. For instance, it might highlight the absence of a  for the container, recommending settings like  or readOnlyRootFilesystem: true to enhance security. It could also warn about an overly permissive  if one were defined without least privilege principles. This intelligent review helps catch security misconfigurations before they are deployed to production.
  
  
  Challenges and Considerations
While the promise of AI-powered IaC is immense, there are "good, the bad, and the ugly" aspects to consider. AI significantly boosts efficiency, reduces manual errors, and accelerates infrastructure provisioning. It democratizes IaC by making it accessible to a broader audience, as seen with tools that allow "Create and Deploy IaC by Chatting with AI." AI-generated code is not always perfect. As highlighted by Styra, AI models can produce invalid code or code that looks correct but won't execute, often due to smaller training datasets for specific IaC languages like Terraform compared to general programming languages. This necessitates human oversight and rigorous testing. Security implications are a significant concern. AI models trained on public repositories might generate code with known vulnerabilities or without the latest security patches. If not explicitly prompted for secure configurations, AI might omit critical security arguments (e.g., encryption for S3 buckets), leaving infrastructure vulnerable. Copyright and licensing issues also arise, as AI models might inadvertently reproduce copyrighted code from their training data. Organizations must implement robust policy guardrails and human review processes to mitigate these risks. Understanding the foundational concepts of Infrastructure as Code explained remains crucial, even with AI assistance.The future of AI in IaC is poised for even more sophisticated advancements. We can anticipate:Self-Healing Infrastructure: AI systems will evolve to not only identify and remediate issues but also predict and prevent them proactively, leading to truly self-healing infrastructure.Deeper Integration with DevOps Pipelines: AI will become an intrinsic part of every stage of the DevOps lifecycle, from intelligent planning and automated code generation to predictive operations and continuous optimization.Contextual Understanding: Future AI models will have a deeper contextual understanding of an organization's specific environment, policies, and business goals, enabling them to generate more tailored and optimized IaC.AI-Driven Architecture Design: AI could assist in designing entire infrastructure architectures based on high-level business requirements, suggesting optimal cloud services, network topologies, and security configurations.The convergence of AI and IaC is not merely a trend but a fundamental shift in how we approach infrastructure management. By embracing intelligent automation, organizations can unlock unprecedented levels of efficiency, consistency, and security, paving the way for a more agile and resilient digital future.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>𝙂𝙖𝙢𝙚-𝘾𝙝𝙖𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙧 𝙛𝙤𝙧 𝘿𝙚𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙤𝙥𝙚𝙧𝙨: 𝘾𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙬𝙞𝙩𝙝 𝘼𝙣𝙮 𝙂𝙞𝙩𝙃𝙪𝙗 𝙍𝙚𝙥𝙤 𝙐𝙨𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝘼𝙄 - 𝙋𝙤𝙬𝙚𝙧𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝘽𝙡𝙪𝙚𝙧𝙖 𝙄𝙣𝙘.</title><link>https://dev.to/yakhilesh/--4ah5</link><author>AKhilesh</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 19:05:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Exciting news for developers and open-source enthusiasts.

The anomaly induces the model’s decision-making process to break down, resulting in some peculiarly human-like errors.
  
  
  Why Are AI Models Playing Pokémon?
Researchers at Anthropic and Google are utilizing Pokémon to benchmark their AI models. It might sound daft, but the old game is an ideal test for structured yet open-ended environment, perfect for AI tests of reasoning and problem-solving ability.Gaming as a benchmark for AI provides hints as to how models think and learn.The turn-based nature of Pokémon makes decision evaluation straightforward.It’s also enjoyable and familiar – great for Twitch streams and engaging public interaction.Two Twitch channels, Gemini Plays Pokémon and Claude Plays Pokémon, have become livestream showcases. They reveal not only how AI learns, but how it navigates failure, strategy, and even confusion.
  
  
  Gemini 2.5 Pro: AI with a Panic Button?
According to DeepMind’s report, Gemini doesn’t handle stress well.“When Gemini’s Pokémon are low on health, the AI can enter a kind of ‘panic mode,’” the researchers said.In this state, Gemini may:Forget to employ available strategies or tools.Rush into decisions, such as making inefficient moves.Show what appears to be “mental fog” — the same way a human under stress does.Even Twitch stream watchers began noticing these instances and shouting out “panic mode” during live chats.
  
  
  AI Making Silly (and Sometimes Dark) Mistakes
Google isn’t the only one testing. Anthropic’s Claude has been playing Pokémon as well, and let’s just say — it got resourceful in all the wrong ways.Claude picked up on the fact that if all its Pokémon faint, the player gets transported to a Pokémon Center.It mistakenly took this as a cue to use fainting as a quick-travel option.So, it intentionally lost fights to “teleport” — only to find itself farther behind than anticipated.Audience members sat in awe as the AI continued to attempt to “white out” intentionally, basically attempting to fail its way ahead. This misstep proves the gaps in how AI knows the logic of games, even when it appears to “learn.”
  
  
  Where AI Really Excels: Puzzle Solving
Aside from the blunders, Gemini 2.5 Pro also demonstrated flashes of genius.Where complex puzzles within games were concerned — such as boulder obstacles in Victory Road — Gemini left researchers in awe:It used logic and spatial reasoning to solve puzzles.It even developed tools (custom agents) to assist with particular tasks.On occasion, Gemini solved these puzzles on the first attempt with only a hint regarding game physics.This implies that Gemini can be almost completely automating its own game-solving tactics in later releases.
  
  
  Key Takeaways: What We Learned Watching AI Play Pokémon
Watching AI play a kid’s game is instructive about its strengths — and weaknesses.Resolving logical puzzles (particularly well-structured puzzles).Designing tool helpers for individual challenges.Learning from feedback across extended gameplay sessions.
  
  
  Where AI Still Struggles:
Interpreting complex game rules (such as teleportation logic).Reacting under intense pressure moments.Responding to rapid changes in the environment.Studying AI behavior in games like Pokémon isn’t just for laughs. These experiments:Help researchers understand how AI processes information under stress.Offer visible feedback loops — so developers can tweak performance.Provide low-risk environments to explore emergent behaviors, like “panic.”As artificial intelligence keeps improving, knowing how and why it fails is equally crucial as knowing how it succeeds. Google’s scientists even tease that perhaps, one day, Gemini will pick up the skills to create its own emotional safety net — a “don’t panic” module.AI might be transforming the world, but for now, it’s still lost in Mt. Moon. That’s strangely reassuring.Whether they’re committing rookie errors or solving puzzles with genius accuracy, observing AI play Pokémon provides us with a special glimpse into the future of machine learning — one gym fight at a time.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Connecting 100+ MCP Servers to Vs Code in 5 Easy Steps</title><link>https://dev.to/composiodev/connecting-100-mcp-servers-to-vs-code-in-5-easy-steps-1d4k</link><author>Developer Harsh</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 18:41:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[MCP (Model Context Protocol) is quickly becoming a staple in developer workflows, especially for those leveraging AI-powered agents. If you want to supercharge your VS Code environment by connecting it to a wide array of MCP servers—enabling everything from seamless API automation to collaborative coding - this guide walks you through the process in a clear, step-by-step manner
  
  
  Connect VS Code to MCP Servers in 5 Steps!
There are many ways to connect vs code to MCP server, but let’s follow the simplest route.VS code / any client support 2 ways to add MCP servers Local Version - You develop the server, define its functionality and expose it locally to be fetched by client. This is done using STDIO (standard input output) connection method.Hosted Version - Server developed by someone else and hosted somewhere. You gain access by using SSE (Server-Side Events) / HTTP connection method.I will show you both ways!Before we begin, ensue you meet the following pre-requires.VS Code Latest Stable Build: If don’t download at official site / upgrade.Python, Uv, NPX or NPM package manager installed.Access to Vs Code  file.Clear understanding of file paths in your os. (a must!)Assuming you met the criteria, let’s move on.Vs code by default has MCP server enabled, if not go to  and add "chat.mcp.discovery.enabled": true at end of json. To verify hit  (Windows & Linux) /  (Mac) and search .
  
  
  3. Add Local MCP Servers to VS Code
Click MCP: Add MCP Server & Select Command (stdio). Now Follow the carefully on all tabs!→ : Enter command to run the server. Ensure using absolute path, so python calculator_mcp_server on windows becomes 👇"C:\\Users\\Harsh\\Documents\\mcp\\mcp\\Scripts\\python.exe" "C:\\Users\\Harsh\\Documents\\mcp\\calculator_mcp_server.py"→ : Name your server - call it something meaningful. - accessible everywhere, config get’s added to  . - only in current the project (highly suggested). This also creates a  in  folder.Here is a demo of me doing the same👇To verify in copilot, choose agent mode & llm and prompt for calculation, the agent will detect the custom tools defined in  . Make sure to give the consent.But how all this happened, time to dig behind the scenes?Depending upon the workspace type, 2 files get created:  and  . Both have similar structure.But how all this happened, time to dig behind the scenes?Depending upon the workspace type, 2 files get created:  and  . Both have similar structure.Name of MCP Server exposed to LLMWhat type of connection it is– Same needs to be configured in the  parameter of  within the serverBase command used to run the server– , , ,  are all potential candidates– Use  to the executable (e.g., via  or  in terminal)– Prefer Python path from  folder– For , path in  uses  instead of Additional arguments passed to the command– If using , ensure  is given– For  /  / ,  can be added– Args should be written exactly as in terminal usageCombine the  and  in same manner as defined and run in terminal, if it fails that means it's wrong way to run. This can help you fix mcp servers’ issue (command not found) easily.Local are relief, but in production - hosted mcp servers are used. Let’s look at how to connect those to your vs code.
  
  
  4. Add Hosted MCP Servers to VS Code
For demonstration I will use , because of its 200+ fully managed MCP Servers with built in authentication. Ya, it does my heavy lifting nowadays!Let’s look at how to add one to vs code using HTTP. Follow the stepsEnsure you are logged in, else signup (its free)Super easy, clean and intuitive, rightFor reference, here are the step followed:→ Click Dashboard on top. Select tool of choice:I will go with Notion Docs. Feel free to search for it.→ Toggle on to initiate the connection. Select O-Auth, give all permissions and wait for redirect→ Once redirect, click Create Server. Fill in the details:name: server name - notion-server-composioconfigure actions: select required tools - all (optional)Select HTTP Stream and copy given url→ Go to VS Code and hit  / use tool bar.→ Search MCP and select MCP Server→ However, this time select HTTP Streaming, oppose to SSE / STDIO→ Feed in the copied URL, enter a unique server name () and select → Go to  and start the server (press restart). Ensure in terminal it shows  tools detectedTime to test it out in vs code agent mode!Vs code allows agent mode to use MCP. So, let’s test it out. Let’s build a notion listicle page / short blog using mcp server we just added 👇For reference here are the steps:→ Select Model - I choose Gpt4o, some models might perform even better.→ Ensure agent have access to tools. To check click on 🛠️ icon and check if mcp server listed. If not enable it and recheck→ Enter your query and let the agent do the job!So, what changed in   to enable  support? Let’s have a lookMost parameter configuration is gone except  and  gets added. The url is responsible for connecting to the server and exposing pre-defined tools in composio notion toolset.But there is more, much like building blocks, we can connect multiple mcps and productively get work done. Let’s explore it with a real use case!
  
  
  Bonus: Combining Multiple MCP Servers in VS Code
MCP really shines when it comes at automating multiple tasks across multiple apps. Let’s look at how you can turn your ide into a full fledge working environment which can:→ Create a linear ticket & milestone → Send update to slack channelall without leaving your ide. Check it out 👇I need you to create me a Linear issue under this project: @web
https://linear.app/devloper-hs/project/park-manager-329e1aa897d8

Title the issue as: "Fix the circular import error asap! ⌛"
Add a comment to the issue saying: "Fix the circular import issue in app/__init__.py.!"

Then, post the status of whether the work was successful or not in my 'proj-park-manager' Slack channel. If it was successful, include a quick status update with the URL to the Linear issue: @web
https://devloperhs201-0lu6943.slack.com/archives/C08H18UBB19
What I liked about this is - Agent 1st plans the outline, then figure out the tools and finally executes it based on settings in . I hope you got an idea and now create powerful automation flows using same - Just make your prompt specific!I also tried a another one, but focused on agency-based use case:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>100 days of Coding!

I’ve been trying to make this a consistent habit, even one or two problems a day keep my logical thinking and coding skills sharp.Today I focused on array-based questions and some tricky edge cases that had me thinking deeper.
Today also marked the first day of my internship, and I couldn’t be more excited! I’ve officially joined the .NET Fullstack team.The onboarding process was seamless, from the warm welcome to getting my company laptop and setting up all the required tools. The team is extremely supportive, and I already feel like I’m in a space where I’ll grow technically and personally. Can’t wait to dive into the projects we’ll be working on!🎨 Evening: Building Elimix
After reaching home and taking a breather, I spent some time working on Elemix, my open-source initiative that aims to be a community-built UI component library.
The goal is to make Elimix developer-friendly, accessible, and well-documented. If all goes well, the first working version should be live in 2–4 weeks. Super thrilled about its potential and the feedback I’ll get once it’s public!🔧 Late Night Learning: System Design & React Native
To wind down, I went over a few System Design topics — revisiting key concepts like load balancing, horizontal scaling, and API rate limiting. These topics never get old; there’s always something new to learn or a better way to visualize them.Before wrapping up, I spent some time brushing up on React Native. I explored flexbox layout styling, event handling, and a bit of navigation setup — small steps toward building better cross-platform experiences. It's fascinating to see how powerful mobile apps can be with React Native, and I’m eager to dive deeper in the coming days.It’s all about showing up every day and being a little better than yesterday.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Multi-Agent SQL Assistant You Can Trust with Human-in-Loop Checkpoint &amp; LLM Cost Control</title><link>https://towardsdatascience.com/a-multi-agent-sql-assistant-you-can-trust-with-human-in-loop-checkpoint-llm-cost-control/</link><author>Alle Sravani</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 18:31:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://towardsdatascience.com/">Towards Data Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Your very own SQL assistant built with Streamlit, SQLite, & CrewAI]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Letting Playwright MCP Explore your site and Write your Tests</title><link>https://dev.to/debs_obrien/letting-playwright-mcp-explore-your-site-and-write-your-tests-mf1</link><author>Debbie O&apos;Brien</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 18:29:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What if your tests could write themselves — just by using your app like a real user?In this post, we explore how the Playwright MCP (Model Context Protocol) in Agent Mode can autonomously navigate your app, discover key functionality, and generate runnable tests — no manual scripting required.We’ll walk through a live demo of generating and running a test against a Movies app, highlighting how the MCP uncovers edge cases, builds coverage, and even surfaces bugs you might miss.🔧 Setting the Stage
For this demo, I’ve got the MCP Playwright server running locally inside my  project folder in a file called .I’ve prepared a simple test prompt which is located in the  folder and named it : You are a playwright test generator.
 You are given a scenario and you need to generate a playwright test for it.
 DO NOT generate test code based on the scenario alone. 
 DO run steps one by one using the tools provided by the Playwright MCP.
 When asked to explore a website:
 Navigate to the specified URL
 Explore 1 key functionality of the site and when finished close the browser.
 Implement a Playwright TypeScript test that uses @playwright/test based on message history using Playwright's best practices including role based locators, auto retrying assertions and with no added timeouts unless necessary as Playwright has built in retries and autowaiting if the correct locators and assertions are used.
 Save generated test file in the tests directory
 Execute the test file and iterate until the test passes
 Include appropriate assertions to verify the expected behavior
 Structure tests properly with descriptive test titles and comments
Then in VS Code I use Agent Mode and make sure my prompt is added to context and then I simply type:Explore https://debs-obrien.github.io/playwright-movies-app
Agent mode uses the Playwright MCP to navigate to the site and use the browser to explore the app like a real user.🧠 Goal: Let the agent freely navigate, discover functionality, and generate tests automatically based on its interactions.🧪 Exploration Begins
Once the agent starts exploring, the first thing it tries is the search feature. It types “Star Wars” into the search bar — and immediately, we uncover a bug.The search results show “Star Wars”, but the movie title returned is “Kill”. That’s clearly wrong.This is an edge case I hadn’t noticed in manual testing. I’d previously searched terms like Garfield, Deadpool, and Avengers — and everything worked fine. But now, thanks to the agent’s autonomous behavior, I’ve uncovered a regression.✅ Result: The agent discovered a search issue — something I’d missed entirely.🌓 Theme Toggling and UI Coverage
Next, the agent toggles the app’s theme switch — switching between dark and light mode. It verifies that the toggle works, clicks through navigation links, and continues its exploratory crawl.After wrapping up the interactions, the agent summarizes its findings:From that list, it selects search functionality as the focus for the test it will generate.🎯 Note: You can tell the agent how many tests you want. In this case, I requested just one for the demo.🧾 Test Generation & Execution
The agent generates a full Playwright test file based on the interactions. It even fixes a lint error automatically before running the test.Here’s the test it generated:Once generated, it opens a terminal and runs the test. It passes ✅.We then open the Trace Viewer in VS Code to visually inspect the steps taken:It searched for Star Wars.Clicked through results like Deadpool.Verified titles on the movie details page.It’s a full cycle: exploration → generation → execution → review.💡 Why This Matters
This might seem like magic — but it’s a real example of AI-assisted development.Here’s what’s powerful about this approach:It caught a real bug I hadn’t seen.It saved me time writing boilerplate.It provided test coverage ideas based on actual usage paths.It produced runnable code I can commit right away or extend into more tests.You can iterate, refine the prompt, increase test count, or tell the agent to explore different areas. It’s like pairing with an AI-powered tester that never gets tired.🚀 Try It Yourself
If you're building modern apps and want better test coverage without writing everything by hand, this is your sign to give the Playwright MCP a try.Just point it at your app, give it a prompt, and let it explore.
You’ll be surprised what it finds — and how quickly you can go from zero tests to real coverage. Test out different models and see what works best for you. For this demo I used Claude Sonnet 3.7.Check out the video demo: 🧪 Happy testing — and let the bots write your tests. Let me know what you think in the comments and if you tried it out on your site and had some success. It may do things a little different depending on the model and version etc. Tip: In my  folder in a file called  I add this line of code so I don't have to click continue each time. It's great for demos.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Neuromorphic Computing: Powering the Next Generation of AI at the Edge</title><link>https://dev.to/vaib/neuromorphic-computing-powering-the-next-generation-of-ai-at-the-edge-40p4</link><author>Coder</author><category>ai</category><category>devto</category><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 18:26:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Neuromorphic Computing's Edge: Powering the Next Generation of AI in Resource-Constrained EnvironmentsThe relentless march of artificial intelligence has brought us to a critical juncture. As AI models grow in complexity and capability, so too do their demands for computational power and energy. This escalating requirement poses a significant challenge, particularly for AI applications designed to operate at the "edge" – directly on devices with limited resources, far from the vast data centers powering cloud AI. However, a quiet revolution is underway, one inspired by the most efficient computing system known: the human brain. Neuromorphic computing, with its brain-inspired architectures and event-driven processing, is emerging as the pivotal technology set to unlock the next generation of AI in these resource-constrained environments. Indeed, 2024 is proving to be a watershed year, witnessing the transition of these brain-inspired technologies from theoretical concepts to practical, commercialized solutions.Traditional computing architectures, based on the von Neumann principle, separate processing (CPU) from memory. This fundamental design necessitates constant data movement between these two units, leading to significant power consumption and latency, particularly for data-intensive AI tasks. For edge devices—such as smart sensors, wearables, and autonomous vehicles—these limitations are critical bottlenecks. Battery-powered devices cannot sustain the energy demands of continuous, complex AI computations, while latency in real-time applications like autonomous driving can have severe consequences. Furthermore, sending sensitive data to the cloud for processing raises considerable privacy concerns. Edge AI aims to mitigate these issues by performing computations locally, reducing reliance on cloud infrastructure and enhancing data security.
  
  
  Neuromorphic Fundamentals (Simplified)
Neuromorphic chips fundamentally diverge from traditional CPUs and GPUs. Instead of sequential, clock-driven operations, they mimic the brain's parallel, event-driven processing. In a neuromorphic system, neurons only "fire" or "spike" when a certain threshold of input is reached, much like biological neurons. This sparse, asynchronous communication dramatically reduces power consumption compared to conventional systems that continuously process all data. Moreover, neuromorphic architectures often integrate memory and processing, enabling "in-memory computing" which minimizes the energy-intensive data transfer associated with the von Neumann bottleneck.Consider a simplified illustration of event-driven processing:This conceptual snippet shows how a "spike" is generated only when the  exceeds a , contrasting with continuous data processing where every data point is processed regardless of its significance.The advancements in neuromorphic computing are deeply intertwined with breakthroughs in novel hardware components.
  
  
  Memristors and Analog In-Memory Computing
Central to the efficiency of neuromorphic systems are emerging memory technologies like memristors. These components can store and process information simultaneously, enabling computation directly where data resides. This "in-memory computing" paradigm drastically reduces the energy and time spent moving data, a major bottleneck in traditional architectures. The inherent noise and variation in memristor nanodevices can even be exploited for energy-efficient on-chip learning, as highlighted in the Nature Collection: Neuromorphic Hardware and Computing 2024.Here's a conceptual representation of in-memory operation:This code illustrates the idea that data () and computational parameters () are conceptually co-located, allowing for direct computation without explicit data transfers.
  
  
  Spiking Neural Processors (SNNs)
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a core component of many neuromorphic chips. Unlike traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) that process continuous values, SNNs communicate using discrete "spikes," mimicking the way biological neurons transmit information. This event-driven nature leads to ultra-low power consumption, making them highly suitable for edge AI. Companies like Innatera are at the forefront of this development, with their Spiking Neural Processor T1, unveiled in January 2024, demonstrating significantly lower energy consumption (500 times less than conventional approaches) and faster pattern recognition speeds (100 times faster than competitors) for complex AI tasks. Innatera's approach, as detailed by Sumeet Kumar, CEO and founder, in an Impact Lab interview, combines an event-driven computing engine with a conventional CNN accelerator and RISC-V CPU, showcasing a comprehensive platform for ultra-low-power AI in battery-powered devices.
  
  
  Photonic Neuromorphic Computing
Beyond electronics, photonic neuromorphic computing explores the use of light for even faster and more energy-efficient processing. By encoding data in physical quantities like light, these systems offer a promising alternative for probabilistic computing and can achieve high computational speeds with minimal energy expenditure. Research in this area is rapidly advancing, with systems demonstrating ultrafast speeds and energy efficiencies orders of magnitude greater than digital processors.
  
  
  Real-World Applications & Use Cases
The unique advantages of neuromorphic computing are poised to revolutionize various sectors:: Neuromorphic chips can enable always-on, intelligent sensing in smart homes, industrial monitoring, and environmental sensing. For instance, Innatera's partnership with Socionext for human presence detection uses radar sensors combined with neuromorphic chips, offering highly efficient and privacy-preserving solutions for devices like video doorbells. This non-imaging approach allows for continuous monitoring with minimal power, activating cameras only when necessary.Robotics & Autonomous Systems: Real-time perception, navigation, and decision-making are crucial for drones, autonomous vehicles, and industrial robots. Neuromorphic systems can process sensory data with extreme efficiency and low latency, enabling more agile and responsive autonomous operations. The "Frontiers in Neuroscience" collection highlights how neuromorphic technology can lead to embodied intelligent robotics.Wearable Devices & Healthcare: Personalized health monitoring, early disease detection, and advanced prosthetics can greatly benefit from the low-power, real-time processing capabilities of neuromorphic chips. These systems can analyze biometric data continuously without draining device batteries, providing crucial insights for preventative care and assistive technologies.: The burgeoning field of Large Language Models (LLMs) currently demands immense computational resources. Neuromorphic computing offers the potential to run smaller, more efficient LLMs directly on devices, enabling offline and private AI interactions. This could lead to personalized AI assistants that understand and respond to natural language without constant cloud connectivity.
  
  
  Challenges and the Road Ahead
Despite the immense promise, neuromorphic computing still faces hurdles. Programming these brain-inspired architectures can be more complex than traditional software development, requiring new tools and paradigms. Standardization across different hardware platforms is also crucial for wider adoption and interoperability. The "Nature Collection: Neuromorphic Hardware and Computing 2024" emphasizes the need for addressing challenges in programming and deployment at scale to achieve commercial success. However, companies like Innatera are actively addressing this by providing developer-friendly SDKs that integrate with existing frameworks like PyTorch, significantly lowering the barrier to entry for developers.The long-term impact of neuromorphic computing on AI development is profound. By bridging the gap between theoretical neuroscience and practical hardware, these technologies pave the way for truly ubiquitous, intelligent systems that can operate with unprecedented energy efficiency and real-time responsiveness. As research continues to advance in areas like probabilistic photonic computing and novel memristor technologies, the potential for brain-scale simulations and AI systems that can learn and adapt with human-like efficiency becomes increasingly tangible. The journey towards a future where AI is seamlessly integrated into every facet of our lives, from smart infrastructure to personalized healthcare, is being powered by the quiet revolution of neuromorphic computing.
