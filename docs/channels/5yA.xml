You can use it without stress even in situations where real-time response is required.: Excels in science, math, coding, and a variety of engineering specialities.Developer-oriented features: Equipped with long-awaited features, such as function calls, structured output, and developer messages, enhancing usability as an engineering tool.Flexible inference options: Three inference effort options are available: low, medium, and high. You can choose the best performance for your situation.: It maintains the low cost and low latency of the o1-mini while providing more advanced features, making it cost-effective and accessible to a wide range of users.By the way, what is the performance difference between this and the O1 Pro? Of course, this is just a matter of usage, so a strict comparison cannot be made.But the O1 Pro is slow to begin with. No matter what code you’re working on, even if you give detailed instructions for each function, it usually takes about 3 minutes.It requires a lot of writing code, so it’s not very practical on the O1 Pro.That’s why the o3-mini is by far the easiest to use.If there was a situation where the o3-mini-high would give an error, I thought I would try using the o1 pro, but so far I haven’t gotten any errors so I can’t compare themQwen 2.5 Max is a particularly high-performance version of the series and has attracted attention for demonstrating benchmark scores that surpass DeepSeek V3. Its main features are its inference speed and ability to handle a variety of tasks, as well as enhanced integration with external services and plugins.Qwen 2.5 Max integrates not only language understanding but also image and video generation functions. This gives it the flexibility to handle not only text-based dialogue but also multimodal inputSo, what exactly is the Qwen2.5-Max? Below are its main features.Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) ArchitectureUnlike typical transformer-based language models, this architecture uses a combination of multiple “expert” sub-models, making it easier to optimize for specific tasks and improving processing efficiency and accuracy.: Pre-training is performed on more than 20 trillion tokens, giving it the ability to understand and generate language across a wide range of domains. It has the advantage of being able to handle a wide range of fields because it greedily learns from all kinds of text data, including news articles, academic papers, and social media posts.Advanced fine-tuning (SFT and RLHF)By combining SFT (supervised fine-tuning) and RLHF (reinforcement learning based on human feedback), we have created a mechanism to generate responses that users expect more accurately and naturally. This makes it possible to respond in a way that takes into account the user’s “preferences” and “intentions,” rather than simply reproducing training data.: Access is possible via API using Alibaba Cloud’s Model Studio service. It also supports OpenAI-compatible APIs, so it is highly compatible with existing development environments and tools, and you can expect quick implementation and expansion.I couldn’t hold myself to compare it with the domestic large model DeepSeek R1 that has swept the entire large model circle.This time, we will verify the following items.

All the code is incorrect. For example, DeepSeek-R1 has a problem with the 100 balls — if you look at the GIF, you will see that DeepSeek-R1 misses the ball inside the circle. O3-Mini generates 100 balls, but the circle is unclear because it has a grey background. Qwen2.5-Max excels at generating the circle and 100 balls but has a size issue, making them look bigger than expected.In conclusion, I would say that all these models require human intervention, as they cannot generate correct code with a single prompt.Factorize the number 1757051 and explain why it is a good example 
to test a human's ability to factorize this.Deepseek-r1 and o3-mini generate correct answers, but o3-mini is not as good at reasoning as Deepseek-r1. Even when the question is correct, the o3-mini lacks some formulas and misses important details. Qwen2.5-Max fails to generate the correct question. Personally, if I have a complex math question, I would prefer to use Deepseek-r1.o3-mini is still far behind Deepseek, Deepseek-R1 is better at deep reasoning and complex task processing, especially in deep thinking, R1 not only has powerful performance but also has a lower price.The Chat version of r1 is free and unlimited, while the Chat version of o3-mini is available to free members, but it is severely limited. It is just a trial version.The API price of o3-mini is $1.1 for input and $4.4 for output, while r1 is 0.55 and $2.19. o3-mini is exactly twice that of r1Even o3-mini is better at coding, but I will not use it for codingPersonally, I think Deepseek-r1 (math) & Claude (coding), who used ❤ to represent life, is the winner.🧙‍♂️ I am an !

At Microsoft, I have been deeply involved in big data, telemetry and observability, leading efforts to improve system reliability and operational efficiency. My expertise spans data engineering, AI, machine learning, and open telemetry, and I am passionate about leveraging emerging technologies to optimize workflows. Having witnessed firsthand the challenges of incident management and the strain it places on on-call engineers, I see AI as a game-changer in streamlining incident response. You can learn more about me here.In this blog, I’ll explore how agentic AI can reduce the on-call burden by automating critical steps in issue diagnosis and resolution. While I have implemented some of this at my current company, I'm sharing generic information on all the possibilities using Agentic AI, without sharing anything proprietary. 
  
  
  Incidents or Support tickets
In today's fast-paced digital landscape, on-call engineers play a pivotal role in maintaining system reliability and swiftly addressing incidents. However, the traditional workflow—from customer support identifying an issue to engineers diagnosing and resolving it—often involves multiple back-and-forth communications, leading to delays and increased workloads. Enter AI: autonomous systems capable of making decisions and performing tasks without human intervention. By integrating AI into incident response processes, organizations can streamline operations, reduce on-call burdens, and enhance overall efficiency.
  
  
  The Traditional Incident Response Workflow
Typically, when a field issue arises, the process follows these steps: A customer encounters a problem and contacts the support team. Customer support collects details about the issue. If unresolved, the issue escalates to an on-call engineer. The engineer seeks critical information:

When did the issue occur?Are all necessary information available to query logs or debug further? Missing details require reverting to customer support, who then contact the customer again. With complete information, the engineer analyzes logs to identify and rectify the root cause.This iterative process can cause significant delays, increased workloads, and frustration for both customers and support teams.
  
  
  Introducing Agentic AI into Incident Response
Agentic AI systems autonomously perform tasks, make decisions, and adapt to changing environments without human input. In the context of incident response, agentic AI can revolutionize the traditional workflow by:Automated Issue Detection and Classification: AI-driven tools continuously monitor systems, identifying anomalies before they escalate into significant issues. By analyzing patterns and deviations, these tools can detect potential problems early, reducing the frequency of critical incidents.  Upon detecting an issue, AI systems can classify its severity and potential impact, ensuring that critical problems receive immediate attention while filtering out false positives.Enhanced Data Collection and Analysis:Contextual Data Gathering: Agentic AI can automatically collect relevant data—such as timestamps, system logs, and user actions—at the moment an issue is detected, ensuring that on-call engineers have all necessary information upfront. By analyzing aggregated data, AI can identify patterns and pinpoint the underlying causes of issues, providing engineers with actionable insights.Automated Communication and Resolution: AI-powered virtual assistants can engage with customers in real-time, gathering essential details about the issue through natural language processing, reducing the need for multiple back-and-forth communications. For known issues, agentic AI can execute predefined solutions, resolving problems without human intervention and only escalating to on-call engineers when necessary. 
  
  
  Benefits of Agentic AI in Reducing On-Call Burden
Integrating agentic AI into incident response workflows offers several advantages: Automated detection and data collection expedite the initial phases of incident management, allowing for quicker resolutions. By handling routine tasks and minor issues autonomously, AI frees up engineers to focus on more complex problems, reducing burnout and improving job satisfaction.

It's a common debate that drives developers to extremes—either avoiding AI entirely or frantically signing up for every AI course available.
  
  
  Why This Conversation Matters
However, it's not a hypothetical or frivolous concern. Companies  making hiring decisions based on AI productivity. Salesforce's CEO recently announced plans to reduce hiring software and support engineers after seeing a 30% productivity boost from AI.As a Developer Advocate in AI, my public response has always been to upskill and adapt to the changing economy. After all, you wouldn't want to be the person insisting on driving a horse and buggy while everyone else has moved on to cars.I believe that AI  a helpful tool. I've used it to understand new technologies and quickly prototype ideas. But internally, I've wrestled with a different question: Why do we keep framing AI primarily as a replacement for human beings?
  
  
  How AI Marketing Shaped This Perception
My spicy take is that our industry helped shape this narrative. We inadvertently leaned into a lazy marketing strategy prioritizing quick wins over sustainable adoption. It's easier to tell VCs and executives that your AI tool replaces developers than to demonstrate how it augments developer capabilities.
  
  
  Anthropomorphism Is Not All Bad
Anthropomorphism is the practice of assigning human traits to non-human entities. It isn't inherently problematic. In fact, it's a common practice in tech. Thoughtful anthropomorphism makes digital experiences more intuitive and helps users embrace new interfaces. For example: E-books mirror traditional reading experiences by simulating page-turning animations, even though there's no physical page to turn.Electric cars (as Sunil Pai pointed out to me) play pre-recorded engine sounds when they start, providing a familiar affordance for drivers.In these cases, users don't actually believe their e-book contains paper or that their electric car has a combustion engine. But, AI presents a unique challenge. Its complexity and "black box" nature make it harder for users to grasp its true capabilities and limitations. To bridge this knowledge gap, companies lean heavily into human-like descriptions:
  
  
  Devin is an "AI Software Engineer."
While these descriptions make AI feel more familiar, the drawback is that they can also mislead users to believe that AI can think, reason, and work independently like humans.
  
  
  The Problem with Marketing AI as a Human
Anthropomorphic AI marketing is sometimes a form of self-sabotage because:When AI is marketed as an "engineer" or "developer, " decision-makers view it as a one-to-one substitute for human talent.This is counterproductive because developers are some of the most valuable users of AI tools. They are the users who know how to use AI and contribute to the ecosystem effectively. According to the 2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, 76% of developers currently use or plan to incorporate AI into their workflows. However, our industry's marketing suggests that using AI and contributing to the ecosystem will eventually put AI in a place to take their jobs. So why would they want to further the movement?
  
  
  It Sets Unrealistic Expectations
If an AI tool is marketed as "just like a human," users will expect it to perform at human levels.AI is a non-sentient tool that processes historical data patterns, is prone to hallucinating, misses important context, and provides non-deterministic output.When developers realize it's not as good as the marketing implied, the company and product risk losing credibility. Developers are notorious for valuing authenticity. Over-exaggeration or misrepresentation in marketing only drives developers away.One survey participant shared their reflections: "I have a PhD in AI, worked to develop some of the algorithms used by generative AI. I deeply regret how naively I offered up my contributions."Another participant stated, "We should use generative AI to help people be faster at their jobs, not lose them."
  
  
  It Misses the Real Value Proposition
The real value of AI developer tools includes automating boring tasks, faster prototyping, and quicker debugging, which leaves more time for creative problem-solving.And now, AI enthusiasts have dubbed 2025 as the Year of the Agent. In short, AI agents are tools that can autonomously take action on our behalf, like executing shell commands, creating calendar events, and building applications. But as we move from LLMs that suggestion code to us to more autonomous agents, anthropomorphic marketing is only increasing.
  
  
  Framework for Effectively Marketing AI Agents to Developers
Here's how to market AI developer tools in a way that both builds trust and differentiates your Agent in an oversaturated market:If you work in Developer Relations, Sales, Marketing, or as an executive promoting an AI agent, you're probably representing a product you didn't build. This means you may not fully understand how the tool works, its true capabilities, or its limitations. Developers have a knack for spotting misrepresentation or inauthentic marketing.You can mitigate this challenge by:Becoming customer zero 

Use the product extensively before it reaches the publicInvesting time in learning the following fundamentals:

LLMs and their capabilitiesKey differences between Copilots and AgentsCore AI Agent operations and your product's unique approachToken handling and context managementPoints requiring human interventionYour product's agentic loop. For example, some agents use the following loop: 

Share requests and available tools with an LLMReceive LLM's execution planExecute the plan and tool callsVerify results with the LLMRevise and re-execute if neededDeliver final results to the user and wait for the user's requestI used these two resources to help me understand AI agents:It might be difficult to eliminate anthropomorphism entirely, especially since it is useful. My advice is to use it sparingly. Skip titles like "AI Engineer" or "AI Teammate." Choose names that set clear expectations, like Copilot, Agent, or Assistant. GitHub's use of "Copilot" and "AI Pair Programming Assistant" exemplifies this balance because it suggests collaboration while keeping humans in control. 
  
  
  Augmentation > Replacement
Let's understand who developers are. They're not rockstar/ninja/10x developers. Those stereotypes are so 2014.  Developers juggle multiple roles – they're parents, open source maintainers, bootcamp instructors, and more. AI agents shine brightest when they complement these diverse responsibilities, taking on parallel tasks while developers focus on high-impact work. Instead of marketing your tools as whole substitutes for developers, position them as tools part of a developer's toolkit.If possible, go open source. If not, find ways to explain the architecture through whitepapers and conference talks. This approach will help your users understand that it's not magic so they can determine how to use the product and get the best performance from it. Many times, when there's a lack of transparency, developers will theorize how they think it works and create their own narrative, which can backfire on your product. I remember this happened in the early days of GitHub Copilot. I would hop into Twitter Spaces, where people would share how they thought it worked, but they were wrong and spreading misinformation.You can build trust with developers by putting them in control of their workflow. Here are some of my suggestions:Similar to how developers choose IDE settings, allow developers to choose their preferred LLM models and customize the Agent's behavior and verbosity.Show what actions the Agent will take before executing them and provide detailed logs for debugging.Provide APIs and hooks so the Agent fits into existing workflows. codename goose is my favorite example of this, although I'm biased because it's an agent my company made. It's open source. Goose, as it's fondly called, lets developers choose their LLM model and extensions via Model Context Protocol. Developers can also choose to interact with the Agent via the CLI or GUI.Instead of making false promises, demonstrate your AI agent's value through concrete examples. Create short, engaging video demos, GIFs, or blog posts showing the Agent in action:Creating and running test suitesConverting code between languagesTransforming wireframes into interactive UIsGenerating API documentation from code commentsAutomating environment setupDon't be afraid to demo live and make it fun so it can be memorable! When I worked at GitHub, I used to demo GitHub Copilot at conferences. I would prompt GitHub Copilot to post a tweet that said, "I wrote this tweet with Copilot." It was a short and simple demo that was memorable for attendees and sparked curiosity from those who weren't there.: Demoing generative AI tools live is scary because the output is non-deterministic. If your live demo fails, that's even better because you can use it as a teaching moment. Show how you work around issues and where human expertise adds value. This authenticity builds more trust than a perfectly polished demo ever could.Documentation often determines whether developers adopt your tool. Strong documentation for your Agent could include:Accurate technical specifications of model training and limitationsComprehensive feature guidesClear explanations of data usage and privacyBuild product credibility by fostering an ecosystem where developers can learn from each other, and you can learn from them. You can do this by:Using platforms like GitHub Discussions and Discord to create spaces for feedback and supportEncouraging knowledge sharing by letting developers exchange prompts, best practices, and integrationsRecognizing community contributionsMaintaining a transparent feedback loop to show that you value developer inputA great example is Cursor.directory - a platform by and for the community where developers share  prompts.Our presentation of AI shapes how the world perceives and uses it. Let's move beyond the tired question of whether AI will replace developers and focus on how it can augment developer capabilities.Share your thoughts below!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Magic of Embeddings: How AI Understands Language Like Humans</title><link>https://dev.to/kumarprateek18/the-magic-of-embeddings-how-ai-understands-language-like-humans-741</link><author>Prateek kumar</author><category>ai</category><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 03:10:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ever wondered how AI chatbots generate relevant, intelligent responses in real-time? The secret lies in —the technology that enables AI to understand and process language, images, and data like humans. These powerful numerical representations allow AI to  meaningful content, forming the backbone of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).In this blog, we’ll explore what embeddings are, how they work, and why they are crucial for AI-driven applications like chatbots, search engines, and recommendation systems.Embeddings are numerical representations of words, sentences, images, or documents in a high-dimensional space. They allow AI models to capture semantic relationships between different pieces of data. Instead of using plain text, AI converts these elements into vectors (arrays of numbers), enabling efficient comparison and retrieval.Why Are Embeddings Important?Traditional keyword-based search methods rely on exact word matches, which have major limitations:They fail to understand synonyms (e.g., "car" and "automobile" are considered different words).They do not capture contextual meaning (e.g., "bank" as a financial institution vs. "bank" as a riverbank).They struggle with large datasets, making searches inefficient.Embeddings solve these problems by representing words, phrases, and documents as vectors in a mathematical space, allowing AI systems to find similarities based on meaning rather than exact wording.How Are Embeddings Used in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?One of the most powerful applications of embeddings is in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG combines retrieval (finding relevant data) with generation (creating responses using an LLM) to produce intelligent, context-aware answers. Documents are split into smaller chunks and transformed into embeddings. When a user asks a question, the system converts the query into an embedding and finds the most relevant chunks. The retrieved chunks are provided as context to an LLM (like GPT-4), which generates a response based on the retrieved knowledge.RAG ensures that AI models can access up-to-date, domain-specific knowledge while maintaining  in responses, making it ideal for chatbots, search engines, and enterprise AI applications.How Are Embeddings Created?Embeddings are generated using machine learning models trained on vast amounts of text or image data. Some popular models include: (for fast similarity search)Mathematical RepresentationEach word or sentence is represented as a point in an N-dimensional space. The closer two vectors are in this space, the more similar they are in meaning. For example:Here, "king" and "queen" have similar embeddings, while "apple" is farther apart, indicating that it belongs to a different concept.How Are Embeddings Used in AI Applications?1. AI Chatbots and Custom Data SearchWhen building an AI chatbot that understands company-specific documents, embeddings help by:Splitting documents into .Converting chunks into .Storing embeddings in a  (e.g., ChromaDB, Pinecone, FAISS).Converting user queries into  and retrieving relevant document chunks.Passing the retrieved data to an LLM (Large Language Model) for response generation.2. Similarity Search & Information RetrievalInstead of searching by keywords, AI can retrieve documents or images by . When a user queries a system, the system:Converts the query into an embedding.Searches for similar embeddings in the vector database.Returns the most relevant documents, even if they use different words.3. Recommendation SystemsSpotify, Netflix, and YouTube use embeddings to recommend content:If you watch sci-fi movies, the system retrieves other movies with similar embeddings.Music streaming services recommend songs based on user-listened embeddings.4. Search Engine Optimization (SEO)Google’s search algorithm heavily relies on embeddings to rank pages by  rather than exact keyword matches.Mathematical Explanation of Similarity SearchTo find similar embeddings, AI systems use , which measures the angle between two vectors.Formula for Cosine Similarity:cos(θ) = (A · B) / (||A|| * ||B||).(||A||) and (||B||) are the  of the vectors.If , the vectors are identical (perfect match). If , the vectors are unrelated.This allows AI to find the most relevant text, images, or documents efficiently.Building a Simple AI Chatbot with EmbeddingsUsing OpenAI’s Embeddings APIUsing LangChain and ChromaDB for Vector SearchConclusion: Why Embeddings Are a Game-Changer✅ Embeddings allow AI to "understand" language mathematically.
✅ They make similarity search fast and scalable.
✅ They enable AI to retrieve and use relevant information dynamically.
✅ They power many AI applications, from chatbots to recommendation systems.By leveraging embeddings and vector databases, businesses can enhance AI applications with custom knowledge and deliver smarter, context-aware responses.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Unlocking Your Brand&apos;s True Potential: How AI Search Grading Reveals the Path to Digital Dominance</title><link>https://dev.to/seosiri/unlocking-your-brands-true-potential-how-ai-search-grading-reveals-the-path-to-digital-dominance-52nh</link><author>Momenul Ahmad</author><category>ai</category><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 02:49:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Decoding the Language of Your Brand's Online PresenceIn today's hyper-competitive digital landscape, your brand's success hinges on more than just keywords.

From conversational AI to text generation, these models have shown incredible promise in a variety of applications. But what's behind their power? In this blog, we'll be exploring the world of LangChain, an open-source framework that's pushing the boundaries of what's possible with language models.LangChain is an open-source framework built on top of the Hugging Face Transformers library. It provides a flexible and modular way to work with language models, allowing developers to easily integrate them into their applications. With LangChain, you can create custom workflows that combine multiple language models to achieve complex tasks.The Power of Language Models 💪Language models are trained on vast amounts of text data, learning patterns and relationships between words.

One of the comments a recent post related to the topic was about why using Python for ingestion instead of .NET. That was a personal preference at the time but also using .NET with Semantic Kernel to ingest documents for a simple pipeline is not necessarily any more work. In this post, we will go through the ingestion process utilising high level libraries available to us in .NET ecosystem..NET Semantic Kernel and related connectors for managing vector storeLangChain .NET for chunking.NET Aspire to bring it all together using one of the Inference APIs. (Ollama on host, Ollama as container managed by ASPIRE or OpenAI)In the Python version, we can either pull the documents from a GitHub Repository or use a file generated by GitIngest UI. HitIngest is an open source library allowing consumers to integrate ability to scrape public repositories from GitHub or manually downloading a file using the Web UI linked earlier.The ingestion process in this example is straightforward and we follow the steps illustrated below. As we are using a single file containing multiple .md and .yml files as described above, first step is to split them into filename, file content pairs. The files are separated by headers as following:... content
================================================
File: README.md
================================================
... content
Given this is a throw away example, code below is just enough to demonstrate the process without much distractions.Now that we have a Dictionary of file names and file content, we now need to get chinks for the file contents.
  
  
  Getting embedding for the chunks
We are using Semantic Kernel so this part is straightforward and will work with whichever API we chose to use. Given we have so far split the file, and got the chunks for each document, we can use the registered ITextEmbeddingGenerationService (this is driven by app and aspire configuration) to compute the embeddings using the inference approach we have configured.We also have some custom metrics we are tracking that are visible on Aspire Dashboard as we perform ingestion.Now that we have the embeddings, we need to insert them. This process involves a few steps:Mapping a .NET class to a vector store documentEnsuring the Collection exists (optionally recreated)Using correct dimensions for the collection which depends on what embedding model we use.We can use attributes for mapping but in this demo we can use multiple embedding models and they have different dimensions for embedding vectors so using attributes would mean hardcoding these. We can however define our  VectorStoreRecordDefinition in code so that we can at runtime chose the correct dimensions for our collection. When bootstrapping we can then use our factory and register it with .NET Semantic Kernel so whenever we inject and  we will have our mappers integrated in the pipeline.        var options = new QdrantVectorStoreOptions
        {
            HasNamedVectors = true,
            VectorStoreCollectionFactory = new QdrantCollectionFactory(embeddingModelName)
        };
        kernelBuilder.AddQdrantVectorStore(options: options);
    }

  
  
  Inserting vectors to our collection
Once we handle the registration and configuration, we are ready to consume  in our code and make use of it. So in our IngestionPipeline.cs we need to perform the following:Ensure collection exits:

Create if it does not or recreate if required.Insert the vectors as below:
In this quick post we have covered using TextSplitters from LangChain .NET, Vector Stores and Embedding models via .NET Semantic Kernel and some custom metrics captured during ingestion.Without much code, we can get impressive results using what is available to us in .NET world and if you would like to see the results here is how to:Use  configuration in the AppHost Project.Wait for models to one downloaded and startedThen use the src/AspireRagDemo.API/AspireRagDemo.API.http and execute http://localhost:5026/ingest?fileName=dotnet-docs-aspire.txt call. Depending on model size and CPU, tis can take somewhere between 30 seconds to 15 minutes.Once ingestion completed, access the UI from Aspire Dashboard and run some Aspire Related queries.In addition, feel free to explore the metrics as below:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Novel Optimization Algorithms: From Entertainment to Military Applications</title><link>https://dev.to/_hm/novel-optimization-algorithms-from-entertainment-to-military-applications-22h5</link><author>Hussein Mahdi</author><category>ai</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 18:22:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[My passion lies in developing military applications, driven by the field's cutting-edge technological advancements and strategic importance.

RAG? Gemini Flash 2.0 Might Just Have Revolutionized AI (Again) - Is Retrieval Augmented Generation Obsolete?</title><link>https://dev.to/shaman_shetty/rip-rag-gemini-flash-20-might-just-have-revolutionized-ai-again-is-retrieval-augmented-e5k</link><author>Shaman Shetty</author><category>ai</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 18:07:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[You clicked because you're in the AI trenches, right? You're wrestling with Large Language Models (LLMs), trying to make them actually useful for real-world applications. And chances are, you've heard the buzz around Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). It was supposed to be the holy grail, the key to unlocking truly knowledgeable and reliable AI.Well, buckle up, because the ground is shifting. Faster than you can say "context window,"  has arrived, and it's throwing a serious wrench into the RAG machine. Dare I say, it might even be… Okay, maybe "killing" is dramatic. But as a writer and AI enthusiast, I’m seeing a seismic shift. And if you’re building AI applications, you need to pay attention.First, a Quick RAG Refresher (For the Uninitiated):Imagine an LLM as a brilliant but slightly forgetful savant. It knows language inside and out, but its knowledge of the world is limited to what it was trained on. **RAG **is like giving that savant a constantly updated encyclopedia.: When you ask a question, RAG first searches a vast external knowledge base (think documents, databases, websites).: It then injects the relevant information it finds into the prompt it sends to the LLM.: The LLM, now armed with fresh, context-specific knowledge, generates a more informed and accurate answer.RAG was brilliant in theory and often effective in practice. It allowed us to:Overcome LLM knowledge cut-offs: Access information beyond the training data.Improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations: Ground answers in verifiable facts.Customize knowledge for specific domains: Tailor AI to niche industries and datasets.So, what's the problem? Why is Gemini Flash 2.0 potentially turning RAG into yesterday's news?Enter Gemini Flash 2.0: The Context KingThe core issue with RAG, despite its ingenuity, is its inherent complexity and overhead. It's like adding a complex plumbing system to your AI application. It works, but it’s… well, complex., on the other hand, takes a drastically different approach. Its game-changing feature? A MASSIVE context window.We're talking about . Let that sink in. That's enough to feed entire books, research papers, and vast swathes of data directly into the model's prompt.Suddenly, the need for external retrieval shrinks dramatically. Gemini Flash 2.0 can effectively become its own RAG system, internally digesting and processing huge amounts of information within a single prompt.Here's why this is a potential  from a practical perspective:Simplicity and Efficiency: Forget building complex retrieval pipelines, indexing knowledge bases, and managing data flow between systems. Gemini Flash 2.0 streamlines everything. You feed it the data, and it just… knows. This means faster development, simpler deployment, and less maintenance. RAG solutions often require significant infrastructure to manage the knowledge base, retrieval mechanisms, and data processing. Gemini Flash 2.0, with its massive context window, potentially reduces this overhead significantly. You're paying for a powerful model, not a complex ecosystem around it.Speed and Real-time Access: RAG introduces latency. There's a delay for retrieval, processing, and augmentation before the LLM even generates the answer. Gemini Flash 2.0, with its internalized knowledge, can potentially provide faster, near real-time responses, as the relevant information is already within its processing scope.Reduced Complexity for Developers: Let's be honest, implementing and fine-tuning RAG can be a developer headache. Gemini Flash 2.0 promises to simplify AI development, allowing developers to focus on the core application logic rather than the intricate data plumbing.Customer Service Chatbots: Instead of RAG searching FAQs and knowledge articles, you could feed a vast, updated knowledge base directly into Gemini Flash 2.0's context window. Instant, accurate answers, no external retrieval needed.Research and Analysis Tools: Researchers could feed entire libraries of documents into Gemini Flash 2.0 and have it analyze and synthesize information in ways previously unimaginable without complex RAG setups.Content Creation and Summarization: Feed massive datasets, reports, or even books into Gemini Flash 2.0 and have it generate summaries, extract key insights, or create derivative content, all without the overhead of external retrieval.Is RAG Completely Dead? Probably Not (Yet).Let's be realistic. RAG might still have a niche in specific scenarios:Extremely Dynamic and Volatile Data: If your knowledge base changes constantly in real-time (think stock prices or live social media feeds), a RAG system might still be beneficial for grabbing the absolute latest information. However, even here, Gemini Flash 2.0's speed might surprise us.Highly Specialized and Segmented Knowledge: In scenarios where you need to access very specific, siloed knowledge bases with strict access controls, RAG might offer more granular control.Cost Considerations (Potentially): While Gemini Flash 2.0 promises efficiency, the cost of processing massive context windows could be a factor. For extremely low-budget, basic applications, simpler RAG implementations might still be considered.But the writing is on the wall. The trend in LLMs is towards larger context windows. Gemini Flash 2.0 is just the first major player to truly unleash this potential. As context windows grow even larger, the argument for complex, external RAG systems becomes increasingly weak.. And Gemini Flash 2.0 is leading the charge.What does this mean for you?If you're currently building RAG systems, it's time to seriously evaluate Gemini Flash 2.0. Explore its capabilities and see if it can simplify your architecture and improve performance.If you're just starting to explore AI applications, consider Gemini Flash 2.0 as a powerful and potentially simpler alternative to RAG-heavy approaches.Keep an eye on the context window race. As other models follow suit, the entire AI landscape will be reshaped.This isn't just an incremental improvement. It feels like a paradigm shift. Gemini Flash 2.0 isn't just another LLM; it's potentially redefining how we build and deploy AI. And for RAG, it might just be the beginning of the end.What are your thoughts? Is RAG doomed? Is Gemini Flash 2.0 truly a game-changer? Let's discuss in the comments below!I hope you enjoyed reading.I definitely had a lot of fun writing this😎. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hinton: &quot;I thought JD Vance&apos;s statement was ludicrous nonsense conveying a total lack of understanding of the dangers of AI ... this alliance between AI companies and the US government is very scary because this administration has no concern for AI safety.&quot;</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1iqy8te/hinton_i_thought_jd_vances_statement_was/</link><author>/u/MetaKnowing</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 18:04:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Another LLM wrapper</title><link>https://dev.to/alessiochiffi/another-llm-wrapper-44h5</link><author>alessiochiffi</author><category>ai</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 17:51:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Like many of us, I have been fascinated by the capabilities of tools like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Claude and so on. As someone who loves coding and trying new tools, I wanted to explore what these models can offer via their APIs.I previously experimented with OpenAI so I wanted to try something different. I opted for Google Gemini AI mainly because of its generous free tier and low costs.My aim was to create a simple proof-of-concept (POC) page to check grammatical errors by pasting or typing text into a text box and receiving feedback from the AI. I quickly set up the app with the following tech stack:I then started by creating an API endpoint - using Nuxt’s server/api folder - to manage all LLM interactions server side.
  
  
  🔌 11 lines of code to connect to the model
After defining the model, I could send instructions to the model, along with the text provided by the user in the frontend app. Below is a simplified version of the function that initiates a chat with the model.The frontend is made by a simple form with a textbox and a 'Submit' button where the user can type or paste text.We then send a request to the API endpoint created, which processes it with Gemini AI and returns the results back to the frontend.On the dashboard’s right panel, the response provides a summary and suggested changes, when availableOne standout feature of Google Gemini's API is its support for custom response schemas. Using this feature, I could configure the model to indicate whether a sentence is grammatically correct and, if not, to provide a corrected version.Here’s the schema I used:For example, when evaluating the sentence: “Their going to be here soon.” the model returns:This structured output makes it easy to process and display results in the frontend.It's interesting that you can also describe each property and what you expect from the response using the description key within the schema object. It certainly feels like writing this short post to share my journey took longer than implementing the LLM model itself.Although my knowledge of AI is limited, I see immense potential in this technology. With much of the complexity abstracted away, we can focus on building products and exploring endless opportunities for innovation. Whether it’s a tool that simplifies our day-to-day tasks or a larger, more ambitious project, we can only embrace the possibilities this technology offers.Cover image from Novoto Studio]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hugging Face Launches Free AI Agents Course with Certification!</title><link>https://dev.to/fardinkai/hugging-face-launches-free-ai-agents-course-with-certification-g5a</link><author>Mahmud Ahad Abedin Fardin</author><category>ai</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 17:38:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hugging Face Launches Free AI Agents Course with Certification!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hugging Face Launches Free AI Agents Course with Certification!</title><link>https://dev.to/riana-azad/hugging-face-launches-free-ai-agents-course-with-certification-2h7n</link><author>Riana Azad</author><category>ai</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 17:22:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hugging Face has introduced a free , complete with a certification to help you validate your skills.

A great Hunger Game Simulator goes beyond the basic premise of a fight to the death. While the fundamental goal remains to survive and outlast the competition, what truly sets the best games apart is their depth and complexity. A strong Hunger Game Simulator must include a variety of elements that challenge players' survival instincts, strategic thinking, and adaptability.
Key Aspects of a Great Hunger Game Simulator
Realistic survival elements: Managing hunger, health, stamina, and other survival factors adds realism and urgency to the game.
Diverse environments: Multiple arenas with varying environmental conditions encourage diverse strategies and replayability.
Character progression and customization: Players should have the ability to upgrade and personalize their characters, making each playthrough unique.
Dynamic gameplay: Random events, environmental hazards, and interactions with AI or other players create an ever-changing experience.
Survivor's Edge embodies all these characteristics, offering an exciting and multifaceted Hunger Game Simulator experience that stands out from the crowd.Key Features of Survivor's Edge: The Hunger Games Experience
3.1 Character Customization
One of the highlights of Survivor's Edge: The Hunger Games Experience is its in-depth character customization system. Players are given the opportunity to create and shape their character from the ground up, selecting not just appearance but also traits and abilities. Whether you want to play as a stealthy and nimble character or a powerhouse who excels in combat, the game allows for a wide variety of styles.
Customization goes beyond just visual aesthetics—it directly impacts how the character performs in the arena. For example, players can choose their character’s strength, endurance, agility, and intelligence, which affects how they interact with the environment and deal with challenges. This personalization allows for a unique Hunger Game Simulator experience each time, as players can experiment with different builds and strategies.

The design of the arena in Survivor's Edge is a critical aspect that sets the game apart. Rather than offering a single, static arena, the game features multiple dynamic environments, each with its own challenges and opportunities. The arenas are beautifully crafted and designed to evoke a sense of urgency and danger, with different zones providing varying degrees of cover, obstacles, and hazards.
For instance, some arenas might be lush forests filled with resources and hiding spots, while others could be desolate wastelands where survival is more about scrounging for what little you can find. The changing weather, day-night cycles, and natural disasters like fires or floods make each arena feel alive and unpredictable, forcing players to adapt on the fly.
This level of immersion enhances the Hunger Game Simulator experience, making the environment an active participant in the battle for survival.
3.3 Dynamic Survival Mechanics
Survival isn’t just about outlasting your opponents in Survivor’s Edge—it’s about thriving in the harsh conditions of the arena. The game introduces dynamic survival mechanics that require players to think strategically about their actions. Players need to manage essential resources like food, water, and medical supplies to keep their character alive and at their peak performance.
The mechanics are realistic: players must search for resources, hunt animals, gather plants, or scavenge abandoned buildings to find what they need.

  Phishing: A Deceptive Cyberattack Technique
Phishing is a cyberattack technique in which an attacker uses fraudulent emails, text messages, phone calls, or websites to trick their target into revealing sensitive information. This stolen data can then be misused against the victim. Sensitive information may include social privacy details, personal information, and even banking credentials.Phishing attacks fall under the category of social engineering, where the attacker does not need to directly hack a server or system. Instead, they exploit human error, psychology, pressure tactics, and manipulation skills to deceive their targets.Here Is The Framework To Understand Even More Quickly!
  
  
  Why phishing is a major cyberthreat
Phishing is popular among cybercriminals and highly effective. According to IBM's Cost of a Data Breach report, phishing is the most common data breach vector, accounting for 15% of all breaches. Breaches caused by phishing cost organizations an average of USD 4.88 million.Phishing is a significant threat because it exploits people rather than technological vulnerabilities. Attackers don't need to breach systems directly or outsmart cybersecurity tools. They can trick people who have authorized access to their target—be it money, sensitive information or something else—into doing their dirty work.Phishers can be lone scammers or sophisticated criminal gangs. They can use phishing for many malicious ends, including identity theft, credit card fraud, monetary theft, extortion, account takeovers, espionage and more.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Evaluate your LLM!

The AI landscape is constantly evolving, with new models pushing the boundaries of what's possible. But one name has been making waves recently, i.e, . Unlike other AI tools, this powerhouse has rewritten the rulebook on efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and performance. If you haven't heard of it yet, here’s why it’s capturing global attention.What Is DeepSeek and Why Is It Gaining Popularity?In January 2025, DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, emerged as a major player in the AI space. Developed by a Chinese AI lab, it rapidly climbed the app store rankings, even surpassing ChatGPT as the most popular free AI assistant in the US.
But what’s driving the hype? DeepSeek-R1 isn’t just another AI model—it’s an example of cutting-edge efficiency at a fraction of the usual cost. Unlike its competitors, which require massive investments,  was trained for just —a game-changing breakthrough in AI development.Innovation Behind DeepSeekDeepSeek’s strength lies in its  training method, which splits its AI into specialized sub-models. Instead of a single large neural network handling everything, each part of DeepSeek is optimized for specific tasks, making it both  and more .
Another key advantage is its , which adjusts processing power based on task complexity. This means DeepSeek can deliver high performance while using significantly fewer resources compared to other models.Moreover, instead of relying on Nvidia’s high-end H100 chips, DeepSeek utilizes the more affordable , making AI training and deployment  cheaper than models like DeepSeek-R1 helping open-source communityDeepSeek released its flagship model, DeepSeek-R1, under the . This model, developed with remarkable resource efficiency—using approximately 2,000 Nvidia H800 GPUs over 55 days demonstrated performance on par with leading AI models from established tech giants. DeepSeek has made significant strides in the artificial intelligence landscape by open-sourcing its advanced AI models. 
The open-source release of DeepSeek-R1 has lowered barriers to AI development, fostering innovation and competition across the global AI community. The company has also released models like , designed to enhance code intelligence, and , aimed at advancing vision-language understanding. These models are available for public use and modification, promoting transparency and collaboration in AI research and application.How DeepSeek Outperforms Other AI ModelsBeyond its efficiency, DeepSeek is redefining AI reliability with its R1 Reasoning Model. Unlike traditional models, the probability of the R1 Reasoning Model giving appealing outputs is much higher as compared to other available models since this model is designed to validate its own reasoning supporting its output, improving accuracy in subjects like math, science, and fact-checking.
This makes DeepSeek particularly powerful for research, problem-solving, and advanced computations, offering a level of precision that many AI models like  from OpenAI,  from MetaAI, and  from Google, etc struggle to achieve.Challenges and LimitationsDespite its impressive capabilities, DeepSeek isn’t without challenges. Its business model remains uncertain, as it offers services at a significantly lower cost than competitors, raising questions about long-term sustainability. If integrated into government or corporate infrastructure, DeepSeek AI could be exploited for surveillance by foreign adversaries, affecting nation's cybersecurity. Although being open-source, certain components of the model (e.g., training datasets and fine-tuned versions) might be controlled by external entities, leading to potential data leaks.
Additionally, being developed in China, DeepSeek follows strict content regulations. Topics such as Taiwan’s political status or the Tiananmen Square incident are restricted due to Chinese internet policies, which may affect its global adaptability.What’s Next for DeepSeek and AI?DeepSeek’s rise proves that bigger isn’t always better. With its cost-effective approach, rapid deployment, and self-reasoning abilities, it’s challenging industry giants and setting a new standard for AI development.

In this guide, I’ll walk you through getting started with AWS Bedrock and invoking the Amazon Titan Text Lite v1 model for text generation.
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:AWS Account with access to Amazon Bedrock(For testing will be using AmazonBedrockFullAccess)AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate permissionsBoto3 (AWS SDK for Python) installed on your machineYou can install Boto3 using:Step 1: Set Up AWS CredentialsIf you haven’t already configured your AWS credentials, run:Enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Key, and select your preferred region where Amazon Bedrock is available (e.g., us-east-1).Step 2: Initialize the Bedrock Client
To interact with Amazon Bedrock, we need to initialise the AWS Bedrock runtime client using Boto3:# Initialize Bedrock client
bedrock = boto3.client("bedrock-runtime", region_name="us-east-1")
Step 3: Invoke Amazon Titan Text Lite v
Let’s create a simple script to invoke Amazon Titan Text Lite v1 for generating a text response.# Define the input text
question = "What is the capital of India?"

# Prepare the payload
payload = {
    "inputText": question,
    "textGenerationConfig": {
        "maxTokenCount": 100,
        "temperature": 0.5,
        "topP": 0.9
    }
}

# Invoke Titan Text Lite v1
response = bedrock.invoke_model(
    modelId="amazon.titan-text-lite-v1",
    contentType="application/json",
    accept="application/json",
    body=json.dumps(payload)
)

# Parse response
result = json.loads(response["body"].read().decode("utf-8"))

# Extract and print the output text
if "results" in result and isinstance(result["results"], list):
    print("Answer:", result["results"][0]["outputText"].strip())
else:
    print("Unexpected response format:", result)
Step 4: Running the ScriptSave the script as invoke_bedrock.py and run it using:Expected Output:Answer: New Delhi is the capital of India. It is situated in the countrys federal district, which is known as the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT), and is located in the Indian subcontinent.Step 5: Fine-tuning Model ParametersAmazon Titan models allow temperature and topP tuning for response variation:temperature: Controls randomness (Lower = More deterministic, Higher = More creative)topP: Controls sampling probability (Higher = More diverse responses)
Adjust these values in the textGenerationConfig section for different results.Conclusion
You have successfully invoked the Amazon Titan Text Lite v1 model using AWS Bedrock! You can now integrate this into your applications for chatbots, summarization, and content generation.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>🚀 New eBook: The Developer’s Guide to UX Design Thinking – Future-Proof Your Career</title><link>https://dev.to/ricky_creates/new-ebook-the-developers-guide-to-ux-design-thinking-future-proof-your-career-3m6k</link><author>Ricky Synnot</author><category>ai</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 11:00:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

The setup described in the contract materials notes that it will include a substantial memory upgrade from Nvidia.Though small compared to the massive AI-training data centers deployed by companies like OpenAI and Meta, the SuperPod is still a powerful and expensive setup using the most advanced technology offered by Nvidia, whose chips have facilitated the global machine-learning spree. While the hardware can be used in many ways, it’s marketed as a turnkey means of creating and querying an AI model. Last year, the MITRE Corporation, a federally funded military R&D lab, acquired a $20 million SuperPod setup to train bespoke AI models for use by government agencies, touting the purchase as a “massive increase in computing power” for the United States.How exactly the IRS will use its SuperPod is unclear. An agency spokesperson said the IRS had no information to share on the supercomputer purchase, including which presidential administration ordered it. A 2024 report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration identified 68 different AI-related projects underway at the IRS; the Nvidia cluster is not named among them, though many were redacted.But some clues can be gleaned from the purchase materials. “The IRS requires a robust and scalable infrastructure that can handle complex machine learning (ML) workloads,” the document explains. “The Nvidia Super Pod is a critical component of this infrastructure, providing the necessary compute power, storage, and networking capabilities to support the development and deployment of large-scale ML models.”The document notes that the SuperPod will be run by the IRS Research, Applied Analytics, and Statistics division, or RAAS, which leads a variety of data-centric initiatives at the agency. While no specific uses are cited, it states that this division’s Compliance Data Warehouse project, which is behind this SuperPod purchase, has previously used machine learning for automated fraud detection, identity theft prevention, and generally gaining a “deeper understanding of the mechanisms that drive taxpayer behavior.”“The IRS has probably more proprietary data than most agencies that is totally untapped.”It’s unclear from the document whether the SuperPod purchase had been planned under the Biden administration or if it represents a new initiative of the Trump administration.Some funding from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act was earmarked for upgrading IRS technology generally, said Travis Thompson, a tax attorney with Boutin Jones with an expertise in IRS AI strategy. But “the IRS has been going toward AI for quite some time prior to IRA funding,” Thompson explained. “They didn’t have enough money to properly enforce the tax code, they were looking for ways to do more with less.” A June 2024 Government Accountability Office report suggested the IRS use artificial intelligence-based software to retrieve “hundreds of billions of dollars [that] are potentially missing from what should be collected in taxes each year.”Thompson added that the agency is ripe for machine-learning training because of the mountain of personal and financial data it sits atop. “The IRS has probably more proprietary data than most agencies that is totally untapped. When you look at something like this Nvidia cluster and training machine learning algorithms going forward, it makes perfect sense, because they have the data there. AI needs data. It needs lots of it. And it needs it quickly. And the IRS has it.”The purchase comes at a crossroads for U.S. governance of artificial intelligence tech. In Trump’s first term, the RAAS office was assigned “responsibility for monitoring and overseeing AI at the IRS” under Executive Order 13960, which he signed shortly before leaving office in 2020. This executive order put an emphasis on the “responsible,” “safe” implementation of AI by the United States — an approach that has fallen out of favor by American tech barons who now advocate for the breakneck development of these technologies unburdened by consideration of ethics or risk. One of Trump’s first moves following his inauguration was reversing a Biden administration executive order calling for greater AI safety guardrails in government use.Many of the AI industry for whom “safe AI” is now anathema have become close allies of the new Trump White House, such as Elon Musk and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen. This wing of Silicon Valley has reportedly pushed the new administration to leverage artificial intelligence to help dismantle the administrative state via automation.This week, the Wall Street Journal reported Musk’s liquidators had arrived at the IRS, an agency long the target of disparagement and distortion by Trump and Republican allies. Days before, the New York Times reported, “Representatives from the so-called Department of Government Efficiency have sought information about the tax collector’s information technology, with a goal of automating more work to replace the need for human staff members.”The IRS has in recent years increasingly turned to AI for automated fraud detection and chatbot-based support services — including through collaboration with Nvidia — but a new Nvidia supercomputer could also be a boon to those interested in shrinking the agency’s human headcount as much as possible. A February 8 report by the Washington Post quoted an unnamed federal official who described Musk’s end goal as “replacing the human workforce with machines,” and that “Everything that can be machine-automated will be. And the technocrats will replace the bureaucrats.”Musk underlings are reportedly contemplating replacing humans at the Department of Education with a large language-based chatbot, as well.Wired previously reported that Musk loyalist Thomas Shedd, placed in a directorship within the General Services Administration, has talked of an “AI-first” agenda for Trump’s second term; DOGE staffers have already reportedly turned to Microsoft’s Azure AI platform for advice on slashing programs. While the Nvidia SuperPod couldn’t on its own replicate services like those provided by Microsoft, it is powerful enough to train AI models based on government data.Thompson told The Intercept that efforts to slash the federal workforce and more aggressively deploy artificial intelligence systems fit hand-in-glove.“I firmly believe that rooted behind the reduction in the human workforce that seems to be goal of current administration, there’s an overarching goal there to implement more technology-based systems in order to do the jobs,” he explained. “If you’re going to reduce your workforce, something has to pick up the slack. Something has to do the job.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>5 Websites to Help You Stand Out on Social Media</title><link>https://dev.to/jsam/5-websites-to-help-you-stand-out-on-social-media-59i3</link><author>jsam</author><category>ai</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 08:27:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://dev.to/t/ai">Dev.to AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In today's digital age, social media has become an integral part of our lives.

The term "malware" is derived from two words: "mal," meaning malicious, and "ware," meaning software, forming the word "malware."Typically, malware is created by illegal hackers, commonly known as black hat hackers. These programs are highly capable and can cause severe damage to both organizations and individuals. Once installed on a device, malware exploits it by accessing messages, call logs, browser history, and even bank balances or other sensitive information.Once again, malware consists of illegal software used by black hat hackers and crackers. There are various types of malware, mainly viruses, spyware, trojans, ransomware, keyloggers, and worms. In this discussion, we will explore them in detail.Here are some common types of malwares that can destroy your pc
Viruses are malicious programs specifically designed to attach themselves to files or documents and execute when the infected file is opened. As a result, they can harm your system, slow down performance, and even steal sensitive information.
Spyware is a malicious piece of code created to collect information from a system and spy on it without the user's knowledge or consent. This includes passwords, social information, and even bank details. Spyware is commonly found in unauthorized third-party applications.
A Trojan is a malicious piece of code that appears to be legitimate software. However, once mistakenly installed by a user, it operates in the background and gains system access to perform malicious activities. Trojans are often embedded in third-party apps, games, documents, software patches, and even emails.
Ransomware is one of the most powerful and dangerous types of malware. It encrypts a target’s data and demands a ransom payment in exchange for decryption. Once a system is infected, recovering the data without paying the ransom is nearly impossible (at least for now).
A keylogger is a malicious program specifically designed to capture a user's keystrokes in real-time. This means anything you type on your keyboard can be recorded, including personal details and sensitive social media credentials.To protect yourself from malware, follow these preventive measures:Remember, nothing is 100% secure! Always stay cautious.
Choose a robust antivirus program like Avast, Norton, AVG, or Kaspersky.Regularly back up your data to avoid losing important files.Avoid installing third-party software whenever possible.Scan files before use with VirusTotal if you must use third-party software (not recommended).Stay away from cracked software, as it is often infected with malware.Never download unauthorized files from the internet, as they may contain hidden threats.Use a secure and updated browser, such as Tor, Firefox, Edge, or Opera.Keep your operating system updated to protect against vulnerabilities.Stay informed and educate others about cyber threats to enhance digital security.In this discussion, we explored what malware is and how destructive it can be. This was just a glimpse—there are many other types of malware that were not included here. However, these are some of the most common and stable malware threats.Always try to use authentic software, files, and systems, and educate others about cyber threats. Stay up to date with the latest security practices because no one is ever 100% safe online.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[R] A Survey of Logical Reasoning Capabilities in Large Language Models: Frameworks, Methods, and Evaluation</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1iqmjal/r_a_survey_of_logical_reasoning_capabilities_in/</link><author>/u/Successful-Western27</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 06:55:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - ML</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This new survey provides a comprehensive analysis of logical reasoning capabilities in LLMs, examining different reasoning types, evaluation methods, and current limitations.Key technical aspects: - Categorizes logical reasoning into deductive, inductive, and abductive frameworks - Evaluates performance across multiple benchmarks and testing methodologies - Analyzes the relationship between model size and reasoning capability - Reviews techniques for improving logical reasoning, including prompt engineering and chain-of-thought methodsMain findings: - LLMs show strong performance on basic logical tasks but struggle with complex multi-step reasoning - Model size alone doesn't determine reasoning ability - training methods and problem-solving strategies play crucial roles - Current evaluation methods may not effectively distinguish between true reasoning and pattern matching - Performance degrades significantly when problems require combining multiple reasoning typesI think the most important contribution here is the systematic breakdown of where current models succeed and fail at logical reasoning. This helps identify specific areas where we need to focus research efforts, rather than treating reasoning as a monolithic capability.I think this work highlights the need for better benchmarks - many current tests don't effectively measure true reasoning ability. The field needs more robust evaluation methods that can differentiate between memorization and actual logical inference.TLDR: Comprehensive survey of logical reasoning in LLMs showing strong basic capabilities but significant limitations in complex reasoning.

Users can export final reports as PDFs or share them via Perplexity Pages.The service launches first on web browsers, with iOS, Android, and Mac versions planned for later release. While basic access is free, daily query limits apply to non-subscribers. Perplexity says the tool works particularly well for finance, marketing, and technology research.Deepseek enables cheaper Deep ResearchPerplexity's Deepseek version of Deep Research scored 20.5 percent accuracy in "Humanity's Last Exam", a comprehensive AI benchmark with over 3,000 questions, placing it just behind OpenAI's Deep Research based on o3.Perplexity measures its own service with Internet knowledge against other models that only answer the questions with trained knowledge, and accordingly achieves significantly better results. For a company whose product has been criticized for being less than truthful, advertising that is less than truthful is not a confidence-building measure.Checking the AI's wall of textLike all so-called "answer engines" - with or without Deep Research - Perplexity generates falsehoods and inaccuracies in its reports. It is up to humans to verify and validate these results.The challenge is that these errors can be very subtle and hidden in large amounts of text, as in this example: Here LLM critic Gary Marcus is credited with a paper that refers to LLMs as "stochastic parrots". This is certainly in line with Marcus' beliefs, and he may have used the term before. But he did not write the paper.Perplexity does not respond to regular inquiries about whether error rates in AI responses are systematically studied and how high they are. Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI do not answer this question either.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[D] Self-Promotion Thread</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1iqiy4x/d_selfpromotion_thread/</link><author>/u/AutoModerator</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 03:15:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - ML</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Please post your personal projects, startups, product placements, collaboration needs, blogs etc.Please mention the payment and pricing requirements for products and services.Please do not post link shorteners, link aggregator websites , or auto-subscribe links.Any abuse of trust will lead to bans.Encourage others who create new posts for questions to post here instead!Thread will stay alive until next one so keep posting after the date in the title.Meta: This is an experiment.

I work at a company that strictly adheres to mathematical, explainable models. Their stance is that methods like Neural Networks or even Gradient Boosting Machines are too "black-box" and thus unreliable for decision-making. While I understand the importance of interpretability (especially in mission critical scenarios) I can't help but feel that this approach is overly restrictive. I see a lot of research and industry adoption of these methods, which makes me wonder: are they really just black boxes, or is this an outdated view? Surely, with so many people working in this field, there must be ways to gain insights into these models and make them more trustworthy. Am I also missing out on them, since I do not have work experience with such models?EDIT: Context is formula one! However, races are a thing and support tools another. I too would avoid such models in anything strictly related to a race, unless completely necessary.

These models, and the companies behind them, exploit human artists, using their work without permission or payment to build commercial AI products that compete with them.”Calling on Christie’s to cancel the auction, which starts on 20 February, it adds: “Your support of these models, and the people who use them, rewards and further incentivizes AI companies’ mass theft of human artists’ work.”The use of copyrighted work to train AI models – the technology that underpins chatbots and image generation tools such as Stable Diffusion and Midjourney – has become a battleground between creatives and tech companies, with artists, authors, publishers and music labels launching a series of lawsuits alleging breach of copyright.The British composer Ed Newton-Rex, a key figure in the campaign by creative professionals for protection of their work and a signatory to the letter, said at least nine of the works appearing in the auction appeared to have used models trained on artists’ work. However, other pieces in the auction do not appear to have used such models.A spokesperson for Christie’s said that “in most cases” the AI used to create art in the auction had been trained on the artists’ “own inputs”.“The artists represented in this sale all have strong, existing multidisciplinary art practices, some recognised in leading museum collections. The works in this auction are using artificial intelligence to enhance their bodies of work and in most cases AI is being employed in a controlled manner, with data trained on the artists’ own inputs,” said the spokesperson.A British artist whose work features in the auction, Mat Dryhurst, said he cared about the issue of art and AI “deeply” and rejected the criticisms in the letter. A piece by Dryhurst and his wife, Holly Herndon – based on a work called xhairymutantx – is on sale at the auction with an estimated price of between $70,000 and $90,000.“This is of interest to us and we have made a lot of art exploring and attempting to intervene in this process as is well within our rights.”He added: “It is not illegal to use any model to create artwork. I resent that an important debate that should be focused on companies and state policy is being focused on artists grappling with the technology of our time.”Anadol also rejected the criticism. In a post on X, he said the backlash was a consequence of “lazy critic practices and doomsday hysteria”.Anadol told the Guardian the piece being auctioned, ISS Dreams, was created using AI technology that had been trained on publicly available datasets from NASA “that have been used widely by artists for many decades.”He added that “the suggestion that this artwork was created using ‘AI models that are known to be on copyrighted work trained without a license’ is factually incorrect.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Lil guy is trying his best</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1iq6dyy/lil_guy_is_trying_his_best/</link><author>/u/MetaKnowing</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 17:27:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[D] Have any LLM papers predicted a token in the middle rather than the next token?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1iq4f0r/d_have_any_llm_papers_predicted_a_token_in_the/</link><author>/u/TheWittyScreenName</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 15:59:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - ML</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I’m working on a project (unrelated to NLP) where we use essentially the same architecture and training as GPT-3, but we’re more interested in finding a series of tokens to connect a starting and ending “word” than the next “word”.

We need to unify all the national dataIf governments want in, they’ll need to gather all their data – spatial information, economic data, electronic healthcare records including genomic data, and info about infrastructure. Whatever they’ve got, basically. And put it all in one place to be analyzed by algorithms. The American multi-billionaire used the United States as an example, if not a goal."I have to tell [the] AI model as much about my country as I can," Ellison said. "We need to unify all the national data, put it into a database where it's easily consumable by the AI model, and then ask whatever question you like," he said. "That's the missing link."He believes the payoff will include better healthcare, thanks to treatments tailored to individuals, and the ability for governments to lift food production by better predicting crop yields. Analyzing land so that farmers can be advised where to apply fertilizers or increase irrigation was another scenario Ellison floated."As long as countries will put their data - all of it - in a single place we can use AI to help manage the care of all of the patients and the population at large," Ellison said, adding his belief that AI can handle other social services and eliminate fraud.Of course, such a vast database system could also be the precursor to pervasive surveillance – an idea Ellison last year said he feels is desirable and would like Oracle to help facilitate.Constant real-time surveillance of populations, analyzed by Oracle-powered machine-learning products, would keep everyone "on their best behavior," Ellison said at an Oracle financial analyst conference in September 2024. We're reminded of the NSA, PRISM, Snowden.Ellison is not just a techno-optimist. He’s also a top executive and shareholder who has made big AI investments as well as a database company to feed.He therefore told the Dubai audience that Oracle, already a big-time government and military contractor, is ready to help nations realize his above-mentioned AI visions. Ie: Put all this data into one big expensive Oracle system to learn from and process."Oracle is building a 2.2GW datacenter that costs between $50 and $100 billion dollars to build," Ellison said, noting it's sites like that where super-powered AI models will be trained. "Because these models are so expensive, you won't build your own as a rule. There'll be a handful of these models."And a handful of players that can train them. Oracle’s own facilities will likely be one. The super-corp has also joined another, the Stargate project, that plans to blow $500 billion on AI infrastructure in the US in the next four years. ®]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Altman: OpenAI not for sale, especially to competitor who is not able to beat us</title><link>https://www.axios.com/2025/02/11/openai-altman-musk-offer</link><author>/u/namanyayg</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 14:17:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=3">Reddit - AI</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Will AI Lead to the Disintermediation of Knowledge?</title><link>https://www.datasciencecentral.com/will-ai-lead-to-the-disintermediation-of-knowledge/</link><author>Bill Schmarzo</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 13:28:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.datasciencecentral.com/">Data Science Central</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Key Blog Points: For decades, organizations have operated under the central assumption that knowledge flows downward.

I am fortunate enough to work and develop with these technologies every day as a machine learning engineer!In this article, I will walk you through my journey to becoming a machine learning engineer, shedding some light and advice on how you can become one yourself!In one of my previous articles, I extensively wrote about my journey from school to securing my first Data Science job. I recommend you check out that article, but I will summarise the key timeline here.Pretty much everyone in my family studied some sort of STEM subject. My great-grandad was an engineer, both my grandparents studied physics, and my mum is a maths teacher.So, my path was always paved for me.I chose to study physics at university after watching The Big Bang Theory at age 12; it’s fair to say everyone was very proud!At school, I wasn’t dumb by any means. I was actually relatively bright, but I didn’t fully apply myself. I got decent grades, but definitely not what I was fully capable of.I was very arrogant and thought I would do well with zero work.I applied to top universities like Oxford and Imperial College, but given my work ethic, I was delusional thinking I had a chance. On results day, I ended up in clearing as I missed my offers. This was probably one of the saddest days of my life.Clearing in the UK is where universities offer places to students on certain courses where they have space. It’s mainly for students who don’t have a university offer.I was lucky enough to be offered a chance to study physics at the University of Surrey, and I went on to earn a first-class master’s degree in physics!There is genuinely no substitute for hard work. It is a cringy cliche, but it is true!My original plan was to do a PhD and be a full-time researcher or professor, but during my degree, I did a research year, and I just felt a career in research was not for me. Everything moved so slowly, and it didn’t seem there was much opportunity in the space.During this time, DeepMind released theirdocumentary on YouTube, which popped up on my home feed.From the video, I started to understand how AI worked and learn about neural networks, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. To be honest, to this day I am still not an expert in these areas.Naturally, I dug deeper and found that a data scientist uses AI and machine learning algorithms to solve problems. I immediately wanted in and started applying for data science graduate roles.I spent countless hours coding, taking courses, and working on projects. I applied to and eventually landed my first data science graduate scheme in September 2021.You can hear more about my journey from a podcast.I started my career in an insurance company, where I built various supervised learning models, mainly using gradient boosted tree packages like CatBoost, XGBoost, and generalised linear models (GLMs).I built models to predict: — Did someone fraudulently make a claim to profit.— What’s the premium we should give someone.— How many claims will someone have. — What’s the average claim value someone will have.I made around six models spanning the regression and classification space. I learned so much here, especially in statistics, as I worked very closely with Actuaries, so my maths knowledge was excellent.However, due to the company’s structure and setup, it was difficult for my models to advance past the PoC stage, so I felt I lacked the “tech” side of my toolkit and understanding of how companies use machine learning in production.After a year, my previous employer reached out to me asking if I wanted to apply to a junior data scientist role that specialises in time series forecasting and optimisation problems. I really liked the company, and after a few interviews, I was offered the job!I worked at this company for about 2.5 years, where I became an expert in forecasting and combinatorial optimisation problems.I developed many algorithms and deployed my models to production through AWS using software engineering best practices, such as unit testing, lower environment, shadow system, CI/CD pipelines, and much more.Fair to say I learned a lot. I worked very closely with software engineers, so I picked up a lot of engineering knowledge and continued self-studying machine learning and statistics on the side.Over time, I realised the actual value of data science is using it to make live decisions. There is a good quote by Pau Labarta BajoML models inside Jupyter notebooks have a business value of $0There is no point in building a really complex and sophisticated model if it will not produce results. Seeking out that extra 0.1% accuracy by staking multiple models is often not worth it.You are better off building something simple that you can deploy, and that will bring real financial benefit to the company.With this in mind, I started thinking about the future of data science. In my head, there are two avenues: -> You work primarily to gain insight into what the business should be doing and what it should be looking into to boost its performance. -> You ship solutions (models, decision algorithms, etc.) that bring business value.I feel the data scientist who analyses and builds PoC models will become extinct in the next few years because, as we said above, they don’t provide tangible value to a business.That’s not to say they are entirely useless; you have to think of it from the business perspective of their return on investment. Ideally, the value you bring in should be more than your salary.You want to say that you did “X that produced Y”, which the above two avenues allow you to do.The engineering side was the most interesting and enjoyable for me. I genuinely enjoy coding and building stuff that benefits people, and that they can use, so naturally, that’s where I gravitated towards.To move to the ML engineering side, I asked my line manager if I could deploy the algorithms and ML models I was building myself. I would get help from software engineers, but I would write all the production code, do my own system design, and set up the deployment process independently.And that’s exactly what I did.Coincidentally, my current employer contacted me around this time and asked if I wanted to apply for a machine learning engineer role that specialises in general ML and optimisation at their company!Call it luck, but clearly, the universe was telling me something. After several interview rounds, I was offered the role, and I am now a fully fledged machine learning engineer!Fortunately, a role kind of “fell to me,” but I created my own luck through up-skilling and documenting my learning. That is why I always tell people to show their work — you don’t know what may come from it.I want to share the main bits of advice that helped me transition from a machine learning engineer to a data scientist. — A machine learning engineer is  an entry-level position in my opinion. You need to be well-versed in data science, machine learning, software engineering, etc. You don’t need to be an expert in all of them, but have good fundamentals across the board. That’s why I recommend having a couple of years of experience as either a software engineer or data scientist and self-study other areas. — If you are from data science, you must learn to write good, well-tested production code. You must know things like typing, linting, unit tests, formatting, mocking and CI/CD. It’s not too difficult, but it just requires some practice. I recommend asking your current company to work with software engineers to gain this knowledge, it worked for me! — Most companies nowadays deploy many of their architecture and systems on the cloud, and machine learning models are no exception. So, it’s best to get practice with these tools and understand how they enable models to go live. I learned most of this on the job, to be honest, but there are courses you can take. — I am sure most of you know this already, but every tech professional should be proficient in the command line. You will use it extensively when deploying and writing production code. I have a basic guide you can checkout here.Data Structures & Algorithms — Understanding the fundamental algorithms in computer science are very useful for MLE roles. Mainly because you will likely be asked about it in interviews. It’s not too hard to learn compared to machine learning; it just takes time. Any course will do the trick. — Again, most tech professionals should know Git, but as an MLE, it is essential. How to squash commits, do code reviews, and write outstanding pull requests are musts. — Many MLE roles I saw required you to have some specialisation in a particular area. I specialise in time series forecasting, optimisation, and general ML based on my previous experience. This helps you stand out in the market, and most companies are looking for specialists nowadays.The main theme here is that I basically up-skilled my software engineering abilities. This makes sense as I already had all the math, stats, and machine learning knowledge from being a data scientist.If I were a software engineer, the transition would likely be the reverse. This is why securing a machine learning engineer role can be quite challenging, as it requires proficiency across a wide range of skills.Summary & Further ThoughtsI have a free newsletter, , where I share weekly tips and advice as a practising data scientist.

Instead of directly listing specific competencies to develop and the motivation behind mastering them, I will briefly outline the most important approaches, presenting them in chronological order as they have been developed and used over the past decades in machine learning.The reason is that I believe it is crucial to study these algorithms from the very beginning. In machine learning, many new methods are built upon older approaches, which is especially true for NLP and computer vision.For example, jumping directly into the implementation details of modern large language models (LLMs) without any preliminary knowledge may make it very difficult for beginners to grasp the motivation and underlying ideas of specific mechanisms.Given this, in the next two sections, I will highlight in  the key concepts that should be studied.Natural language processing (NLP) is a broad field that focuses on processing textual information. Machine learning algorithms cannot work directly with raw text, which is why text is usually preprocessed and converted into numerical vectors that are then fed into neural networks.Before being converted into vectors, words undergo , which includes simple techniques such as , stemming, lemmatization, normalization, or removing . After preprocessing, the resulting text is encoded into . Tokens represent the smallest textual elements in a collection of documents. Generally, a token can be a part of a word, a sequence of symbols, or an individual symbol. Ultimately, tokens are converted into numerical vectors.The  method is the most basic way to encode tokens, focusing on counting the frequency of tokens in each document. However, in practice, this is usually not sufficient, as it is also necessary to account for token importance — a concept introduced in the  and  methods. While TF-IDF improves upon the naive counting approach of bag of words, researchers have developed a completely new approach called embeddings. are numerical vectors whose components preserve the semantic meanings of words. Because of this, embeddings play a crucial role in NLP, enabling input data to be trained or used for model inference. Additionally, embeddings can be used to compare text similarity, allowing for the retrieval of the most relevant documents from a collection.Embeddings can also be used to encode other unstructured data, including images, audio, and videos.As a field, NLP has been evolving rapidly over the last 10–20 years to efficiently solve various text-related problems. Complex tasks like text translation and text generation were initially addressed using recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which introduced the concept of memory, allowing neural networks to capture and retain key contextual information in long documents.Although RNN performance gradually improved, it remained suboptimal for certain tasks. Moreover, RNNs are relatively slow, and their sequential prediction process does not allow for parallelization during training and inference, making them less efficient.Additionally, the original Transformer architecture can be decomposed into two separate modules:  and . Both of these form the foundation of the most state-of-the-art models used today to solve various NLP problems. Understanding their principles is valuable knowledge that will help learners advance further when studying or working with other large language models (LLMs).When it comes to LLMs, I strongly recommend studying the evolution of at least the first three GPT models, as they have had a significant impact on the AI world we know today. In particular, I would like to highlight the concepts of  and , introduced in GPT-2, which enable LLMs to solve text generation tasks without explicitly receiving any training examples for them.Another important technique developed in recent years is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The main limitation of LLMs is that they are only aware of the context used during their training. As a result, they lack knowledge of any information beyond their training data.The retriever converts the input prompt into an embedding, which is then used to query a vector database. The database returns the most relevant context based on the similarity to the embedding. This retrieved context is then combined with the original prompt and passed to a generative model. The model processes both the initial prompt and the additional context to generate a more informed and contextually accurate response.A good example of this limitation is the first version of the ChatGPT model, which was trained on data up to the year 2022 and had no knowledge of events that occurred from 2023 onward.To address this limitation, OpenAI researchers developed a RAG pipeline, which includes a constantly updated database containing new information from external sources. When ChatGPT is given a task that requires external knowledge, it queries the database to retrieve the most relevant context and integrates it into the final prompt sent to the machine learning model.The goal of distillation is to create a smaller model that can imitate a larger one. In practice, this means that if a large model makes a prediction, the smaller model is expected to produce a similar result.In the modern era, LLM development has led to models with millions or even billions of parameters. As a consequence, the overall size of these models may exceed the hardware limitations of standard computers or small portable devices, which come with many constraints.Quantization is the process of reducing the memory required to store numerical values representing a model’s weights.This is where optimization techniques become particularly useful, allowing LLMs to be compressed without significantly compromising their performance. The most commonly used techniques today include ,, and .Pruning refers to discarding the least important weights of a model.Regardless of the area in which you wish to specialize, knowledge of  is a must-have skill! Fine-tuning is a powerful concept that allows you to efficiently adapt a pre-trained model to a new task.Fine-tuning is especially useful when working with very large models. For example, imagine you want to use BERT to perform semantic analysis on a specific dataset. While BERT is trained on general data, it might not fully understand the context of your dataset. At the same time, training BERT from scratch for your specific task would require a massive amount of resources.Here is where fine-tuning comes in: it involves taking a pre-trained BERT (or another model) and freezing some of its layers (usually those at the beginning). As a result, BERT is retrained, but this time only on the new dataset provided. Since BERT updates only a subset of its weights and the new dataset is likely much smaller than the original one BERT was trained on, fine-tuning becomes a very efficient technique for adapting BERT’s rich knowledge to a specific domain.Fine-tuning is widely used not only in NLP but also across many other domains.As the name suggests,  involves analyzing images and videos using machine learning. The most common tasks include image classification, object detection, image segmentation, and generation.Most CV algorithms are based on neural networks, so it is essential to understand how they work in detail. In particular, CV uses a special type of network called convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These are similar to fully connected networks, except that they typically begin with a set of specialized mathematical operations called .In simple terms, convolutions act as filters, enabling the model to extract the most important features from an image, which are then passed to fully connected layers for further analysis.The next step is to study the most popular CNN architectures for classification tasks, such as AlexNet, VGG, Inception, ImageNet, and .Speaking of the object detection task, the  algorithm is a clear winner. It is not necessary to study all of the dozens of versions of YOLO. In reality, going through the original paper of the first YOLO should be sufficient to understand how a relatively difficult problem like object detection is elegantly transformed into both classification and regression problems. This approach in YOLO also provides a nice intuition on how more complex CV tasks can be reformulated in simpler terms.While there are many architectures for performing image segmentation, I would strongly recommend learning about , which introduces an encoder-decoder architecture.Finally, image generation is probably one of the most challenging tasks in CV. Personally, I consider it an optional topic for learners, as it involves many advanced concepts. Nevertheless, gaining a high-level intuition of how generative adversial networks (GAN) function to generate images is a good way to broaden one’s horizons.In some problems, the training data might not be enough to build a performant model. In such cases, the data augmentation technique is commonly used. It involves the artificial generation of training data from already existing data (images). By feeding the model more diverse data, it becomes capable of learning and recognizing more patterns.It would be very hard to present in detail the Roadmaps for all existing machine learning domains in a single article. That is why, in this section, I would like to briefly list and explain some of the other most popular areas in data science worth exploring.First of all, recommender systems (RecSys) have gained a lot of popularity in recent years. They are increasingly implemented in online shops, social networks, and streaming services. The key idea of most algorithms is to take a large initial matrix of all users and items and decompose it into a product of several matrices in a way that associates every user and every item with a high-dimensional embedding. This approach is very flexible, as it then allows different types of comparison operations on embeddings to find the most relevant items for a given user. Moreover, it is much more rapid to perform analysis on small matrices rather than the original, which usually tends to have huge dimensions. often goes hand in hand with RecSys. When a RecSys has identified a set of the most relevant items for the user, ranking algorithms are used to sort them to determine the order in which they will be shown or proposed to the user. A good example of their usage is search engines, which filter query results from top to bottom on a web page.Closely related to ranking, there is also a  problem that aims to optimally map objects from two sets, A and B, in a way that, on average, every object pair is mapped “well” according to a matching criterion. A use case example might include distributing a group of students to different university disciplines, where the number of spots in each class is limited. is an unsupervised machine learning task whose objective is to split a dataset into several regions (clusters), with each dataset object belonging to one of these clusters. The splitting criteria can vary depending on the task. Clustering is useful because it allows for grouping similar objects together. Moreover, further analysis can be applied to treat objects in each cluster separately.The goal of clustering is to group dataset objects (on the left) into several categories (on the right) based on their similarity. is another unsupervised problem, where the goal is to compress an input dataset. When the dimensionality of the dataset is large, it takes more time and resources for machine learning algorithms to analyze it. By identifying and removing noisy dataset features or those that do not provide much valuable information, the data analysis process becomes considerably easier. is an area that focuses on designing algorithms and data structures (indexes) to optimize searches in a large database of embeddings (vector database). More precisely, given an input embedding and a vector database, the goal is to  find the most similar embedding in the database relative to the input embedding.The goal of similarity search is to approximately find the most similar embedding in a vector database relative to a query embedding.The word “approximately” means that the search is not guaranteed to be 100% precise. Nevertheless, this is the main idea behind similarity search algorithms — sacrificing a bit of accuracy in exchange for significant gains in prediction speed or data compression. involves studying the behavior of a target variable over time. This problem can be solved using classical tabular algorithms. However, the presence of time introduces new factors that cannot be captured by standard algorithms. For instance:the target variable can have an overall , where in the long term its values increase or decrease (e.g., the average yearly temperature rising due to global warming).the target variable can have a  which makes its values change based on the currently given period (e.g. temperature is lower in winter and higher in summer).Most of the time series models take both of these factors into account. In general, time series models are mainly used a lot in financial, stock or demographic analysis.Another advanced area I would recommend exploring is , which fundamentally changes the algorithm design compared to classical machine learning. In simple terms, its goal is to train an agent in an environment to make optimal decisions based on a reward system (also known as the “trial and error approach”). By taking an action, the agent receives a reward, which helps it understand whether the chosen action had a positive or negative effect. After that, the agent slightly adjusts its strategy, and the entire cycle repeats.Reinforcement learning is particularly popular in complex environments where classical algorithms are not capable of solving a problem. Given the complexity of reinforcement learning algorithms and the computational resources they require, this area is not yet fully mature, but it has high potential to gain even more popularity in the future.Currently the most popular applications are:. Existing approaches can design optimal game strategies and outperform humans. The most well-known examples are chess and Go.. Advanced algorithms can be incorporated into robots to help them move, carry objects or complete routine tasks at home.. Reinforcement learning methods can be developed to automatically drive cars, control helicopters or drones.This article was a logical continuation of the previous part and expanded the skill set needed to become a data scientist. While most of the mentioned topics require time to master, they can add significant value to your portfolio. This is especially true for the NLP and CV domains, which are in high demand today.After reaching a high level of expertise in data science, it is still crucial to stay motivated and consistently push yourself to learn new topics and explore emerging algorithms.Data science is a constantly evolving field, and in the coming years, we might witness the development of new state-of-the-art approaches that we could not have imagined in the past.All images are by the author unless noted otherwise.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Publish Interactive Data Visualizations for Free with Python and Marimo</title><link>https://towardsdatascience.com/publish-interactive-data-visualizations-for-free-with-python-and-marimo/</link><author>Sam Minot</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://towardsdatascience.com/">Towards Data Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Working in Data Science, it can be hard to share insights from complex datasets using only static figures. All the facets that describe the shape and meaning of interesting data are not always captured in a handful of pre-generated figures. While we have powerful technologies available for presenting interactive figures — where a viewer can rotate, filter, zoom, and generally explore complex data  —  they always come with tradeoffs.Here I present my experience using a recently released Python library — marimo — which opens up exciting new opportunities for publishing interactive visualizations across the entire field of data science.Interactive Data VisualizationThe tradeoffs to consider when selecting an approach for presenting data visualizations can be broken into three categories: — what visualizations and interactivity am I able to present to the user? — what are the resources needed for displaying this visualization to users (e.g. running servers, hosting websites)? – how much of a new skillset / codebase do I need to learn upfront? is the foundation of portable interactivity. Every user has a web browser installed on their computer and there are many different frameworks available for displaying any degree of interactivity or visualization you might imagine (for example, this gallery of amazing things people have made with three.js). Since the application is running on the user’s computer, no costly servers are needed. However, a significant drawback for the data science community is ease of use, as JS does not have many of the high-level (i.e. easy-to-use) libraries that data scientists use for data manipulation, plotting, and interactivity. provides a useful point of comparison. Because of its continually growing popularity, some have called this the “Era of Python”. For data scientists in particular, Python stands alongside R as one of the foundational languages for quickly and effectively wielding complex data. While Python may be easier to use than Javascript, there are fewer options for presenting interactive visualizations. Some popular projects providing interactivity and visualization have been Flask, Dash, and Streamlit (also worth mentioning — bokeh, HoloViews, altair, and plotly). The biggest tradeoff for using Python has been the cost for publishing – delivering the tool to users. In the same way that shinyapps require a running computer to serve up the visualization, these Python-based frameworks have exclusively been server-based. This is by no means prohibitive for authors with a budget to spend, but it does limit the number of users who can take advantage of a particular project. is an intriguing middle ground — Python code running directly in the web browser using WebAssembly (WASM). There are resource limitations (only 1 thread and 2GB memory) that make this impractical for doing the heavy lifting of data science. , this can be more than sufficient for building visualizations and updating based on user input. Because it runs in the browser, no servers are required for hosting. Tools that use Pyodide as a foundation are interesting to explore because they give data scientists an opportunity to write Python code which runs directly on users’ computers without their having to install or run anything outside of the web browser.As an aside, I’ve been interested previously in one project that has tried this approach: stlite, an in-browser implementation of Streamlit that lets you deploy these flexible and powerful apps to a broad range of users. However, a core limitation is that Streamlit itself is distinct from stlite (the port of Streamlit to WASM), which means that not all features are supported and that advancement of the project is dependent on two separate groups working along compatible lines.The interface resembles a Jupyter , which will be familiar to users.Execution of cells is , so that updating one cell will rerun all cells which depend on its output. can be captured with a flexible set of UI components.Notebooks can be quickly converted into , hiding the code and showing only the input/output elements.Apps can be run locally or converted into using WASM/Pyodide.marimo balances the tradeoffs of technology in a way that is well suited to the skill set of the typical data scientists: — user input and visual display features are rather extensive, supporting user input via Altair and Plotly plots. — deploying as static webpages is basically free — no servers required — for users familiar with Python notebooks, marimo will feel very familiar and be easy to pick up.Publishing Marimo Apps on the WebAs a simple example of the type of display that can be useful in data science, consisting of explanatory text interspersed with interactive displays, I have created a barebones GitHub repository. Try it out yourself here.Using just a little bit of code, users can:Generate visualizations with flexible interactivityWrite narrative text describing their findingsPublish to the web for free (i.e. using GitHub Pages)Public App / Private DataThis new technology offers an exciting new opportunity for collaboration — publish the app publicly to the world, but users can only see specific datasets that they have permission to access.Rather than building a dedicated data backend for every app, user data can be stored in a generic backend which can be securely authenticated and accessed using a Python client library — all contained within the user’s web browser. For example, the user is given an OAuth login link that will authenticate them with the backend and allow the app to temporarily access input data.As a proof of concept, I built a simple visualization app which connects to the Cirro data platform, which is used at my institution to manage scientific data. Full disclosure: I was part of the team that built this platform before it spun out as an independent company. In this manner users can:Load the public visualization app — hosted on GitHub PagesConnect securely to their private data storeLoad the appropriate dataset for displayShare a link which will direct authorized collaborators to the same dataAs a data scientist, this approach of publishing free and open-source visualization apps which can be used to interact with private datasets is extremely exciting. Building and publishing a new app can take hours and days instead of weeks and years, letting researchers quickly share their insights with collaborators and then publish them to the wider world.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>5 Tips for Building a Data Science Portfolio</title><link>https://www.kdnuggets.com/5-tips-building-data-science-portfolio</link><author>Nate Rosidi</author><category>dev</category><category>ai</category><enclosure url="https://www.kdnuggets.com/wp-content/uploads/Rosidi_5_Tips_for_Building_a_DS_Portfolio_4.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 15:00:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.kdnuggets.com/">KDNuggets blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Not every data science portfolio is worth showcasing.

It is a symptom of how complex workflow orchestration has gotten. Is it a dominant trend or will we cycle back to “DAG specifications”? At Stitchfix, we had our own DSL that “compiled” into airflow DAGs and at MicroByre, we used a external workflow langauge. Both had a batch task executor on K8s but at MicroByre, we had human and robot in the loop workflows.// BioDr. Milowski is a serial entrepreneur and computer scientist with experience in a variety of data and machine learning technologies.
