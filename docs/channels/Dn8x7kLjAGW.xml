DESCRIPTION
Programming education has a critical blind spot: while we extensively teach code creation, we barely scratch the surface of testing and give almost no attention to debugging—despite debugging consuming half of all software development time.

In this conversation with Clare Sudbery, Prof. Andreas Zeller argues that systematic debugging skills and modern automated debugging tools are the "ugly stepchild" of programming that nobody wants to discuss, yet debugging represents the biggest business risk and time sink in software development. As AI-driven coding becomes more prevalent, this gap will only widen, making investment in proper debugging education and tools not just beneficial but essential for the future of software development.

ABSTRACT
This talk will cover how we created a system to generate health insurance appeals from denials. We'll start with a quick look at the different attempts at model fine-tuning (along with what eventually worked well for us), then look at the middleware, how we integrate in-house and external models, steps to protect privacy, and finally, some truly questionable frontend code (or truly great frontend code if we finish the rewrite in time—you never know).

If you love the American healthcare system as it stands today, this is probably not the talk for you. For those ambivalent about the healthcare system, that's totally fine; you can still see what it takes to bring an ML system from drinks at a bar all the way through to production. [...]

DESCRIPTION
When FundApps exploded from 20 to 50+ engineers in just one year, their old "everyone does support" model crumbled spectacularly. Software engineer Flavia Circiumaru and host Hannes Lowette dive deep into how this London-based regulatory compliance company transformed from a support-free-for-all to a streamlined powerhouse.

Flavia Circiumaru reveals the behind-the-scenes story of building a three-desk support system that turned their support team into the ultimate connector, bridging customers, developers, and business teams like never before. From battling context-switching nightmares to creating communication magic, Flavia and Hannes explore actionable insights on scaling support without losing your sanity.

The twist? Their ultimate goal is to make support so seamless that dedicated teams won't even be needed. Talk about engineering your way out of a job!

ABSTRACT
So, you’ve written a #DSL, it’s a work of art! It so perfectly models the problem at hand that even a trained house cat could generate business value. You just have one problem, your interpreter runs 100x slower than a shell script launching JVMs in a loop.

#DomainSpecificLanguages (DSLs) are able to offer the abstraction benefits of a high-level language, while when compiled, competing with low-level languages on performance. Because DSLs have a much smaller problem area, many specialised optimisations can be performed which are not feasible for a general purpose language.

In this talk, we will explain a number of optimisations which are useful for DSLs, and show our solutions to the practical issues we faced when implementing them in our #QueryLanguage, #Icicle.

Icicle is a query language for processing large amounts of time-series data. Its type system enforces that queries require only a single pass over the data, and that multiple queries over the same data can be fused together. By using a combination of high level optimisations such as partial evaluation and common subexpression elimination, and low level optimisations such as parsing code which is specialised for the given input, our queries are faster than the equivalent hand-written C code.

From this talk, the audience will learn how the focused point of view that DSLs provide can be useful in performance critical systems, as well as a number of concrete techniques for optimising their own DSLs.

ABSTRACT
The production of software is a complex, collaborative process that stretches our ability as human beings to cope with its demands. Many people working in #SoftwareDevelopment spend their careers without seeing what good really looks like.

Our history is littered with inefficient processes creating poor quality output, too late to capitalise on the expected business value.
How have we got into this state?
How do we get past it?
What does good really look like?

Continuous Delivery changes the economics of software development for some of the biggest companies in the world, whatever the nature of their software development, find out how and why.

ABSTRACT
This talk will demonstrate how AI, via transformers, can lift limits on core cognitive processes like attention, synthesis, and retention.

These insights will allow you to use AI more effectively to scaffold and accelerate your own learning.

After all, generative AI can do far more to propel our learning than simply answer questions (important and helpful though that may be!).

Generative AI is, in essence, a teacher—but it can teach better if you know how its properties are sometimes similar to, and sometimes very different from, how the human brain works. [...]

DESCRIPTION
Eduardo da Silva and Simon Rohrer discuss the core ideas of "Better Value Sooner Safer Happier" diving into the principles of organizational transformation.

Simon shares insights on the shift from output-driven to outcome-focused thinking, emphasizing value over productivity, and the need for continuous improvement in delivery speed, stakeholder satisfaction, and safety.
The conversation explores key concepts like technical excellence, integrating safety into development, and balancing incremental changes with occasional larger steps.
