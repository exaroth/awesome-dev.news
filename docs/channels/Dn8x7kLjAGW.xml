ABSTRACT
Whenever a new technology appears, our first instinct as developers is to offer "text" as the primary method of interaction. This has happened throughout computing history, with the computer terminal, with early smartphones, and now it's happening again with AI.

At tldraw, we’ve been working on moving AI interaction away from the chat-based interface, towards a richer canvas environment. It hasn't been easy! I'll show you all the challenges we've faced, and how we're currently overcoming them. Some of the solutions have been surprising. [...]

ABSTRACT
Are you a little spicy? If not, your colleague most probably is. Either way, this talk is for you.

In this session, Katrine will shine a light on neurodiversity and the transformative impact it can have on your life, your team, and your business.

Neurodiversity is not only abundantly prevalent in tech organizations; it is a powerful, often underutilized asset that manifests in every corner of our work environments. It is paramount that we adjust our understanding and strategies around this diversity to thrive. Katrine will explore how neurodiversity shows up in the most unexpected ways and why it’s both surprisingly easy and surprisingly challenging to harness its potential in team collaboration and leadership.

This talk will emphasize practical daily strategies to strengthen collaboration and leverage the advantages of neurodiversity in everyday work contexts, whether it’s adopting clear communication methods, allowing flexible work arrangements, or designing team workflows that play to diverse cognitive strengths.

I failed the next five interviews as well before finally landing my first job at .Since then, I’ve interviewed with many companies and faced my fair share of rejections. However, over the years, my failure rate in coding interviews dropped significantly.By 2022, with just 1.5 months of focused preparation, I successfully cleared interviews at  and .Surprisingly, my success wasn’t due to a dramatic improvement in problem-solving skills. The real game-changer was my approach— and  during the interview.In this article, I’ll share  that made coding interviews significantly easier for me.These tips cover everything you need to know, including:How to systematically approach coding interview problemsKey concepts and patterns you should knowThe type of problems you should practiceHow to choose the right algorithm for a given problemTechniques to optimize your solutionHow to communicate your thought process effectivelyBy applying these strategies, you’ll be able to tackle coding interviews with confidence and massively increase your chances of success.In a coding interview, interviewers want to see how well you , , and  under pressure.Here's a breakdown of what they look for:Understanding the problem: Do you ask clarifying questions instead of making assumptions to ensure you fully understand the problem?: Can you decompose the problem into smaller, manageable parts?: Can you design an optimal solution in terms of time and space complexity?: Do you handle edge cases like empty inputs, duplicates, large values, or special conditions?: Can you explain why one approach is better than another?: Do you have a strong grasp of data structures and algorithms, and can you choose the right one for the problem?Can you quickly compute the time and space complexity of your solution?Explaining your thought process: Can you clearly articulate your approach and why it works?: Are you receptive to hints and able to adjust your approach accordingly?: Do you follow good coding practices (meaningful variable names, proper indentation, modular functions etc..)?Improving the initial solution: Can you optimize and refine your first solution when prompted?Are you able to tackle variations of the original problem?Can you manually walk through your code with sample inputs to verify correctness?Most coding interviews last Depending on the company and interviewer, you may be asked to solve 2-3easy/medium problems or 1 hard problem with follow-ups.Lets assume you are given one problem, with a follow up in a 45-minute interview. Here’s how you can optimally allocate your time:The interviewer may ask you to introduce yourself. Prepare a concise 1-2 minute introduction that highlights your background, experience, and key strengths. Practice it beforehand so that you can deliver it smoothly.Understand the Problem (5-10 mins):  Carefully read the problem statement, ask clarifying questions, and walk through sample inputs and expected outputs.Plan the Approach (10-20 mins): Brainstorm possible solutions, evaluate trade-offs, and discuss time and space complexity.Implement the Code (20-30 mins): Write a clean, modular and readable code.Dry-run your code with sample inputs, debug any issues, and ensure edge cases are handled.Follow-ups and Wrap Up (35-45 mins): Answer follow up questions, and ask thoughtful questions to the interviewer about the company, role, or team.One of the biggest mistakes candidates make in coding interviews is jumping into coding too soon.If you don't fully understand the question, you might end up solving the Here’s how to ensure you grasp the problem before coding:Read the Problem CarefullyTake a moment to absorb the problem statement. Rephrase it in your own words to confirm your understanding. Identify the expected input/output format and any hidden constraints.If anything is unclear, ask questions before diving into the solution. Interviewers appreciate when you seek clarity. Never assume details that aren’t explicitly mentioned in the problem statement.Common clarifications include:Are there duplicate values?Can the input be empty? If so, what should the output be?Should the solution handle negative numbers?Should the output maintain the original order of elements?Is the graph directed or undirected?Does the input contain only lowercase English letters, or can it have uppercase, digits, or special characters?What should happen if multiple solutions exist? Should I return any valid solution, or does the problem have specific requirements?Walk Through Input/Output ExamplesOnce you understand the problem statement and constraints, go over a few input and output examples to make sure you get it.Draw them out if it helps, especially for visual data structures like trees or graphs.Try to take examples that cover different scenarios of the problem. Think about any  that might come up.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A new tool for visualizing Rust lifetimes</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV6Xo_el_2o</link><author>Let&apos;s Get Rusty</author><category>dev</category><category>rust</category><category>video</category><category>learning</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/NV6Xo_el_2o?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 15:00:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSp-OaMpsO8K0KkOqyBl7_w">Let&apos;s get Rusty</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[See how RustOwl can help you understand lifetimes in a real Rust codebase.

ABSTRACT
In this talk, we'll explore how Kafka serves as a powerful platform for capturing real-time streaming data and how organizations are increasingly adopting Apache Iceberg table format to store data in data lakes and data warehouses. We'll discuss the key benefits of using Apache Iceberg tables in your data lake such as schema evolution, ACID transactions, hidden partitioning, time traveling and efficient querying.

Next, we'll dive into how to efficiently stream data from Kafka into Iceberg-based data lakes. Confluent Tableflow will be introduced as a potential solution for streamlining the ingestion of Kafka streams into Iceberg tables within your data lake. A live demo will showcase the seamless integration of Kafka with Iceberg, equipping participants with practical knowledge to enhance their data architectures for powerful real-time analytics.

DESCRIPTION
Kent Beck and Daniel Terhorst-North reflect on the evolution of Extreme Programming (XP) and its lasting impact on agile software development. They explore the importance of short feedback loops, iterative learning, and adaptability in different phases of product development, as outlined in Beck’s 3X model (Exploration, Expansion, Extraction).

Kent introduces radical techniques like Test && Commit || Revert (TCR) and Limbo, which challenge traditional coding and collaboration practices by emphasizing tiny, safe iterations. The conversation ties in psychological safety, a key factor in high-performing teams, as outlined by Amy C. Edmondson.

Kent envisions a future where software development scales in real-time, pushing teams to embrace faster experimentation, responsibility, and continuous learning in a rapidly evolving tech landscape. [...]

The server retains some data from previous requests, making future interactions dependent on past state.In software systems,  refers to any data that persists across requests, such as user sessions, shopping carts, or authentication details.The choice between stateless and stateful architecture can affect scalability, performance, complexity, and cost.In this article, we’ll break down both the approaches, their advantages and trade-offs, and when to use each—with real-world examples.If you’re finding this newsletter valuable and want to deepen your learning, consider becoming a .As a paid subscriber, you'll receive an exclusive deep-dive article every week, access to a structured100+topics and interview questions, and other .In a , the system remembers client or process data () across multiple requests.Once a client connects, the server holds on to certain details—like user preferences, shopping cart contents, or authentication sessions—so the client doesn’t need to resend everything with each request.Stateful systems typically store the state data in a database or in-memory storage. During online shopping, when you add items to your cart, the website remembers your selections. If you navigate away to browse more items and then return to your cart, your items are still there, waiting for you to check out.Common Patterns in Stateful ArchitectureIf you use  session storage (i.e., each app server keeps its own sessions locally), you can configure your load balancer for “sticky sessions.” This means: Once a client is assigned to , all subsequent requests from that client are routed to .: If Server A fails, the user’s session data is lost or the user is forced to re-log in. Sticky sessions are also less flexible when scaling because you can’t seamlessly redistribute user traffic to other servers.2. Centralized Session StoreA more robust approach is to store session data in a  or  store (e.g., Redis). : All servers can access and update session data for any user. Any server can handle any request, because the session data is not tied to a specific server’s memory.: You introduce network overhead and rely on an external storage. If the centralized storage fails, you lose session data unless you have a fallback strategy.Personalized Experiences: Stateful systems can deliver highly tailored interactions, as they remember user preferences and past actions. Users can seamlessly resume activities where they left off, even if they disconnect and reconnect. Certain operations can be faster because the server already possesses necessary data. Maintaining state for a large number of users can become resource-intensive and complex, as each server needs to keep track of specific sessions. Managing and synchronizing state across multiple servers (if needed) introduces additional challenges. If a server holding a user's state fails, their session data might be lost.E-commerce Shopping Carts – Stores cart contents and user preferences across multiple interactions, even if the user navigates away and returns.Video Streaming Services (Netflix, YouTube) – Remembers user watch progress, recommendations, and session data for a seamless experience.Messaging Apps (WhatsApp, Slack) – Maintains active user sessions and message history for real-time communication.In a  architecture, the server does  preserve client-specific data between individual requests.Each request is treated as , with no memory of previous interactions.Every request must include all necessary information for processing.Once the server responds, it discards any temporary data used for that request.: Most  follow a stateless design. For instance, when you request weather data from a public API, you must provide all required details (e.g., location) in each request. The server processes it, sends a response, and forgets the interaction.Common Patterns in Stateless Architecture1. Token-Based Authentication (JWT)A very popular way to implement statelessness is through tokens, particularly  (JSON Web Tokens):Client Authenticates Once: The user logs in using credentials (username/password) for the first time, and the server issues a signed .: The client includes JWT token in each request (e.g., Authorization: Bearer <token> header).: The server validates the token’s signature and any embedded claims (e.g., user ID, expiry time).: The server does  need to store session data; it just verifies the token on each request.Many APIs, including OAuth-based authentication systems, use JWTs to enable stateless, scalable authentication.Stateless architectures benefit from , ensuring that repeated requests produce the same result. This prevents inconsistencies due to network retries or client errors. A  request with the same payload  updates the user’s data but doesn’t create duplicates.Idempotent APIsensures consistency and reliability, especially in distributed systems where requests might be retried automatically. Stateless systems are inherently easier to scale horizontally. New servers can be added effortlessly, as they don't need to maintain any specific user sessions. Since servers don't track state, the architecture is generally simpler and easier to manage. The failure of a single server won't disrupt user sessions, as data isn't tied to specific servers.With no session data stored on the server, you free up memory that would otherwise be reserved for session management.Easier to Cache Responses: Since requests are self-contained, caching layers (like CDNs) can more easily store and serve responses. Stateless systems can't provide the same level of personalization or context awareness as stateful systems without additional effort (like using cookies or tokens).The client must keep track of the authentication token or relevant data. If it loses the token, it must re-authenticate. Every request needs to carry all the required information, potentially leading to larger payloads.Microservices Architecture: Each service handles requests independently, relying on external databases or caches instead of maintaining session data.Public APIs (REST, GraphQL): Clients send tokens with each request, eliminating the need for server-side sessions.Tokens are securely stored on the device and sent with every request to authenticate users.Stateless endpoints make caching easier since responses depend only on request parameters, not stored session data. A CDNcan cache and serve repeated requests, improving performance and reducing backend load.There's no one-size-fits-all answer when choosing between stateful and stateless architectures.The best choice depends on your application’s needs, scalability goals, and user experience expectations.When to Choose Stateful ArchitectureStateful systems are ideal when user context and continuity are critical. Consider a stateful approach if your application:Requires personalization (e.g., user preferences, session history)Needs real-time interactions (e.g., chat applications, multiplayer gaming)Manages multi-step workflows (e.g., online banking transactions, checkout processes)Must retain authentication sessions for security and convenience A shopping cart in an e-commerce app should persist, so users don’t have to re-add items after refreshing the page.When to Choose Stateless ArchitectureStateless systems work best when scalability, simplicity, and resilience are top priorities. Use a stateless approach if your application:Handles a high volume of requests and needs to scale efficientlyDoesn’t require storing client-specific data between requestsNeeds fast, distributed processing without server dependenciesMust ensure reliability and failover readiness A weather API doesn’t need to remember previous requests. Each query includes the location, and the response is processed independently.Hybrid Approaches: The Best of Both WorldsMany modern applications  stateful and stateless components for flexibility.This hybrid approach allows:Stateless APIs for core functionality, ensuring high scalabilityStateful sessions for personalization, improving user experienceExternal session stores (e.g., Redis) to manage state while keeping app servers stateless A video streaming platform (e.g., Netflix) uses a stateless backend for streaming but retains stateful user sessions to track watch history and recommendations.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.
