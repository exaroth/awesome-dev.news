ABSTRACT
"I would have killed that if it was just me, 100%,” said Spotify founder and CEO Daniel Ek about Discover Weekly, a feature that would become one of Spotify’s most loved product features, almost a brand in itself.

Designers and senior engineers were equally skeptical, but the team was still able to ship the feature.

In this talk, you’ll learn how Spotify’s organisational culture of Agile management and autonomous teams enables innovation, using the Discover Weekly feature as an example. [...]

ABSTRACT
GitHub Copilot started life as code completion on steroids, but since its GA release in 2022, its capabilities have grown. GitHub Copilot now lives in more places than just your IDE. It's in your terminal, your browser, and in your pull requests. It can learn your entire codebase and help you understand it.

In this session, we'll look at what Copilot is, what it's become, and how it works. We'll run through the software engineering lifecycle from idea to production and highlight all the areas where tools like Copilot can save you time and effort. Finally, we'll talk about how GitHub Copilot was created, how it's being improved, and a little about the future of AI tooling. [...]

ABSTRACT
Inefficiency is ruining our planet and our lives. Efficiency is ruining our happiness, and weirdly, it’s also ruining our efficiency. Heeeeelppp!? What’s a techie to do? Zombie servers and slow code are a big climate problem, but the vrrrooom model gives us double-win hope. Holly walks through a range of techniques that can be used to find and eliminate software waste and reduce climate impacts.

But machine efficiency isn’t much use without human efficiency. Surprisingly, sorting out machine efficiency often helps humans, too. For example, the Quarkus Java framework uses many interesting waste-reduction techniques. These optimisations have the dual benefit of speeding up computers, and also speeding up people.

So far, so good, but we need to be careful we don’t end up accidentally optimising the wrong things, and making stuff worse. 100% utilisation is not sustainable for either humans, or people. It’s not even very efficient (what!?). Holly gives a brief tour of the brain’s default mode network, the latest business research, and queueing theory, to show why we actually achieve more when we do a bit less. [...]

These structures, combined with powerful  like , , and enable Redis to handle many use cases requiring  and .In this article, we will explore the Top 10 Use Cases of Redis with real-world examples and code implementation.Caching is the most common use case of Redis. Since web applications frequently rely on databases, querying a database on every request can be slow and inefficient, leading to high response times and increased server load. solves this problem by storing frequently accessed data in memory, significantly reducing latency and offloading queries from the database.There are multiple caching strategies (read through, cache aside, write back etc.,) each suited for different use cases.The  pattern is widely used because it gives the application full control over caching logic.When a client requests data, the application first checks Redis.If the data exists in Redis (), it is returned instantly.If data is not found (), it is fetched from the database, stored in Redis for future requests, and returned to the client.Code Example: Caching API ResponsesTo prevent stale or outdated data, Redis allows setting  (), ensuring automatic eviction of cached entries.Most modern web applications are , meaning they don’t store session information directly on the server. However, to keep users logged in, maintain shopping carts, or track user preferences, web applications need a reliable session management system.Since Redis is andprovide  options, it’s a great choice for storing session data.The application generates a unique session ID for the user.It stores session data in Redis, using the session ID as the key.The session ID is sent to the user's browser as a .The application retrieves the session ID from the user's cookie.It fetches user data from Redis using the session ID.If a user is inactive for too long, Redis automatically deletes the session after a set expiration time ().This prevents stale session accumulation, optimizing memory usage.Code Example: Storing and Retrieving SessionsSince Redis is an in-memory database, all session data is lost if the server restarts.Redis allows saving session data to disk using snapshots () or AOF logging.However, reloading session data after a crash may take too long, causing delays.Using Redis Replication for High Availability (Recommended for Production)Sessions are replicated to a backup Redis instance.If the primary Redis server fails, the backup is promoted to take over.This ensures minimal downtime for user sessions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GraphQL Federation - The @key to Your Platform API Strategy • Derek Kuc • GOTO 2024</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrA543HT3bA</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>video</category><category>learning</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/SrA543HT3bA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 13:00:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences yt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2024. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo

One reason why it might still fail is because it could be that you are dealing with a badly calibrated model. The predictions might be fine, but the probability estimates can be way off. 

In this video we talk about how to think about calibration and what it means.

However, this method is highly dependent on the number of servers, and any change in N can lead to , causing a major redistribution of keys (requests). addresses this issue by ensuring that only a small subset of keys need to be reassigned when nodes are added or removed.Popularized by , it has now become a fundamental technique in distributed databases like DynamoDB, Cassandra and ScyllaDB.In this article, we’ll explore what consistent hashing is, why it’s needed, how it works, and how to implement it in code.Meet  - a free adaptive AI IDE that transforms how you work, collaborating with you to run faster:Simply describe your project needs in natural language, and watch it build by TraeUpload your design files and let Trae assist in translating your visual concepts into clean, workable code.As you code, Trae learns your project patterns and provides contextually relevant suggestions to help you code more efficiently.Imagine you're building a high-traffic web application that serves millions of users daily. To handle the load efficiently, you distribute incoming requests across multiple backend servers using a .Your system consists of  (), and requests are assigned using a hash function that maps each user's IP address to a specific server.The process works like this:The load balancer takes a user’s IP address (or session ID).A  maps the IP to one of the backend servers by taking the sum of bytes in the IP address and computing  (since we have 5 servers).The request is routed to the assigned server, ensuring that the same user is always directed to the same server for session consistency.Everything Works Fine… Until You ScaleThis approach works as long as the number of servers remains constant. But what happens when you ?Scenario 1: Adding a New Server (S5)As traffic increases, you decide to  by adding a new backend server (). Now, the hash function must be modified to use  instead of since we have 6 servers now.This seemingly simple change completely disrupts the existing mapping, causing most users to be reassigned to different servers.This results into , leading to high overhead, and potential downtime.Scenario 2: Removing a Server (S4)Now, let’s say one of the servers () fails or is removed. The number of servers drops to 4, forcing the hash function to switch from  to .Even though only  server was removed, most users are reassigned to different servers. This can cause:Active users may be logged out or disconnected.Cached data becomes irrelevant, increasing database load.Severe performance degradation: The system may struggle to run efficiently.The Solution: Consistent Hashing offers a more scalable and efficient solution by ensuring that only a  are reassigned when scaling up or down.It performs really well when operated in dynamic environments, where the system scales up and down frequently.Consistent hashing is a distributed hashing technique used to efficiently distribute data across multiple nodes (servers, caches, etc.).It uses a  (hash ring) with a large and constant hash space.Both nodes (servers, caches, or databases) and keys (data items) are mapped to positions on this hash ring using a .Unlike modulo-based hashing, where changes in the number of nodes cause large-scale remapping, consistent hashing ensures that only a small fraction of keys are reassigned when a node is added or removed, making it highly scalable and efficient.In consistent hashing, when the number of nodes changes, only keys need to be reassigned, where  is the total number of keys and  is the total number of nodes.2.1 Constructing the Hash RingInstead of distributing keys based on , consistent hashing places both servers and keys on a circular hash ring.We use a large, fixed hash space ranging from  to  (assuming a 32-bit hash function).This creates a circular structure, where values wrap around after reaching the maximum limit.Placing Servers on the RingEach  is assigned a position on the hash ring by computing .Using the above example with , the hash function distributes them at different positions around the ring.When a key is added, its position is determined by computing .Example: a user’s request is assigned a position on the ring based on the hash of their IP address: We then move clockwise around the ring until we find the next available server.The key (or request) is assigned to this server for storage or retrieval. In case a key’s hash falls directly on a node’s position, it belongs to that node.Suppose we add a to the system.The position of  falls between  and  in the hash ring. takes over all keys (requests) that fall between  and , which were previously handled by .requests which were originally assigned to  will now be redirected to This demonstrates how consistent hashing efficiently redistributes keys with minimal disruption, ensuring that only a small subset of keys are reassigned when new servers are added.When a server, such as , fails or is removed from the system:All keys previously assigned to  are reassigned to the next available server in the ring ().Only the keys (requests) that were mapped to  need to move, while all other keys remain unaffected.This results in , unlike traditional hashing where removing a node would require reassigning most keys.In , each server is assigned  on the hash ring. However, this can lead to , especially when:The number of servers is small.Some servers accidentally get clustered together, creating .A server is , causing a sudden load shift to its immediate neighbor. are a technique used in consistent hashing to improve  and  by distributing data more evenly across servers.Instead of assigning one position per server, each physical server is assigned  (virtual nodes) on the hash ring.Each server is hashed multiple times to different locations on the ring.When a request (key) is hashed, it is assigned to the next virtual node in a clockwise direction.The request is then routed to the actual server associated with the virtual node.Assume we have three physical servers (S1, S2, S3). Without virtual nodes, their positions might be:S1 → Position 10
S2 → Position 50
S3 → Position 90If , all its keys must be reassigned to , which can create an overload.With , each server is hashed multiple times:S1-1 → Position 10
S1-2 → Position 70
S1-3 → Position 120
S2-1 → Position 50
S2-2 → Position 80
S2-3 → Position 160
S3-1 → Position 30
S3-2 → Position 90
S3-3 → Position 140Now, instead of just one point,  is represented at , making the distribution .If , its keys are more evenly redistributed among , rather than all going to .Stores hash values → server mappings.
