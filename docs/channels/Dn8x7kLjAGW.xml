ABSTRACT
Minimum viable product is one of the most misunderstood, misused, and abused terms in contemporary software development.
In this talk Jeff will explain the misunderstandings made by thought leaders that lead to confusion we all deal with today. You’ll learn the counter-intuitive concepts hidden in the term and why really using them is so hard. You’ll learn about techniques that will ultimately help you find smaller successful releases, test your ideas faster, develop higher quality software more predictably, and release more confidently than ever before. Because hidden in this nasty little term are clues that can help you do all that.

Jeff Patton helps companies adopt a way of working that’s focused on building great products, not just building stuff faster. Jeff blends a mixture of Agile thinking, Lean and Lean Startup Thinking, and UX Design and Design Thinking to end up with a holistic product-centric way of working. Jeff is author of the bestselling O’Reilly book User Story Mapping which describes a simple holistic approach to using stories in Agile development without losing sight of the big picture.

ABSTRACT
Web developers: AI offers a fantastic opportunity to make your web UIs genuinely more intelligent and productive than before. But don't just throw on a chatbot and call it done, as people may not even use it. Let's explore how language models can integrate into your existing web UIs, anticipating your users' needs and completing their tasks faster.

While this is a technical, demo-centric talk, it isn't about how LLMs or transformers work internally, nor just how to use Open AI SDKs from a particular language. Instead, it focuses on practical, end-to-end uses for AI in web apps, making your users happier and more productive. [...]

ABSTRACT
Rust is modern programming language that is only growing in popularity. It is often lauded for its approach to memory safety, particularly through making previously implicit concepts like data ownership explicit. On top of it comes a powerful reference validation system, the borrow checker.

However, Rust is often reduced to those two concepts. This talk will give an accessible overview to using Rust core principles - Ownership and Borrowing - together with other, lesser known concepts of the language to build safe and efficient APIs.

For Rust practicioners, this talk gives insight into known concepts in more detail. It does so by looking at examples from the Rust standard library first and foremost. For people who don't practice Rust regularly, it gives an insight into properties of the language that are less spoken about. [...]

DESCRIPTION
Liz and Lesley explore the evolution of platform engineering from its DevOps and SRE roots. They discuss the challenges of building effective developer platforms, the importance of psychological safety and evidence-based prioritization, the complexities of open source sustainability, and the delicate balance between centralized platform teams and developer autonomy.

The conversation covers practical insights on documentation automation, onboarding strategies, the manager-engineer career pendulum, and why treating platform work as a service rather than a mandate is crucial for organizational success.

If a system allows a maximum of , any request beyond that limit within the same minute would either be  or , often with an HTTP  response.In this article, we will dive into the system design of a , and explore the the 5 most commonly used with examples, pros and cons.Before diving into the architecture, lets outline the functional and non-functional requirements:1.1 Functional RequirementsEnforce a fixed number of requests per user or API key within a defined time window (e.g., 100 requests per minute). Excess requests should be rejected with an HTTP .Limits must be enforced consistently across all nodes in a distributed environment. Users shouldn't bypass limits by switching servers.Apply limits across multiple time granularities simultaneously (e.g., per second, per minute, per hour) to prevent abuse over short and long bursts.1.2 Non-Functional RequirementsTo be usable at scale, our distributed rate-limiter must meet several critical non-functional goals:The system should scale horizontally to handle massive request volumes and growing user counts.Rate limit checks should be fast ideally adding no more than a few milliseconds per request.The rate-limiter should continue working  even under heavy load or node failures. There should be no single point of failure.All nodes should have a  of each user’s request counts. This prevents a client from bypassing limits by routing requests through different servers.The system should support a large number of operations per second and serve many concurrent clients without significant performance degradation.The  acts as a  between the client and the backend servers. Its job is to inspect incoming requests and enforce predefined usage limits (e.g., 100 requests per minute per user or IP).To apply these limits effectively, the rate limiter must  for each client. These counts are often maintained across , such as per second, per minute, or per hour.Using a traditional relational database for this purpose is generally unsuitable due to:: Relational databases involve disk I/O, which introduces delays on every read/write.: Handling thousands of concurrent updates (e.g., one per incoming request) can lead to locks and race conditions.: RDBMSs are not optimized for high-frequency, real-time counter updates. An  like  is a far better fit for rate limiting use cases because it offers: for both reads and writes like , , and , ensuring safe concurrent updates without race conditionsTTL (Time-to-Live) support, allowing counters to reset automatically at the end of each time window (e.g., after 60 seconds for a per-minute limit)Here’s how the rate limiter fits into the flow of an incoming request: to an endpoint of the application.The  performs several checks:Identifies the client (via IP, token, or API key)Looks up the current request count in Redis (or in-memory cache)Applies any  (e.g., free vs premium users)If the count exceeds the allowed threshold, the request is  with HTTP 429 Too Many Requests.If the count is , the counter is incremented and the request proceeds to the backend service.Periodically,  via TTL or are reset based on window granularity.Many modern applications delegate rate limiting to  such as  or , which can efficiently enforce limits before traffic reaches backend services. However, for this discussion, we will focus on designing a  that is integrated into or called by  directly.3.1 Single-Node Rate LimitingFor small-scale applications with low traffic and a single application server, rate limiting can be implemented entirely , without relying on external systems like Redis. This approach is lightweight, fast, and easy to set up.You maintain a simple  in the application process where: represent client identifiers (e.g., user ID, API key, or IP address) represent request counts within the current time windowFor each incoming request:Checks if the user exists in the mapIf not, create a new entry with a count of 1If the user exists, increments their counterCompare the count against the defined rate limitIf the count is within the limit, allow the request; otherwise, reject itYou can also add a time-based mechanism (e.g., timestamps or TTL logic) to reset counters after each time window.Despite its simplicity, this approach comes with  that make it unsuitable for production environments at scale:Single Point of Failure (SPOF): If the server crashes, all in-memory counters are lost. After a restart, the system "forgets" users' recent request history potentially allowing them to exceed their limits until the counters rebuild.No Horizontal Scalability: The rate limiter lives on a so it doesn’t scale with traffic.Without proper eviction or TTL logic, memory usage can grow unbounded over time, especially if you're tracking many users or long-duration windows.Now, lets explore two common strategies to implement rate limiting in a distributed environment.3.2 Distributed Rate Limiting]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cofun with Cofree Comonads • David Laing • YOW! 2015</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddaxlm6ajhI</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>video</category><category>learning</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ddaxlm6ajhI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jun 2025 12:01:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences yt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This presentation was recorded at YOW! 2015. #GOTOcon #YOW
