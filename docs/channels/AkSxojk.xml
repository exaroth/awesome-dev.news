ABSTRACT
"I would have killed that if it was just me, 100%,” said Spotify founder and CEO Daniel Ek about Discover Weekly, a feature that would become one of Spotify’s most loved product features, almost a brand in itself.

Designers and senior engineers were equally skeptical, but the team was still able to ship the feature.

In this talk, you’ll learn how Spotify’s organisational culture of Agile management and autonomous teams enables innovation, using the Discover Weekly feature as an example. [...]

ABSTRACT
GitHub Copilot started life as code completion on steroids, but since its GA release in 2022, its capabilities have grown. GitHub Copilot now lives in more places than just your IDE. It's in your terminal, your browser, and in your pull requests. It can learn your entire codebase and help you understand it.

In this session, we'll look at what Copilot is, what it's become, and how it works. We'll run through the software engineering lifecycle from idea to production and highlight all the areas where tools like Copilot can save you time and effort. Finally, we'll talk about how GitHub Copilot was created, how it's being improved, and a little about the future of AI tooling. [...]

ABSTRACT
Inefficiency is ruining our planet and our lives. Efficiency is ruining our happiness, and weirdly, it’s also ruining our efficiency. Heeeeelppp!? What’s a techie to do? Zombie servers and slow code are a big climate problem, but the vrrrooom model gives us double-win hope. Holly walks through a range of techniques that can be used to find and eliminate software waste and reduce climate impacts.

But machine efficiency isn’t much use without human efficiency. Surprisingly, sorting out machine efficiency often helps humans, too. For example, the Quarkus Java framework uses many interesting waste-reduction techniques. These optimisations have the dual benefit of speeding up computers, and also speeding up people.

So far, so good, but we need to be careful we don’t end up accidentally optimising the wrong things, and making stuff worse. 100% utilisation is not sustainable for either humans, or people. It’s not even very efficient (what!?). Holly gives a brief tour of the brain’s default mode network, the latest business research, and queueing theory, to show why we actually achieve more when we do a bit less. [...]

DESCRIPTION
In this episode of GOTO Book Club, James Lewis and Russ Miles discuss Cloud Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPPs), focusing on how they promote collaboration across security and development teams.

Russ shares insights from his book, emphasizing the importance of OODA loops, balancing innovation with safety in platform design, and the benefits of off-the-shelf versus custom CNAPP solutions. Looking ahead, he predicts platform engineering will evolve into a commercial strategy like AWS and that AI will augment human decision-making, enhancing creativity and collaboration in the engineering field.

ABSTRACT
Many developers mistakenly view GraphQL as a graph database or as an alternative to REST. In reality, GraphQL’s greatest strength is its power to unify your existing APIs into a single, unified API.

In this talk, learn how a federated GraphQL architecture can help you build a scalable platform that maximizes the value of your existing APIs. Learn how to leverage federation to create a flexible, resilient API strategy that evolves with your business needs. [...]

One reason why it might still fail is because it could be that you are dealing with a badly calibrated model. The predictions might be fine, but the probability estimates can be way off. 

In this video we talk about how to think about calibration and what it means.
