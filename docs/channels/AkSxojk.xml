https://www.craiglarman.com/wiki/index.php?title=Larman%27s_Laws_of_Organizational_Behavior

ABSTRACT
Larman's Law states, "Organizations are implicitly optimized to avoid changing the status quo…" The third law is particularly relevant: 'Any change initiative will be derided as “purist,” "theoretical," “revolutionary," " “religion,” and “needing pragmatic customization for local concerns”—which deflects from addressing weaknesses and the manager/specialist status quo.'

You need to overcome that resistance to use innovative approaches like no-estimation or mob/ensemble programming.

Devs, however, almost always go about that the wrong way. Senior management is rarely interested in the mechanics of what you're doing. They're interested in the bottom line, how the new approaches change how the business is managed, and whether the inevitable disruption is worth it.

In this talk, you'll learn how to convince the “suits” (and your clients) that innovation is a good thing. You'll learn how to create a business case for innovation that overcomes the resistance of Larman's Law. [...]

ABSTRACT
Whenever a new technology appears, our first instinct as developers is to offer "text" as the primary method of interaction. This has happened throughout computing history, with the computer terminal, with early smartphones, and now it's happening again with AI.

At tldraw, we’ve been working on moving AI interaction away from the chat-based interface, towards a richer canvas environment. It hasn't been easy! I'll show you all the challenges we've faced, and how we're currently overcoming them. Some of the solutions have been surprising. [...]

ORIGINAL TALK TITLE
Change Your Life, Help Your Team & Boost Your Business with Neurodiversity

RESOURCES
https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrinekjeldsen

ABSTRACT
Are you a little spicy? If not, your colleague most probably is. Either way, this talk is for you.

In this session, Katrine will shine a light on neurodiversity and the transformative impact it can have on your life, your team, and your business.

Neurodiversity is not only abundantly prevalent in tech organizations; it is a powerful, often underutilized asset that manifests in every corner of our work environments. It is paramount that we adjust our understanding and strategies around this diversity to thrive. Katrine will explore how neurodiversity shows up in the most unexpected ways and why it’s both surprisingly easy and surprisingly challenging to harness its potential in team collaboration and leadership.

This talk will emphasize practical daily strategies to strengthen collaboration and leverage the advantages of neurodiversity in everyday work contexts, whether it’s adopting clear communication methods, allowing flexible work arrangements, or designing team workflows that play to diverse cognitive strengths.

DESCRIPTION
Jonah Andersson, interviewed by Håkan Silfvernagel, shared her experiences writing "Learning Microsoft Azure". With a focus on making the content accessible for beginners, she carefully structured the book to cover essential Azure topics such as cloud computing fundamentals, security, and AI, while drawing on insights from experts in her network, including Microsoft Certified Trainers and MVPs.

Over nearly two years, Jonah Andersson navigated the challenges of a rapidly evolving tech landscape, incorporating emerging trends like generative AI. Passionate about fostering inclusivity in tech, she emphasized the importance of mentorship and community support for underrepresented groups, particularly women. Looking ahead, Jonah Andersson expressed a desire to write a biography that reflects her life lessons and professional journey in technology.

Kafka Meets Iceberg: Real-Time Data Streaming into Modern Data Lakes & Warehouses

ABSTRACT
In this talk, we'll explore how Kafka serves as a powerful platform for capturing real-time streaming data and how organizations are increasingly adopting Apache Iceberg table format to store data in data lakes and data warehouses. We'll discuss the key benefits of using Apache Iceberg tables in your data lake such as schema evolution, ACID transactions, hidden partitioning, time traveling and efficient querying.

Next, we'll dive into how to efficiently stream data from Kafka into Iceberg-based data lakes. Confluent Tableflow will be introduced as a potential solution for streamlining the ingestion of Kafka streams into Iceberg tables within your data lake. A live demo will showcase the seamless integration of Kafka with Iceberg, equipping participants with practical knowledge to enhance their data architectures for powerful real-time analytics.

• The role of Kafka in real-time data streaming
• Why Apache Iceberg is essential for data lakes and data warehouses
• Iceberg fundamentals: Core concepts and key features
• Streaming data from Kafka to Iceberg tables in data lakes
• Use case: Leveraging Confluent Tableflow to stream Kafka data into data lakes and warehouses [...]

To add a number there, you need to use a scorer instead. The goal of this video is to explain the difference and to show how to leverage the `make_scorer` helper utility here.

DESCRIPTION
Kent Beck and Daniel Terhorst-North reflect on the evolution of Extreme Programming (XP) and its lasting impact on agile software development. They explore the importance of short feedback loops, iterative learning, and adaptability in different phases of product development, as outlined in Beck’s 3X model (Exploration, Expansion, Extraction).

Kent introduces radical techniques like Test && Commit || Revert (TCR) and Limbo, which challenge traditional coding and collaboration practices by emphasizing tiny, safe iterations. The conversation ties in psychological safety, a key factor in high-performing teams, as outlined by Amy C. Edmondson.

Kent envisions a future where software development scales in real-time, pushing teams to embrace faster experimentation, responsibility, and continuous learning in a rapidly evolving tech landscape. [...]
