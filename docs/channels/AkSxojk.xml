TruLens is an open source observability and evaluation framework designed to help teams understand, test, and improve Large Language Model (LLM) applications. As AI-powered systems become a core part of modern cloud-native platforms, TruLens provides critical insights into model behavior, quality, and trustworthiness—helping developers move beyond “black box” AI.

In this episode, Shivay will take a hands-on look at how TruLens works. Expect live experimentation, and an honest first look at where TruLens fits within the growing AI and cloud native ecosystem.

If you’re curious about LLM observability, responsible AI, or how open source communities are tackling AI evaluation challenges, this session is for you. Bring your questions, share your experiences, and learn alongside us as we explore TruLens together—live.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Building Agentic AI systems with AWS Serverless • Uma Ramadoss • GOTO 2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAcyi2BGwMo</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>video</category><category>learning</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/nAcyi2BGwMo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 13:01:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences yt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This presentation was recorded at GOTO Serverless 2025. #GOTOcon #GOTOserverless

ABSTRACT
Agentic AI is transforming enterprise applications but building them is not just about prompt engineering and model selection. Join this session to learn about agentic systems, how they are changing the way we work, and how to build them using open-source agents framework and AWS Serverless services such as Lambda, Step Functions, and Amazon Bedrock.

You'll learn the difference between AI enabled workflows and agentic workflows, when to choose agentic workflows and things to consider when building agent-based systems. [...]

DESCRIPTION
Microsoft Cloud Solution Architect Albert Tanure interviews Microsoft MVP Alexandre Malavasi about his fourth book, "Modern Full-Stack Web Development with ASP.NET Core". The discussion explores the challenges of writing comprehensive technical books, the importance of foundational knowledge in full stack development, and how to integrate ASP.NET Core with modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js.

Alexandre emphasizes that successful architecture decisions depend primarily on team expertise and the ability to facilitate change, rather than following trends.
The conversation also highlights the critical importance of looking beyond just coding - encompassing project planning, DevOps practices, monitoring, and continuous optimization - to truly bring value to customers and become well-rounded software engineers.

DESCRIPTION
Félix GV, a former engineer at LinkedIn and architect of the Venice database system, discusses the complexity of building planetary-scale data systems. He explains Venice's unbundled architecture where each component—from Kafka-based pub/sub to RocksDB-powered servers—operates as an independent distributed system. Félix details their rigorous chaos engineering practices, including regular load tests that push data centers beyond normal capacity to ensure reliability.

The discussion covers fundamental distributed systems concepts like the CAP theorem and the trade-offs between consistency and availability in multi-region deployments. He also explains why Venice, as a derived data system, deliberately sacrifices strong consistency for high throughput and availability, and concludes by discussing their experimental integration of DuckDB for SQL-based analytics and data exploration capabilities.

DESCRIPTION
Apache Spark contributor Holden Karau discusses the evolution of distributed data processing, the challenges of integrating machine learning with big data tools, and the technical complexities of working with GPUs at scale.

The conversation takes a personal turn as Holden reveals her latest project: an open-source AI tool that helps people appeal health insurance claim denials. Drawing from personal experiences with denied claims, she has built a system that trains on independent medical review data to generate effective appeals, making it freely available at https://fighthealthinsurance.com while grappling with the classic open-source challenge of sustainable funding.

DESCRIPTION
Andrew Harmel-Law explores the core concepts of effect oriented programming with authors Bill Frasure, Bruce Eckel, and James Ward. The discussion reveals that effects are composable operations that encapsulate side effects and defer execution, giving developers the right handles to manage unpredictability through compiler-checked types.
The authors explain how ZIO tracks three critical types: outputs, failures, and environmental requirements, enabling better testing with mock clocks and random number generators.

They share their intentional avoidance of intimidating functional programming terminology like "monads" proving you don't need mathematical foundations to understand effects. The conversation covers effect systems' expansion beyond Scala into TypeScript, Kotlin, and new languages like Unison and Roc, and how their collaborative writing process with strict constraints like 47-character line limits - created a coherent 100-page book readable in portrait mode on your phone.
