ABSTRACT
Minimum viable product is one of the most misunderstood, misused, and abused terms in contemporary software development.
In this talk Jeff will explain the misunderstandings made by thought leaders that lead to confusion we all deal with today. You’ll learn the counter-intuitive concepts hidden in the term and why really using them is so hard. You’ll learn about techniques that will ultimately help you find smaller successful releases, test your ideas faster, develop higher quality software more predictably, and release more confidently than ever before. Because hidden in this nasty little term are clues that can help you do all that.

Jeff Patton helps companies adopt a way of working that’s focused on building great products, not just building stuff faster. Jeff blends a mixture of Agile thinking, Lean and Lean Startup Thinking, and UX Design and Design Thinking to end up with a holistic product-centric way of working. Jeff is author of the bestselling O’Reilly book User Story Mapping which describes a simple holistic approach to using stories in Agile development without losing sight of the big picture.

Standardizing Authentication Flows in Keycloak Environments – Efficient Authorization Strategies Using OPA - Yuta Kato, CyberAgent, Inc.

In this session, we will explain how we standardized and streamlined authentication flows to address the growing workload faced by engineers due to the rapid increase in authentication services.

To tackle the challenging task of building individual authentication flows for over 100 services, we adopted an implementation approach that defines authorization levels using role information and leverages attribute data stored in Keycloak.

By accurately linking user information with imported role data and standardizing authentication flows, we enabled faster updates to authorization systems. Additionally, we implemented centralized policy management for each client using OPA (Open Policy Agent) and policy language, significantly improving maintenance efficiency.

This session will provide practical and scalable design strategies and implementation methods for building robust systems that address authorization strategies using OPA.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Sponsored Keynote: Hitachi’s Keycloak Journey - Evolution of Business and Community - Michito Okai</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUR9_gZZOfY</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>k8s</category><category>devops</category><category>video</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/dUR9_gZZOfY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 13:49:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

How To Manage Keycloak Securely by Using Terraform on Google Cloud - Atsushi Kitano, Cloud Ace

We have launched a new service which monitors customers' systems.
It uses Keycloak to authenticate for customers and developers to use our service components, for instance, Grafana, ArgoCD, Backstage, Redmine, and so on.

So, Keycloak has personal information, and we have to manage it securely.
We're using Terraform to configure Keycloak, not for making mistakes due to creating by hand. And we don't want to encounter errors when running Terraform code from the developer's PC.
So we're running it from the CD agent. We use Cloud Build, a Google Cloud product, because it provides a private pool that allows us to use a specific IP address.

We'll introduce how to build this CD system and how to use Terraform in my session.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>No More Configuration Confusion!

OpenID Federation Trust Chain on Keycloak for Highly Assured Use Cases of Digital Identity Wallet - Yutaka Obuchi, Hitachi

OpenID Federation 1.0 provides a framework to build trust between a Relying Party and an OpenID Provider that have no direct relationship so that the Relying Party can send OIDC/OAuth requests to the OpenID Provider without being previously registered.

One primary use case is the trust between an Issuer and a Holder (Wallet) on W3C’s Verifiable Credential Data Model, which is getting a lot of attentions as an approach to realize the Digital Identity Wallet ecosystem.
Especially when high assurance level is needed like EU Digital Identity Wallet, OpenID Federation can provide a strong solution.

In this session:
Firstly I will explain OpenID Federation and the reason why it is important for Digital Identity Wallet ecosystem.
Then I will explain what types of roles Keycloak can play with OpenID Federation Trust Chain.
Also I will show a simple demo of client registration with OpenID Federation Trust Chain on Keycloak.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Keynote: AI Agents with Keycloak in MCP - Takashi Norimatsu, Senior OSS Specialist, Hitachi Ltd.</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CsygNAJt-0</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>k8s</category><category>devops</category><category>video</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/-CsygNAJt-0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 13:49:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Keynote: AI Agents with Keycloak in MCP - Takashi Norimatsu, Senior OSS Specialist, Hitachi Ltd.

In this talk, Takashi investigates the possibility of integrating Keycloak with AI agents.
In the field of AI agents, Model Context Protocol (MCP) becomes a hot topic, which makes it easy for an AI agent/tool to connect internal/external services.

When an AI agent/tool implementing an MCP client accesses a remote external service implementing an MCP server, end user authentication and authorization is sometimes required. According to the MCP specification, OAuth 2.1 needs to be used for that, which implies that there is the possibility of using Keycloak for end user authentication and authorization because Keycloak supported OAuth 2.1.

Firstly, Takashi talks about MCP briefly and describes end user authentication and authorization of MCP in more detail. After that, the speaker shows the possible system configuration that includes Keycloak as a part of the MCP server.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Add Useful AI to Your Web App (Not Just Chatbots) • Steve Sanderson • GOTO 2024</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ_Ize3knj0</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>video</category><category>learning</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/xZ_Ize3knj0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 12:02:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences yt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This presentation was recorded at GOTO Copenhagen 2024. #GOTOcon #GOTOcph

ABSTRACT
Web developers: AI offers a fantastic opportunity to make your web UIs genuinely more intelligent and productive than before. But don't just throw on a chatbot and call it done, as people may not even use it. Let's explore how language models can integrate into your existing web UIs, anticipating your users' needs and completing their tasks faster.

While this is a technical, demo-centric talk, it isn't about how LLMs or transformers work internally, nor just how to use Open AI SDKs from a particular language. Instead, it focuses on practical, end-to-end uses for AI in web apps, making your users happier and more productive. [...]

ABSTRACT
Rust is modern programming language that is only growing in popularity. It is often lauded for its approach to memory safety, particularly through making previously implicit concepts like data ownership explicit. On top of it comes a powerful reference validation system, the borrow checker.

However, Rust is often reduced to those two concepts. This talk will give an accessible overview to using Rust core principles - Ownership and Borrowing - together with other, lesser known concepts of the language to build safe and efficient APIs.

For Rust practicioners, this talk gives insight into known concepts in more detail. It does so by looking at examples from the Rust standard library first and foremost. For people who don't practice Rust regularly, it gives an insight into properties of the language that are less spoken about. [...]
