DESCRIPTION
Programming education has a critical blind spot: while we extensively teach code creation, we barely scratch the surface of testing and give almost no attention to debugging—despite debugging consuming half of all software development time.

In this conversation with Clare Sudbery, Prof. Andreas Zeller argues that systematic debugging skills and modern automated debugging tools are the "ugly stepchild" of programming that nobody wants to discuss, yet debugging represents the biggest business risk and time sink in software development. As AI-driven coding becomes more prevalent, this gap will only widen, making investment in proper debugging education and tools not just beneficial but essential for the future of software development.

Lightning Talk: Optimizing Web Applications by Offloading Heavy Processing To Kubernetes Jobs - Asami Okina, Craftsman Software, Inc.

While typical web applications do not require large amounts of resources constantly, there are cases where specific processes consume significant CPU and memory.

In this session, we will introduce an architecture that offloads such resource-intensive processes to Kubernetes Jobs.

We will explain specific methods for Job management, how to integrate web applications (Next.js, @kubernetes/client-node) with the Kubernetes API, methods for data integration between Jobs and web applications, and real-time tracking of Job progress in the UI, all while sharing practical examples. Furthermore, we will provide a detailed introduction to a pattern where Kubernetes Job definitions generated from applications are managed using ConfigMaps, enabling quick configuration switching between environments, and offer hints to optimize your applications in terms of cost, performance, and management.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Health Insurance Appeals with Generative AI: From Lab to Production • Holden Karau • GOTO 2024</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5muBDDdhJg</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>video</category><category>learning</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Q5muBDDdhJg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 2 Jul 2025 12:00:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences yt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2024. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo

ABSTRACT
This talk will cover how we created a system to generate health insurance appeals from denials. We'll start with a quick look at the different attempts at model fine-tuning (along with what eventually worked well for us), then look at the middleware, how we integrate in-house and external models, steps to protect privacy, and finally, some truly questionable frontend code (or truly great frontend code if we finish the rewrite in time—you never know).

If you love the American healthcare system as it stands today, this is probably not the talk for you. For those ambivalent about the healthcare system, that's totally fine; you can still see what it takes to bring an ML system from drinks at a bar all the way through to production. [...]

Platform Engineering Day 2: Why Service Iterations Are the Crux of Developer Platforms - Puja Abbassi, Giant Swarm

Everyone is talking about platform engineering. You see smooth demos of golden paths and self-service platforms. However, there’s a significant area of challenges that is less talked about and thus often neglected when designing developer platforms.

In this talk, we’ll explore the often-overlooked day 2 challenges that platform teams face. We’ll dissect the area of day 2 into the many sub-areas and challenges they pose. Drawing on real-world experiences, including notable migrations that many in this community have faced, we'll shed light on the pain behind developer platforms and discuss solutions to these issues. Among others, we’ll delve into practical strategies for managing versioning and rollouts, and highlight the significant hurdles encountered, such as dependencies on end user teams or GitOps.

Join us for insights, strategies, and stories from the trenches that will help you navigate the complexities of service iteration in developer platforms.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Keynote: OpenTelemetry And The Future of Open Source Observability - Austin Parker, Honeycomb</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hERRANApN5c</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>k8s</category><category>devops</category><category>video</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/hERRANApN5c?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 17:35:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Sponsored Keynote: Why Semantic Conventions are OpenTelemetry’s Most Important Contribution - Gordon Radlein, Datadog

OpenTelemetry has accelerated the commoditization of instrumentation. Telemetry generation is becoming a solved problem, an implementation detail. But this has created a new challenge: a wealth of standardized signals with no standard meaning. Different systems instrumented with different semantics generating telemetry in their own unique language. And while signal correlation connects specific workloads, it fails when we need to understand our systems at a macro scale by joining disparate datasets.
That is, until we all agreed to speak the same language.

Just as English as a lingua franca fueled progress across the internet, OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions are providing a shared language for our systems. In this talk we’ll discuss why semantic interoperability is the real connective tissue, how it’s fueling deeper insights into our production environments, and the key role it plays in enabling the AI systems that are rapidly ushering in the next revolution of our industry.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Welcome + Opening Remarks - Austin Parker, Honeycomb</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rqgWHaEvgc</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>k8s</category><category>devops</category><category>video</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/_rqgWHaEvgc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 17:35:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Sponsored Keynote: Manage Logging Costs While Preserving Value - Alok Bhide, Chronosphere

Logs can get very expensive and often how useful all those logs are is unknown, some are but many are not. It is very difficult to know which logs are useful and how exactly they are used. With Chronosphere's Control plane for logs users can now get a comprehensive analysis of value and usage patterns, along with sophisticated recommendations and control actions that allow some or most of the value derived from those logs to be preserved. In order to achieve our goals we have enhanced Fluent Bit to be more flexible in which logs are actioned upon and will share useful future additions to it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Keynote: Hybrid Cloud Architecture: Making Big Bets on Open Standards - Margaret Dawson</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_hHiwa_3QU</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>k8s</category><category>devops</category><category>video</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/J_hHiwa_3QU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 17:35:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Keynote: Hybrid Cloud Architecture: Making Big Bets on Open Standards - Margaret Dawson, Chronosphere

Hybrid cloud isn’t a stepping stone—it’s a destination. With 39% of CNCF survey respondents already operating in hybrid environments, this model is here to stay. But as teams pursue cloud-native architectures, many skip a critical step: developing a clear cloud strategy and an observability approach to match.
The result is predictable— widening visibility gaps, redundant tooling and data, and spiraling costs as teams try to stitch together disconnected, vendor-specific systems never meant to work in concert. Hybrid environments expose these issues quickly, especially when workloads span multiple platforms without a unified way to observe and understand them.
Modernization efforts demand open observability from the start—not as an add-on. Technologies like OpenTelemetry, Fluent Bit, and Prometheus act as connective tissue across clouds, clusters, and on-prem infrastructure, enabling standardization where it’s needed most.
This talk outlines how to center open observability in your modernization journey: where to standardize architectural layers, how to maintain a more open approach, and why these decisions have long-term payoff. 
Hybrid complexity is inevitable. Leading with open observability is how you stay in control—now and in the future.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Sponsored Keynote: Foundation-Led Innovation: OpenSearch&apos;s Impact on Modern Data I...

Telemetry Showdown: Fluent Bit Vs. OpenTelemetry Collector - A Comprehensive Benchmark Analysis - Henrik Rexed, Dynatrace

In a push to standardize observability practices, the cloud-native community has embraced OpenTelemetry, offering a unified framework for metrics, logs, and traces. Prior to this, log processing relied on agents like fluent, evolving into fluentbit. With fluentbit's recent expansion to support additional signals and the OpenTelemetry Collector's emergence, a pertinent question arises: Which is the superior choice for performance?

This session delves into:
- Unveiling the distinctions between Fluent Bit and the OpenTelemetry Collector.
- Sharing the findings derived from a series of benchmark tests.
- Providing valuable insights to empower the community in selecting the most fitting agent for their cloud-native environments.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Spec-tacular Game Show - Liudmila Molkova, Ted Young, Tyler Helmuth, Jamie Danielson, Alex Boten</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipFVu0dl5Bw</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>k8s</category><category>devops</category><category>video</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ipFVu0dl5Bw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 17:34:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Panel: The Spec-tacular Game Show - Liudmila Molkova, Microsoft; Ted Young, Grafana Labs; Tyler Helmuth, Jamie Danielson & Alex Boten, Honeycomb

From OTLP to OTTL, engineers are excited about a lot of things. But there is one thing that excites them above all else and that is correcting people. Welcome to “The Spec-tacular Game Show”.

In this fun game show our panelists will be given incorrect statements about the OpenTelemetry Specification or Semantic Convention. The panelists will buzz in, identify what’s wrong, and state the correction. If none of the panelists know the answer the audience will get a chance to answer to steal the point. The panelist (or audience) with the most points wins!

After each question we’ll spend a time explaining why the Spec and Semconv is the way it is and highlight how it produces the production-quality telemetry you know and love. Join us for a fun, relaxing, (snarky) panel about everyone’s favorite part of Otel!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How To Think About Instrumentation Overhead - Jason Plumb, Splunk</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvmzAX_ZyvM</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>k8s</category><category>devops</category><category>video</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/fvmzAX_ZyvM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 17:34:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

How To Think About Instrumentation Overhead - Jason Plumb, Splunk

Novice observability practitioners are often overly obsessed with performance. They might approach instrumentation with skepticism and have concerns about latency degradation or resource consumption. This talk is a primer on the topic of instrumentation overhead, and it will teach you how to think about overhead in an observability context. We will cover the causes of overhead and why overhead is so hard to measure and even harder to predict reliably. Lastly, we will present some practical techniques for understanding overhead in your environment and some strategies for coping with it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>No Dependencies.

No Dependencies. No Plugins. Just Native OpenTelemetry - Liudmila Molkova, Microsoft

The best telemetry starts at the source—inside the client libraries.
But in most cases, that means taking a dependency on the OpenTelemetry API from your library. And while it’s stable, minimal, reliable, and safely no-op unless configured—transitive dependencies are still the bane of any library developer’s existence, and most of us try to avoid them.

To work around this, people reach for abstractions, plugins, bridges, or even OTel forks that break context propagation. The result? A poor user experience. Users must find the right plugin, install it, wire it up—and still hit the diamond dependency problem, now it just affects a subset of users.

But what if you could take a truly optional dependency? If OpenTelemetry is on the classpath, instrumentation kicks in. If it’s not, no harm done.
How hard is that to pull off? How reliable? How performant?

Let’s explore that—through the lens of the next generation of Azure SDKs for Java. Spoiler: it’s easy and fast, and as a side-bonus, we can fall back to logs-based tracing if OTel is not found.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Closing Remarks - Austin Parker, Honeycomb</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDbQfZ9eoNI</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>k8s</category><category>devops</category><category>video</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/eDbQfZ9eoNI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 17:34:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Lightning Talk: Beyond Good Enough: Why We Want a Kotlin API and SDK - Hanson Ho, Embrace

The OTel Java API, SDK, and ecosystem are perfectly adequate for Android developer to get OTel instrumentation into their apps. But for a host of reasons, the match is not perfect, especially for developers who only write in Kotlin, which is the recommended development language for Android by Google, not the least of which is the emergence of Kotlin Multiple Platform (KMP) as a means to share code between Android, iOS, and many other platforms.

This session will outline the reasons why we at Embrace is trying to kick-start the development of a pure Kotlin ecosystem for OTel, starting with an API and SDK implementation, and how we are doing it in a way where mobile developers can get value incrementally without having to wait until every aspect is fully built out.

We want OTel to feel natural and idiomatic for Android developers, and this is the first step towards that end.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>They Hired Me to Steal a Shopping Cart Full of Human DNA 🧬 Darknet Diaries Ep. 160: Greg</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV5XVcNLHzs</link><author>Jack Rhysider</author><category>infosec</category><category>video</category><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/YV5XVcNLHzs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 14:30:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMIqrmh2lMdzhlCPK5ahsAg">Darknet diaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Greg Linares (AKA Laughing Mantis) shares his hunts for Zero Day exploits, the triple(?) agent working at Microsoft, how he became the youngest hacker ever arrested in Arizona, and that time a client hired him to steal human DNA.

DESCRIPTION
When FundApps exploded from 20 to 50+ engineers in just one year, their old "everyone does support" model crumbled spectacularly. Software engineer Flavia Circiumaru and host Hannes Lowette dive deep into how this London-based regulatory compliance company transformed from a support-free-for-all to a streamlined powerhouse.

Flavia Circiumaru reveals the behind-the-scenes story of building a three-desk support system that turned their support team into the ultimate connector, bridging customers, developers, and business teams like never before. From battling context-switching nightmares to creating communication magic, Flavia and Hannes explore actionable insights on scaling support without losing your sanity.

The twist? Their ultimate goal is to make support so seamless that dedicated teams won't even be needed. Talk about engineering your way out of a job!

ABSTRACT
So, you’ve written a #DSL, it’s a work of art! It so perfectly models the problem at hand that even a trained house cat could generate business value. You just have one problem, your interpreter runs 100x slower than a shell script launching JVMs in a loop.

#DomainSpecificLanguages (DSLs) are able to offer the abstraction benefits of a high-level language, while when compiled, competing with low-level languages on performance. Because DSLs have a much smaller problem area, many specialised optimisations can be performed which are not feasible for a general purpose language.

In this talk, we will explain a number of optimisations which are useful for DSLs, and show our solutions to the practical issues we faced when implementing them in our #QueryLanguage, #Icicle.

Icicle is a query language for processing large amounts of time-series data. Its type system enforces that queries require only a single pass over the data, and that multiple queries over the same data can be fused together. By using a combination of high level optimisations such as partial evaluation and common subexpression elimination, and low level optimisations such as parsing code which is specialised for the given input, our queries are faster than the equivalent hand-written C code.

From this talk, the audience will learn how the focused point of view that DSLs provide can be useful in performance critical systems, as well as a number of concrete techniques for optimising their own DSLs.

ABSTRACT
The production of software is a complex, collaborative process that stretches our ability as human beings to cope with its demands. Many people working in #SoftwareDevelopment spend their careers without seeing what good really looks like.

Our history is littered with inefficient processes creating poor quality output, too late to capitalise on the expected business value.
How have we got into this state?
How do we get past it?
What does good really look like?

Continuous Delivery changes the economics of software development for some of the biggest companies in the world, whatever the nature of their software development, find out how and why.

ABSTRACT
This talk will demonstrate how AI, via transformers, can lift limits on core cognitive processes like attention, synthesis, and retention.

These insights will allow you to use AI more effectively to scaffold and accelerate your own learning.

After all, generative AI can do far more to propel our learning than simply answer questions (important and helpful though that may be!).

Generative AI is, in essence, a teacher—but it can teach better if you know how its properties are sometimes similar to, and sometimes very different from, how the human brain works. [...]

DESCRIPTION
Eduardo da Silva and Simon Rohrer discuss the core ideas of "Better Value Sooner Safer Happier" diving into the principles of organizational transformation.

Simon shares insights on the shift from output-driven to outcome-focused thinking, emphasizing value over productivity, and the need for continuous improvement in delivery speed, stakeholder satisfaction, and safety.
The conversation explores key concepts like technical excellence, integrating safety into development, and balancing incremental changes with occasional larger steps.

Simon Rohrer discusses organizational patterns and the importance of decentralizing decision-making, recommending a flexible, context-driven approach to transformation. The session concludes with practical advice on how to start implementing these ideas, using the book’s map to guide organizations toward the right transformation strategy based on their specific goals.
