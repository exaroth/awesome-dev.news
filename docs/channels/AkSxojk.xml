Sponsored Keynote: Why Semantic Conventions are OpenTelemetry’s Most Important Contribution - Gordon Radlein, Datadog

OpenTelemetry has accelerated the commoditization of instrumentation. Telemetry generation is becoming a solved problem, an implementation detail. But this has created a new challenge: a wealth of standardized signals with no standard meaning. Different systems instrumented with different semantics generating telemetry in their own unique language. And while signal correlation connects specific workloads, it fails when we need to understand our systems at a macro scale by joining disparate datasets.
That is, until we all agreed to speak the same language.

Just as English as a lingua franca fueled progress across the internet, OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions are providing a shared language for our systems. In this talk we’ll discuss why semantic interoperability is the real connective tissue, how it’s fueling deeper insights into our production environments, and the key role it plays in enabling the AI systems that are rapidly ushering in the next revolution of our industry.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Welcome + Opening Remarks - Austin Parker, Honeycomb</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rqgWHaEvgc</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>k8s</category><category>devops</category><category>video</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/_rqgWHaEvgc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 17:35:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Sponsored Keynote: Manage Logging Costs While Preserving Value - Alok Bhide, Chronosphere

Logs can get very expensive and often how useful all those logs are is unknown, some are but many are not. It is very difficult to know which logs are useful and how exactly they are used. With Chronosphere's Control plane for logs users can now get a comprehensive analysis of value and usage patterns, along with sophisticated recommendations and control actions that allow some or most of the value derived from those logs to be preserved. In order to achieve our goals we have enhanced Fluent Bit to be more flexible in which logs are actioned upon and will share useful future additions to it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Keynote: Hybrid Cloud Architecture: Making Big Bets on Open Standards - Margaret Dawson</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_hHiwa_3QU</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>k8s</category><category>devops</category><category>video</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/J_hHiwa_3QU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 17:35:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Keynote: Hybrid Cloud Architecture: Making Big Bets on Open Standards - Margaret Dawson, Chronosphere

Hybrid cloud isn’t a stepping stone—it’s a destination. With 39% of CNCF survey respondents already operating in hybrid environments, this model is here to stay. But as teams pursue cloud-native architectures, many skip a critical step: developing a clear cloud strategy and an observability approach to match.
The result is predictable— widening visibility gaps, redundant tooling and data, and spiraling costs as teams try to stitch together disconnected, vendor-specific systems never meant to work in concert. Hybrid environments expose these issues quickly, especially when workloads span multiple platforms without a unified way to observe and understand them.
Modernization efforts demand open observability from the start—not as an add-on. Technologies like OpenTelemetry, Fluent Bit, and Prometheus act as connective tissue across clouds, clusters, and on-prem infrastructure, enabling standardization where it’s needed most.
This talk outlines how to center open observability in your modernization journey: where to standardize architectural layers, how to maintain a more open approach, and why these decisions have long-term payoff. 
Hybrid complexity is inevitable. Leading with open observability is how you stay in control—now and in the future.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Sponsored Keynote: Foundation-Led Innovation: OpenSearch&apos;s Impact on Modern Data I...

No Dependencies. No Plugins. Just Native OpenTelemetry - Liudmila Molkova, Microsoft

The best telemetry starts at the source—inside the client libraries.
But in most cases, that means taking a dependency on the OpenTelemetry API from your library. And while it’s stable, minimal, reliable, and safely no-op unless configured—transitive dependencies are still the bane of any library developer’s existence, and most of us try to avoid them.

To work around this, people reach for abstractions, plugins, bridges, or even OTel forks that break context propagation. The result? A poor user experience. Users must find the right plugin, install it, wire it up—and still hit the diamond dependency problem, now it just affects a subset of users.

But what if you could take a truly optional dependency? If OpenTelemetry is on the classpath, instrumentation kicks in. If it’s not, no harm done.
How hard is that to pull off? How reliable? How performant?

Let’s explore that—through the lens of the next generation of Azure SDKs for Java. Spoiler: it’s easy and fast, and as a side-bonus, we can fall back to logs-based tracing if OTel is not found.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Closing Remarks - Austin Parker, Honeycomb</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDbQfZ9eoNI</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>k8s</category><category>devops</category><category>video</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/eDbQfZ9eoNI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 1 Jul 2025 17:34:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Lightning Talk: Beyond Good Enough: Why We Want a Kotlin API and SDK - Hanson Ho, Embrace

The OTel Java API, SDK, and ecosystem are perfectly adequate for Android developer to get OTel instrumentation into their apps. But for a host of reasons, the match is not perfect, especially for developers who only write in Kotlin, which is the recommended development language for Android by Google, not the least of which is the emergence of Kotlin Multiple Platform (KMP) as a means to share code between Android, iOS, and many other platforms.

This session will outline the reasons why we at Embrace is trying to kick-start the development of a pure Kotlin ecosystem for OTel, starting with an API and SDK implementation, and how we are doing it in a way where mobile developers can get value incrementally without having to wait until every aspect is fully built out.

DESCRIPTION
When FundApps exploded from 20 to 50+ engineers in just one year, their old "everyone does support" model crumbled spectacularly. Software engineer Flavia Circiumaru and host Hannes Lowette dive deep into how this London-based regulatory compliance company transformed from a support-free-for-all to a streamlined powerhouse.

Flavia Circiumaru reveals the behind-the-scenes story of building a three-desk support system that turned their support team into the ultimate connector, bridging customers, developers, and business teams like never before. From battling context-switching nightmares to creating communication magic, Flavia and Hannes explore actionable insights on scaling support without losing your sanity.

The twist? Their ultimate goal is to make support so seamless that dedicated teams won't even be needed. Talk about engineering your way out of a job!

ABSTRACT
So, you’ve written a #DSL, it’s a work of art! It so perfectly models the problem at hand that even a trained house cat could generate business value. You just have one problem, your interpreter runs 100x slower than a shell script launching JVMs in a loop.

#DomainSpecificLanguages (DSLs) are able to offer the abstraction benefits of a high-level language, while when compiled, competing with low-level languages on performance. Because DSLs have a much smaller problem area, many specialised optimisations can be performed which are not feasible for a general purpose language.

In this talk, we will explain a number of optimisations which are useful for DSLs, and show our solutions to the practical issues we faced when implementing them in our #QueryLanguage, #Icicle.

Icicle is a query language for processing large amounts of time-series data. Its type system enforces that queries require only a single pass over the data, and that multiple queries over the same data can be fused together. By using a combination of high level optimisations such as partial evaluation and common subexpression elimination, and low level optimisations such as parsing code which is specialised for the given input, our queries are faster than the equivalent hand-written C code.

From this talk, the audience will learn how the focused point of view that DSLs provide can be useful in performance critical systems, as well as a number of concrete techniques for optimising their own DSLs.

ABSTRACT
The production of software is a complex, collaborative process that stretches our ability as human beings to cope with its demands. Many people working in #SoftwareDevelopment spend their careers without seeing what good really looks like.

Our history is littered with inefficient processes creating poor quality output, too late to capitalise on the expected business value.
How have we got into this state?
How do we get past it?
What does good really look like?

Continuous Delivery changes the economics of software development for some of the biggest companies in the world, whatever the nature of their software development, find out how and why.

Lightning Talk: Optimizing Web Applications by Offloading Heavy Processing To Kubernetes Jobs - Asami Okina, Craftsman Software, Inc.

While typical web applications do not require large amounts of resources constantly, there are cases where specific processes consume significant CPU and memory.

In this session, we will introduce an architecture that offloads such resource-intensive processes to Kubernetes Jobs.

We will explain specific methods for Job management, how to integrate web applications (Next.js, @kubernetes/client-node) with the Kubernetes API, methods for data integration between Jobs and web applications, and real-time tracking of Job progress in the UI, all while sharing practical examples. Furthermore, we will provide a detailed introduction to a pattern where Kubernetes Job definitions generated from applications are managed using ConfigMaps, enabling quick configuration switching between environments, and offer hints to optimize your applications in terms of cost, performance, and management.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Using Generative AI to Strengthen &amp; Accelerate Learning • Barbara Oakley • GOTO 2024</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbTaEsieWsU</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>video</category><category>learning</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/rbTaEsieWsU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 12:01:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences yt</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This presentation was recorded at GOTO Copenhagen 2024. #GOTOcon #GOTOcph

ABSTRACT
This talk will demonstrate how AI, via transformers, can lift limits on core cognitive processes like attention, synthesis, and retention.

These insights will allow you to use AI more effectively to scaffold and accelerate your own learning.

After all, generative AI can do far more to propel our learning than simply answer questions (important and helpful though that may be!).

Generative AI is, in essence, a teacher—but it can teach better if you know how its properties are sometimes similar to, and sometimes very different from, how the human brain works. [...]

New Cache Hierarchy for Container Images and OCI Artifact in Kubernetes Clusters Using Containerd - Toru Komatsu & Hidehito Yabuuchi, Preferred Networks, Inc.

One of the key bottlenecks in Kubernetes pod startup is the time taken to pull container images and OCI artifacts. It’s also costly to fetch large container images from the registry often. To tackle this problem, we developed a cache system with the following features:

* New Cache Hierarchy: Images pulled by pods are shared across the entire cluster, enabling cluster-wide optimization, not only cluster-local cache.
* Ninja: Users experience faster container image pulls without any changes on their part. Just like a ninja, the system stealthily enhances performance.
* Preheating: It supports pushing images to preheat the cache for subsequent pulls.

Deployed in a production cluster, the cache system has achieved a cache hit rate of around 95%, significantly reducing pod startup times and network communication with registries.

2-Node Kubernetes: A Reliable and Compatible Solution - Xin Zhang & Guang Hu, Microsoft

High availability in Kubernetes typically requires a 3-node setup to support etcd's Raft algorithm. But what if you could achieve HA with only 2 nodes, slashing infrastructure costs by over 30% without sacrificing reliability? This is a game-changer, especially for deployments in retail and manufacturing scaling across hundreds or thousands of locations.

Join us to explore a groundbreaking 2-node HA Kubernetes solution, built by evolving the Raft algorithm for etcd. Unlike alternatives that compromise on compatibility, our approach delivers etcd-based HA, which can tolerate both node failures and network partitioning like a traditional 3-node cluster. You can seamlessly transit between 3-node and 2-node cluster utilizing standard tools like kubeadm or CAPI. This approach requires only a simple shared storage witness.

In this session, we will unpack the mechanics of this innovation, demonstrate 2-node cluster provisioning, and showcase its resilience under real-world failure scenarios.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Add Single-sign-on To Your Applications With Keycloak and Learn...

Breaking Limits: Highly-Isolated and Low-Overhead Wasm Container - Soichiro Ueda, Kyoto University & Ai Nozaki, The University of Tokyo

Wasm is touted as the next generation of containers, offering a smaller, more secure, and more portable application format. However, challenges remain, particularly in achieving enough isolation for public clouds where multi-tenancy exists. This is because Wasm shares the host kernel between workloads like containers. To take full advantage of Wasm, there is still insufficient discussion on this problem.

To address the issue, we've developed a new Wasm runtime, Mewz. It runs a single Wasm module within a dedicated VM while also having a lightweight and specialized kernel (unikernel). This revolutionary execution model enables more secure and low-overhead Wasm containers. We've open-sourced the implementation, and Mewz is listed in the CNCF cloud native landscape! In this session, we'll explain the architecture of Mewz and why it's more isolated and low-overhead than ordinary Wasm runtimes. Building on this presentation, let’s discuss the future of cloud workloads powered by Wasm!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Streamlined Baremetal Deployment: A Journey of Custom Controll...

The Grand Adventure of Production Apps: Build, Break, and Survive! ~ A Kawaii Manga Journey Through - Aoi Takahashi, Independent

"I've started to understand the basics of Kubernetes, but when it comes to running it in production, I can't quite imagine what kind of issues might arise..."

To ease these concerns, this session will use original characters, illustrations, and animations in a “cute manga” style to visually demonstrate how production applications can break and how to troubleshoot them.
In our story, the main application as a character takes center stage as the hero, venturing out on a grand journey—only to be "suddenly attacked by a monster" at the most inopportune moment. By following this storyline, you will learn both how applications fail and how to fix them. Additionally, just as an adventurer equips better armor to prepare for future battles, we will explore common issues and explain how to prevent them from happening in the first place.

Never Underestimate Memory Architecture - Bryan Boreham, Grafana Labs

Modern cloud servers are built on NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) and SMT (Symmetric Multi-Threading, aka Hyperthreading) — but few engineers realize how much these technologies impact application performance.

NUMA means that your cloud server’s memory might be significantly slower to access, because it’s connected to a different CPU, while Hyperthreading makes a single CPU core pretend to be two, but not at twice the speed.

This talk will:
• Demystify NUMA & Hyperthreading — what they are, how they work, and why they matter.
• Explore Kubernetes integration—the (limited) ways Kubernetes interacts with NUMA.
• Show real-world performance impact — illustrated with measurements on AWS and Google Cloud.
• Give you visibility — how to use Prometheus metrics and Linux commands to view your servers’ NUMA and SMT configurations.

By the end of the session, you'll have an understanding of the issues, and the tools to measure and their impact on the performance of your workloads.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Keynote: Expanding Cloud Native Ecosystem From Japan - Yuichi Nakamura</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqKJwkZtZRQ</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>k8s</category><category>devops</category><category>video</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/xqKJwkZtZRQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 20:48:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

All of this is really useful information that can be used by the developer building AI Infused applications.

It’s also totally aligned with the Platform Engineering vision which tries to streamline the service catalogs to its platform user.

Join me in the mainly live coding session to see how to integrate MCP Metadata into your Platform Engineering strategy.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Deaf and Hard of Hearing WG Meeting - 2025-06-24</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5D5oWhczYU</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>k8s</category><category>devops</category><category>video</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/l5D5oWhczYU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 14:13:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

ABSTRACT
One of the most contentious words in technology culture today is “Architect.” I experience an endless stream of divisive, confusing opinions about what "architecture" means. At a conference, an attendee noticed that my badge said "architect" and told me "I want to be an architect too, but I don't know enough about Kubernetes yet".

Architecture, in the systems age, is not (just) Kubernetes. It's not the implementation of any particular toolset. Architecture is designing relationships between parts and adapting those relationship patterns as circumstances change. This requires engaging our mental models and working together to transform them.

The architecture skillset is socio-technical -- a blend of social and technology skills. It is a way of thinking and communicating. In the modern age, there is no division between the way we think together and the code running in production. Our thinking designs our architecture.

Architecture is structuring good systems thinking.

In this talk, I will admit that sometimes architecture is Kubernetes. And share five essential qualities that make a good architect a great architect, regardless of the toolset they employ. [...]
