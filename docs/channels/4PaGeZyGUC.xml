ABSTRACT
There‚Äôs no such thing as the perfect programming language. I‚Äôm sorry, but there isn‚Äôt, and I‚Äôll explain why.

On the other hand, if you were set the task of designing the perfect language, how close could you get, how would you go about it, and what would it look like in the end? We‚Äôre going to explore this problem space with a tour along the bleeding edge of modern language design, giving you some insight into what‚Äôs already out there, what tradeoffs each new idea comes with, and what sort of tools you might be working with in a future where programming is slightly less awful than it is today.

Jos√© Andr√©s discovers that his great-great-grandmother, Oracia, was abandoned as a child and left to nuns. Most abandoned children at that time did not fare well, but Oracia beat the odds, being adopted by a mystery couple who set her up with financial stability. She would later marry, start a family -- and open a bakery -- an ambition that chef Jos√© shares!

Twice named one of Time Magazine‚Äôs ‚Äú100 Most Influential People‚Äù and awarded ‚ÄúOutstanding Chef‚Äù and ‚ÄúHumanitarian of the Year‚Äù by the James Beard Foundation, Jos√© Andr√©s is an internationally recognized humanitarian, culinary innovator, New York Times bestselling author, educator, Emmy-winning television personality, and owner of the award-winning Jos√© Andr√©s Group, which operates nearly 40 restaurants in the US and beyond. In 2010, Andr√©s founded World Central Kitchen, a nonprofit organization that is first to the frontlines of crises.

A heroine, forgotten by history, who fearlessly saved Jewish lives. The name of her husband Oskar Schindler became synonymous with acts of compassion and humanity in the Nazi era. But what role did his wife Emilie Schindler play?

Filmmaker Annette Baumeister tells the story of Emilie Schindler, who protected people without attracting much attention. After the war, Emilie was abandoned by her husband and forgotten by the world. 

Emilie Pelzl was born in the Sudetenland in 1907. From an early age, she worked on her parents' farm and cared for relatives. At the age of 20, she fell in love with the charming Oskar Schindler. Although he was considered a heartbreaker, she married him. Oskar had affairs and squandered the dowry, but Emilie stuck by him. During World War Two, the Schindlers ran factories and employed Jewish workers - saving many of them from the death camps.

In this documentary, Emilie Schindler's Argentinian carer Leandro Coseforti, her niece Traude Ferrari, and historians all describe a forgotten heroine. Annette Baumeister sensitively reconstructs Emilie Schindler's life, bringing her out of her husband's shadow. 

The film draws a picture of a woman who risked her life to help others. By procuring food and medicine for those in need, she helped to rescue many Jewish people right under the noses of the SS.

Fingerprints have long been known to be completely unique. They also don‚Äôt change their pattern over your lifetime, making them an extremely useful biometric for identification. Their uniqueness largely comes from how they form in the womb: as waves of skin cells growing in random patterns of ridges under the top layer of skin in our hands and feet.

Fingerprints are so unique that it is considered impossible to match two different fingerprints from the same person ‚Äî the only way to know for sure is to match a fingerprint to the exact finger. But a new AI tool developed by students at Columbia University says there are more similarities in intra-person, or same person, fingerprints than we‚Äôve previously known.

Between 1947 and 1967, black-owned homes in Birmingham, Alabama were bombed over 50 times. Homes on Center Street were targeted so often, the neighborhood became known as ‚ÄòDynamite Hill.‚Äô What happened on Center Street is a scar on American history, but the voices of Dynamite Hill speak with strength and grace about how they faced unimaginable hatred, with one repeated refrain: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still here.‚Äù

Well we can! Thanks to the extraordinary work of the artist hans Holbein the Younger.

Professor Suzannah Lipscomb goes to Buckingham Palace to enter the gallery of the Royal Collection where a brilliant exhibition of Hans Holbein‚Äôs works takes us to the very heart of life in the Tudor court - meeting the men and women who witnessed and changed history, Anne Boleyn, Thomas More, Jane Seymour.  Thanks to the amazingly characterful drawings of Hans Holbein the Younger we can look them in the eye, weigh them up, consider their motives. 

Suzannah explores the movers and shakers of Henry VIII‚Äôs inner circle - including one very special Holbein portrait that could be of Anne Boleyn herself, captured in a reflective and intimate moment. Experts have long debated whether it could be Anne at the time she was queen.  Now Suzannah and Royal Collections curator Kate Heard discuss the evidence and reach a thrilling conclusion. 

And there are other stars of the Tudor world here too - Thomas More, the great humanist, lawyer and politician; Thomas Wyatt, the mercurial diplomat ; as well as lesser known people like Frances De Vere, a dynamic woman captured on paper by Holbein‚Äôs genius.

Discover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Mary Beard and more.

But a Bloomberg investigation reveals that several private hospital companies funded by the IFC have kept patients in their care until they can cover their bills or otherwise satisfy the hospital they will be able to pay. This policy can, at times, keep people from going home many days after they are medically ready for discharge. One healthcare company in the Philippines says it‚Äôs just following the law.

Using modern genetic techniques, they‚Äôre extracting ancient genetic material from museum exhibits. Do their efforts represent hope for the future of the natural world? Or is science playing God?

Findings in the thawed permafrost of Siberia have made it possible to reconstruct the DNA of mammoths. Researchers are now experimenting with inserting genes related to the ability to resist cold temperatures into the Asian elephant, which is related to the mammoth. The animals thus created could survive in the steppes of Siberia and Alaska. 

In Australia, scientists have managed to extract the genetic material of marsupial wolves from preserved embryos in museums. The predator‚Äôs genes are replicated in the lab and implanted into the related marsupial mouse - in a bid to bring the extinct creature back to life. 

And biotechnology could also help white rhinos in Africa: Researchers in Berlin are fertilizing eggs from the last two living females with sperm from deceased males frozen and preserved for decades. 

However, these practices are also attracting criticism. Biology researchers question the usefulness of revived species for natural habitats. They fear that the excitement surrounding the idea of bringing back extinct species could distract people from the many problems that cause animals to disappear, in the first place. Are some scientists playing God - with unforeseeable consequences for the environment?

Uncover new archaeological evidence rewriting our understanding of the Dark Ages in 5th- and 6th-century Britain that might also explain the legend of King Arthur. [Originally aired in 2019]

After four centuries of occupation and leadership, the Romans left Britain in 410 AD and the island‚Äôs fate was left hanging in the balance. History teaches that in the 5th century, the country descended into a tumultuous and violent period known as the Dark Ages, leaving the nation vulnerable to invading Angle and Saxon hordes from northern Europe. With a nation divided, a great leader known as King Arthur emerged, uniting the lawless lands to fight off invaders ‚Äì or at least that‚Äôs what the fragmentary historical texts suggest. The truth is, no one really knows what happened, and this pivotal moment in history has been shrouded in mystery ‚Äì until now.

#JoyRidePBS

JOYRIDE is a short-form interview series that pairs younger generations with older adults as they explore the world together on trishaw bikes. The show is inspired by the global non-profit, Cycling Without Age, which takes older adults on trishaw outings to feel the wind in their hair. From the Santa Barbara coastline to Barcelona beaches, each episode unlocks the lived experiences of today‚Äôs older generation, who have become increasingly removed from the flow of daily life. This series will create new conditions for generations to collide, share experiences, and be inspired by a sense of place and nostalgia.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Germany before the election - Between hopes and fears | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQqeKbWxH4</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/HOQqeKbWxH4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 17:00:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[War in the Middle East, war in Ukraine, migration, rising prices, and more ‚Äì plenty of reasons for Germany to worry, and just as many to take action.

Following the collapse of Germany‚Äôs governing coalition in the fall, early parliamentary elections are now due to take place at the end of February. DW reporters Oxana Evdokimova and Carolina Machhaus  traveled around Germany, speaking to people who are worried about what the future holds, but who are also tackling and helping to solve problems. According to one survey, the cost of living and the gap between rich and poor are particularly problematic in Germany. Food prices, for example, have risen by around a third since 2020.. Munich food bank founder Hannelore Kiethe says that demand has been rising ever since its founding. Affordable housing is another issue that concerns people in Germany, especially in the big cities. Christa Lippmann has founded a housing project for single women, with success. Dietmar Kibbel is concerned that Germany does not have enough skilled workers to get the economy moving again and is involved in a program for applicants to qualify as train drivers within a year ‚Äî a highly skilled profession and one that is highly in demand across the country. It is an opportunity for Abdullah Alyaqub, who fled his home country of Syria ten years ago and hopes that his new job will give him more financial security.

In recent decades, Gassed was interpreted as a very yellow painting. But it didn‚Äôt always look like that. 

The yellow effect comes from a discoloured varnish from the 1970s, concealing Sargent‚Äôs intentions and skewing our interpretation of his work. Now, thanks to meticulous conservation efforts as part of IWM‚Äôs new Blavatnik Art, Film and Photography Galleries, Gassed and its meaning have been reborn.
 
Today we‚Äôre going to examine the history of Gassed, what it means, why it‚Äôs important, and how that has changed over 100 years on display.

How much more physics is out there to be discovered? Neil deGrasse Tyson sits down with physicist, professor, and rockstar Brian Cox, to discuss everything from the Higgs boson, life beyond our planet, and the fundamental forces that guide our universe.

We dive into the cutting-edge world of particle physics. Brian explains the incredible discoveries made at CERN, including the Higgs boson, and why smashing protons together at nearly the speed of light unlocks the building blocks of the universe. What mysteries remain in the standard model of physics? Brian unpacks the search for supersymmetry, extra dimensions, and dark matter while highlighting the challenges of exploring particles that only exist fleetingly after high-energy collisions.

The conversation then shifts to the grand cosmic scale. Brian and Neil explore the relationship between particle physics and astrophysics. Could gravity be a particle? What do these nearly massless particles tell us about the universe‚Äôs deeper truths? And how might the future of experiments like the Large Hadron Collider reshape our understanding of reality?

To wrap up, Brian shares his passion for public science communication and the philosophical questions that drive his work. Learn about his global live tour, Horizons, which combines stunning visuals, classical music, and a celebration of the universe‚Äôs vastness. Discover the excitement behind upcoming missions like the Europa Clipper and how moons like Europa and Io may hold the keys to extraterrestrial life.

With a mix of rock and roll energy, groundbreaking physics, and profound philosophical questions, this episode takes you on a journey through the smallest particles to the largest structures in the cosmos‚Äîand everything in between.

After living in the United States for six decades, he returned to Germany in 2012. Ever since then, he‚Äôs been working to educate people.

Unlike many adults, younger people aren‚Äôt as reserved when meeting the Holocaust survivor. They ask him all sorts of questions and take selfies with him - including the concentration camp tattoo on his arm.

Weinberg was born in the East Frisia region of northern Germany in 1925. Adolf Hitler taking power in 1933 changed the trajectory of his family life forever. Like other Jewish families, the Weinberg‚Äôs were victims of persecution, exploitation, and murder. Albrecht's parents, Alfred and Flora, were killed in Auschwitz. Albrecht himself survived and emigrated to the United States.

He finally returned to Germany 13 years ago. Since then he‚Äôs been trying to reconcile himself with the country of his birth. At his side is his former nurse, Gerda D√§nekas - the two are now roommates and best friends. For years, Albrecht and Gerda have been working to raise awareness about the Holocaust and ensure its remembrance. They visit schools and memorial sites, give speeches, and talk to the media. Recent developments, such as antisemitic incidents in Germany and the rise of right-wing extremists, have motivated the pair to maintain their fight against hatred and antisemitism for as long as possible.

This film shows the two friends going about their work, as well as their everyday life together. Even though 99-year-old Albrecht Weinberg no longer has the energy he used to, Gerda is committed to sharing his story, as well as that of other Holocaust victims.
